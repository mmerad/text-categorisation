<TITLE>CRUDE OIL NETBACKS UP SHARPLY IN EUROPE, U.S.</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Crude oil netback values in complex
refineries rose sharply in Europe and firmed in the U.S. last
Friday from the previous week but fell sharply in Singapore,
according to calculations by Reuters Pipeline.
    The firmer tone to refining margins in Europe and the U.S.
relected higher prices for petroleum products, particularly
gasoline, and support from crude oil prices.
    Netback values for crude oil refined in Northern Europe
rose substantially following strong gains in gasoline prices
there. Brent is valued at 19.45 dlrs, up 56 cts a barrel or
three pct from the previous week.
    In the U.S. Gulf, sweet crudes rose in value by 14 cts to
19.33 dlrs for West Texas Intermediate, up about 0.7 pct.
    Sour grades in the U.S. Gulf showed an increase of 33 cts a
barrel for Alaska North Slope, up 1.7 pct.
    But netbacks for crude oil refined in Singapore fell
sharply, down 15 cts to as much as 68 cts a barrel as ample
distillate supplies weighed on petroleum product prices.
    Attaka in Singapore is valued at 18.55 dlrs, a decline of
68 cts a barrel or 3.5 pct from the previous week.
    For refineries in the Mediterranean, netback values were
mostly lower, with declines of seven to 14 cts. The value of
Kuwait crude fell 14 cts to 18.37 dlrs, while Iranian Light
fell 11 cts to 19.14 dlrs.
    On the U.S. West Coast, netback values for ANS CIF L.A.
also jumped sharply, up 40 cts a barrel or 2.2 pct to 18.82
dlrs on higher gasoline prices.

<TITLE>TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS SYSTEM NEEDS STABILITY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker said
the floating exchange rate system has not been as effective as
had been hoped in promoting stability and preventing imbalances
from emerging in the global economy.
    In remarks before the afternoon session of the
International Monetary Fund's Interim Committee, Baker said he
was not suggesting that the system should be abandoned.
    "But I do suggest," he said, "that we need something to give
it more stability and to keep it headed in the right direction
when the wind shifts."
    He said that indicators can serve "as a kind of compass" but
added that structural indicators can help focus attention on
some policies.
    Baker, however, said the IMF "needs to move beyond
macroeconomic indicators and find structural indicators that
can help focus attention on some of the policies of specific
relevance to the imbalances we face today."
    The Treasury Secretary said that indicators should be given
a more prominent role in the annual economic reviews -- Article
IV consultations -- that the Fund performs.
    Baker also told the policy making group that it was time
for the IMF to adopt earlier recommendations making IMF
surveillance more relevant to national policymakers and the
public.
    "In particular, we urge increased publicity for IMF
appraisals developed in Article IV consultations, the use of
follow-up reports on country actions to implement IMF
recommendations, and greater use of special consultation
procedures," he said.
    Baker emphasized that indicators were a device "for moving
beyond rhetoric to action."
    He said they provide "more structure to the system, and
induce more discipline and peer pressure into the process of
policy coordination."
    He said the Fund's procedures for surveillance need to be
reviewed and updated to reflect the use of indicators.
    "This should be matter of priority for the executive board,"
he said.
    Baker also urged the Fund to develop alternative
medium-term economic scenarios for countries that "can help us
focus even more clearly on the most important imbalances, by
identifying options for addressing them and analyzing the
implications of these options."
    He said also that further work should be done on finding
paths that lead toward possible medium-term objectives.
    "If we are to take effective remedial action when there are
significant deviations from an intended course, then we must
have more definitive ways of indentifying the right course for
key variables," he said.

<TITLE>U.S. DOLLAR LOSSES PROPEL BROAD COMMODITY GAINS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    by Keith Leighty, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Commodities from gold to grains to
cotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as losses
in the U.S. dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears of
inflation and economic instability.
    Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in New
York, where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs a
troy ounce, and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce.
    A key factor behind the advance was anticipation that
inflation will be the only way for the major industrial nations
to halt the slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, said Steve
Chronowitz, director of commodity research with Smith Barney,
Harris Upham and Co., in New York.
    The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials from
the seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed their
commitment to support its value, and despite reports of
intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, traders said.
    Traders said it appears that the industrial nations, known
as the Group of Seven, lack the ability to change the long-term
direction of the currency markets.
    "Maybe they have some ideas or plans," said Chronowitz. "If
they do, it's not evident."
    "It looks like there's no cure but to let the free market
take values to where they should be.
    "One way or another, we will force our major trading
partners to stimulate their economies," as a measure to correct
the mounting U.S. trade deficit, Chronowitz said.
    "I think the markets believe, and have believed for a long
time, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. It's
going to be a long and tedious process, but that's what's
happening," he said.
    The falling value of the dollar makes U.S. commodities
cheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand.
    At the same time, traders who are holding stocks and bonds
saw the value of their investments falling and many are turning
to commodities such as precious metals as a hedge, said Marty
McNeill, a metals analyst in New York with the trading house of
Dominick and Dominick.
    The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughout
the commodities markets, as grains, livestock, and cotton
posted broad gains.
    Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said attention in the
grain markets has shifted from concern about burdensome
supplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulate
export demand.
    After the close of trading, the Agriculture Department
raised its estimate for grain imports by the Soviet Union by
two mln tonnes from the month-earlier report.
    Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle were moderately
higher.
    Analysts said several factors boosted hog prices. They said
hogs haven't been making the weight gains that are normal at
this time of year, and farmers have been too busy with field
work to market animals.

<TITLE>MOORE &lt;MCL> SEES SUBSTANTIAL 1987 PROFIT GAIN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Moore Corp Ltd expects 1987 profits from
continuing operations will exceed 1986 results and recover to
1985 levels when the company earned 152 mln U.S. dlrs or 1.70
dlrs a share, president M. Keith Goodrich said.
    "We'll have a substantial increase in earnings from
continuing operations," he told reporters after the annual
meeting. He said he expected profits would recover last year's
lost ground and reach 1985 results.
    In 1986, profits from continuing operations slumped to
139.5 mln dlrs or 1.54 dlrs a share. The total excluded losses
of 30 mln dlrs on discontinued operations.
    Goodrich said Moore is still actively looking for
acquisitions related to its core areas of business forms
manufacturing or handling.
    "We could do a large acquisition," he said when asked if
the company could raise as much as one billion dlrs for this
purpose.
    Chairman Judson Sinclair, answering a shareholder's
question, told the annual meeting that a special resolution
passed by shareholders to create a new class of preferred
shares would allow Moore to move quickly if it decided to
pursue an acquisition.
    "If we were to make a major acquisition ... it means we can
move with a certain expediency," Sinclair said.
    Asked if the resolution was designed to give Moore
protection from a possible hostile takeover, Sinclair said
only, "I know of no threat to the corporation at this time."

<TITLE>ANALYSTS DOUBT FED FIRMED DESPITE BORROWING RISE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Martin Cherrin, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Economists said that they doubt the
Federal Reserve is firming policy to aid the dollar, despite
higher discount window borrowings in the latest two-week
statement period and very heavy borrowings Wednesday.
    Data out today show net borrowings from the Fed averaged
393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to Wednesday, up from 265 mln
dlrs in the prior statement period. Wednesday borrowings were
1.4 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct.
    "One could make a case that the Fed is firming, but it
probably isn't," said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds.
    Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policy
modestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in the
two-weeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averaging
around 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months.
    However, the Dean Witter economist noted that the latest
two-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demand
often pushes up borrrowings.
    "Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy, but it
looks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisions
late in the statement period and didn't quite make it," said
Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
    A Fed spokesman told a press press conference today that
the Fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs or
more in its reserve projections in the week ended Wednesday.
    Still, McCarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss in
its estimates over the week that caused it to add fewer
reserves earlier in the week than were actually needed.
    The Fed took no market reserve management action last
Thursday and Friday, the first two days of the week. It added
temporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs of
customer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves
directly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday.
    Based on Fed data out today, economists calculated that the
two-day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged on
Tuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs. They put Wednesday's
overnight System repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs.
    "It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy at
this time," said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.
    Citing the view shared by the other two economists, Leuzzi
said the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interest
rates to help the dollar because that would harm already weak
economies in the United States and abroad and add to the
financial stress of developing countries and their lenders.
    "Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the latest
statement period have to explain why it acted before the dollar
tumbled," said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch.
    He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a new
statement period began today on disappointment yesterday's
Washington meetings of international monetary officials failed
to produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid.
    In fact, currency dealers said there was nothing in
Wednesday's G-7 communique to alter the prevailing view that
the yen needs to rise further to redress the huge trade
imbalance between the United States and Japan.
    The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming for
steady policy now that should correspond to a weekly average
Fed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct. This is about where
the rate has been since early November.
    "I'm not so sure that the Fed is engineering a tighter
policy to help the dollar, as some suspect," said Sullivan of
Dean Witter.
    If it is, however, he said that Fed probably has just
nudged up its funds rate goal to around 6.25 to 6.35 pct from
six to 6.10 pct previously.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - The World Bank said it approved a 70-</DATELINE><BODY>mln-dlr, 20-year loan to assist Pakistan in a project designed
to improve power plant efficiency.
    Noting that a shortage of power constrains Pakistan's
economic development, the Bank said one objective of the
project is to provide at least 200 megawatts of additional
generating capacity.
    Another objective is to improve the efficiency with which
hydrocarbons are used by Pakistan's Water and Power Development
Authority (WAPDA) in power production, it said. One effect of
this would be reduced atmospheric pollution.

<TITLE>DOLLAR OPENS AT TOKYO RECORD LOW OF 143.75 YEN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 10 - </DATELINE><BODY>The dollar opened at a record Tokyo low
of 143.75 yen despite aggressive Bank of Japan intervention,
dealers said.
    The previous record low was 144.70 yen set on March 30. The
opening compares with 143.90/144.00 yen at the close in New
York.
    The central bank bought dollars through Tokyo brokers just
before and after the market opening, the dealers said.
    The intervention took place when the dollar fell to 143.20
yen, one dealer said.
    The dollar opened at 1.8155/60 marks against 1.8187/97 in
New York.
    The dollar fell as low as 142.90 yen despite central bank
intervention at 143.00 yen, dealers said.
    Selling pressure was strong from securities houses and
institutional investors in hectic and nervous trading on
underlying bearish sentiment for the dollar, they said.
    Most dealers were surpised by the dollar's sharp fall
against the yen in New York, although many had expected such a
drop to happen eventually.
    Institutional investors are expected to sell the dollar
aggressively if it rises to around 143.50 yen, dealers said.
    The U.S. Currency steadied well above 143.00 yen after Bank
of Japan intervention and scattered short-covering, they said.
    The dollar opened at 1.5120/30 Swiss francs against
1.5085/00 at the New York close.
    Sterling started at 1.6190/00 dlrs against 1.6195/05.

<TITLE>U.S. MARKETS OFFER GLIMPSE OF VOLCKER NIGHTMARE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alan Wheatley, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Today's turmoil in the U.S. Financial
markets, with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollar's
wake, is evidence of a major shift in investor psychology that
is likely to spell more turbulence ahead, economists said.
    For two years, the markets had hailed the dollar's decline
as the cure-all for the U.S. Trade deficit. Interest rates fell
sharply and Wall Street became a one-way street, up.
    But that confidence is now cracking as the financial
markets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volcker's
often-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse.
    "Volcker's been saying for a long time that a dollar
freefall would be extremely dangerous - now he's got it," said
David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.
    The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in
40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington
failed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have a
credible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances, short
of further depreciation of the dollar.
    Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amid
worries that the dollar's slide will rekindle inflation, scare
away foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit.
    The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12
dlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce, while the spike
in interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average down
by 33 points to 2339.
    Norman Robertson, Mellon Bank chief economist, called the
markets' instability frightening. He believes economic
fundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that "once
you start the ball rolling it's difficult to stop."
    "There's a stark possibility that you could get a
destabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates
and drives us into recession. The markets are in a panic."
    Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics
in Washington, has been warning for a long time that the
controlled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and
264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare.
    "We're still more or less on track for a hard landing... But
the agony may be fairly drawn out," Marris told Reuters.
    Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this
year, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it
would take very little to touch off what he calls the second
phase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in the
dollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession.
    The stock market's reaction today and its sharp drop on
March 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about.
    The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with
historical experience, which teaches that domestic markets are
not affected until a currency is in the final stages of its
decline, Marris said. He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen.
    Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar's latest
weakness was the loss of credibility that central banks
suffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling
below 150 yen, the floor that the market believes was set as
part of the G-7 Paris agreement in February.
    Robertson at Mellon, by contrast, said the loss of
confidence was triggered last week when Washington announced
plans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronic
imports, raising the specter of a debilitating trade war.
    Many economists believe that long-run stability will not
return to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is
addressed - excessive consumption in the U.S., Reflected in the
massive budget deficit.
    But in the short term, given the failure of the G-7 and of
central bank intervention, some feel that the Fed will have no
choice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar.
    "The only thing that will stop the dollar falling is a
substantial increase in the discount rate and a corresponding
cut abroad, at least by Japan," said Lanston's Jones.
    Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interest
rates, even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for
American farmers, Latin American governments and others.
    But Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs and
Co, scoffed at the notion. "It's ridiculous to think the Federal
Reserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak
against just one currency. This is yen strength, not dollar
weakness," he said.
    Giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being
made toward reducing the U.S. Budget deficit.
    "We're going to have one of the biggest reductions in the
budget deficit relative to GNP in history this year, and nobody
cares," he said, noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69
will have been greater.
    He said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and
thinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year.
    But for now, market psychology has changed so abruptly that
a further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out. "Put on
your helmets," Giordano said.

<TITLE>JAPAN HAS NO PLANS TO CUT DISCOUNT RATE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bank of Japan sources said the bank
has no plans to cut its discount rate.
    They told reporters that there was no pressure on Japan
during the Group of Seven (G-7) meeting here yesterday to lower
its discount rate. They added that they themselves do not feel
any need for a cut at all.
    Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told reporters
earlier today that some countries - those with strong
currencies - might have to cut interest rates.
    The Bank of Japan sources also said that it was too soon to
call the G-7 pact a failure.
    The central bank sources were commenting on the dollar's
renewed tumble in New York and Tokyo, which was sparked by
remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that the
dollar's fall had been orderly.
    They said the market must have misinterpreted Baker's
comments because he was referring to the dollar's fall since
the Plaza agreement in September 1985, over a long-time span,
not the currency's recent movements.
    They added that the foreign exchange markest seem to seize
on anything to use as an excuse to drive the dollar one way or
the other.
    The Bank of Japan sources said the U.S. Is putting more
weight on the dollar/yen rate in terms of judging market
stability than on other currencies.
    Throughout the G-7 meeting, Japan pointed to the dangers
that would arise from a further dollar fall because it would
reduce the flow of Japanese capital to the U.S., Hurting the
U.S. And world economies, they said.
    In February and in March of this year, Japanese investors
reduced their purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds, the sources
said.
    Each country in the G-7 - Britain, Canada, France, Italy,
Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - has a different view about
currency stability, the Bank of Japan sources said.
    This is because the overall foreign exchange market is a
triangle of dollar/yen, European currencies/yen and
dollar/European currencies.
    At the time of the Louvre agreement, European countries did
not want the yen to weaken against their currencies so they did
not object to the yen strengthening, they said.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIAN UNIONS AND NSW GOVERNMENT REACH DEAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, April 10 - </DATELINE><BODY>Union and New South Wales government
officials have reached a compromise in a dispute over workers
compensation, averting increased industrial action in the
state, union sources said.
    But some unions, including those of building and mining
workers, said they were dissatisfied with the deal and would
continue their strikes for a few more days.
    State officials said the government had agreed to revise
its proposals to cut compensation and would allow slightly
higher cash benefits for injured workers.
    Under the original proposal, which sparked strikes and
other industrial action in the state on April 7, workers'
compensation would have been cut by one third. Full details of
the compromise package are not yet known.
    The Labour Council, affiliated to the Australian Council of
Trade Unions (ACTU), had threatened to paralyse New South Wales
unless the government modified its pending legislation on the
issue.
    State officials said the only sectors affected in the past
three days were some government building projects, railway
freight movement and cargo handling in Sydney's ports.

<DATELINE>    QUITO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ecuador is due to resume limited crude oil
output on May 8 when a new 43 km pipeline to neighbouring
Colombia should be finished, an energy ministry spokesman said.
    Oil output was halted on March 5 by an earthquake which
damaged 50 km of the main pipeline linking jungle oilfields at
Lago Agrio to the Ecuadorean port of Balao on the Pacific.
    About 13 km of the new link, capable of carrying some
50,000 barrels per day (bpd), has been built, he said.
    Ecuador pumped 245,000 to 250,000 bpd before the
earthquake.
    The new link will connect Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon in
Colombia, the starting point of Columbia's pipeline to the
Pacific ocean port of Temuco.
    The government estimates it will take about four more
months to repair the Lago Agrio to Balao pipeline and return
output to normal levels, the spokesman said.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan warned the United States it may
take retaliatory measures if the United States imposes its
planned trade sanctions on April 17, a senior government
official said.
    Shinji Fukukawa, Vice Minister of the International Trade
and Industry Ministry, said in a statement Japan would consider
measures under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and
other actions if the United States imposes 100 pct tariffs on
some Japanese exports as planned next week.
    However, Fukukawa said Japan was ready to continue trade
talks with the United States despite its failure to convince
America to call off the threatened tariffs during two days of
emergency talks which ended in Washington yesterday.
    Last month President Reagan announced the sanctions in
retaliation for what he called Japan's failure to honour a July
1986 agreement to stop dumping computer microchips in markets
outside the United States and to open its home market to
American goods.
    Fukukawa said the United States had regrettably not
listened to Japan's explanation of its efforts to live up the
pact and said Washington had not given any detailed explanation
of why it planned to impose the tariffs.

nation's second largest employer closed its doors yesterday,
saying it had been run out of business by sugar smuggled from
Miami and the neighbouring Dominican Republic.
    The closure of the Haitian American Sugar Company (HASCO)
will idle 3,500 employees and affect as many as 30,000 to
40,000 small sugar cane planters in regions around the capital,
the company said.
    "Because of unprecedented and ever-growing smuggling, HASCO
regrets ... It cannot continue to accept delivery of sugar cane
after April 10," the mill warned planters earlier this week.
    Since President Jean-Claude Duvalier fled Haiti fourteen
months ago, widescale smuggling of basic goods such as cooking
oil, flour, rice, sugar and canned milk has lowered consumer
prices but bankrupted several local manufacturers, throwing
hundreds of thousands of Haitians out of work.
    At the HASCO compound, where grim-faced workers lined up to
receive their last pay, Spokesman Georges D. Rigaud showed a
warehouse stocked with an estimated 445,000 unsold 100-pound
(45-kg) bags of sugar.
    "We are closing because of our huge stock of unsold sugar.
We have no money left to continue operations," Rigaud said.
    He said the company owed 7.6 mln dlrs and had borrowed an
additional 1.5 mln dlrs in order to pay off workers.
    Rigaud blamed the mill's problems on an order by Duvalier
two years ago forbidding HASCO from refining sugar.
    He said the government then began importing refined sugar
at world market prices and reselling it at a huge profit and
the provisional military-civilian government that replaced
Duvalier last year continued the policy.
    "But now with all the smuggling even the state can't compete
with smuggled Dominican refined sugar," Rigaud said.
    HASCO workers earned 4.20 dlrs daily, considerably above
the usual minimum wage of three dlrs.
    It is generally estimated that every employed Haitian
supports at least six people. Rigaud said HASCO's closing at a
minimum would affect 280,000 to 300,000 people.
    Laid-off workers were bitter about the closure. "We're dead,
and it's the government that's causing us to die," declared
Lucien Felix, 34, who has five dependents.

<TITLE>TAIWAN ANNOUNCES NEW ROUND OF IMPORT TARIFF CUTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, April 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>Taiwan announced plans for another round
of import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before trade
talks with Washington which officials described as a move to
help balance trade with the United States.
    Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry's
Customs Administration Department, told reporters the list of
products included 60 items asked by Washington.
    "The move is part of our government efforts to encourage
imports from our trading partners, particularly from the United
States," he said.
    He said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinet
that the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles,
apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cut
by between five and 50 pct.
    The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursday
and the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly starting
on April 20, he added.
    Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700
foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce its
growing trade surplus with the United States, the island's
largest trading partner.
    Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts and
pressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge trade
deficit with Taipei.
    Washington's deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6
billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985. It
widened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78
billion a year earlier, Taiwan's official figures show.
    Today's announcement came before a departure later today of
a 15-member Taiwan delegation for Washington for a series of
trade talks with U.S. Officials.
    The delegation's leader, Vincent Siew, told reporters last
night he was leaving with "a heavy heart," meaning that he would
face tough talks in Washington because of rising protectionist
sentiments in the U.S. Congress. Taiwan's 1986 trade surplus
with Washington was the third largest, after Japan and Canada.
    Siew said the talks, starting on April 14, would cover U.S.
Calls for Taiwan to open its market to American products,
purchases of major U.S. Machinery and power plant equipment,
import tariff cuts and protection of intellectual property.
    "I am afraid this time we have to give more than take from
our talks with the U.S.," he said without elaborating.

<TITLE>BRITISH MINISTER SAYS HE WARNED TOKYO OF SANCTIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>A British minister said he had given the
Japanese government a clear warning of sanctions against
Japanese companies if Tokyo did not allow more access to its
internal markets "and it was clearly understood."
    Corporate Affairs Minister Michael Howard said on his
return from a visit to Japan he thought the Japanese were
beginning to appreciate the need to be "fair and open" about
access to their own markets.
    At an airport news conference Howard denied opposition
charges that his trip had been a failure because he had
returned empty-handed.
    "I did what I set out to do. I was sent to deliver a clear
message to the Japanese government, and I delivered it very
clearly, and it has been clearly understood."
    Howard said that under the Financial Services Act the
govenment had considerable flexibility in taking sanctions
against Japanese companies and finance houses operating in
Britain.
    "It is not simply a question of withdrawing or refusing
operating licences. We can ban firms from certain countries
from carrying out certain kinds of business, while allowing
them to carry out other kinds."
    "I hope we don't have to use these powers, but I made it
clear in Japan that if our timetable isn't met, we shall use
them."
    He said it would be unfortunate if Britain and Japan became
involved in a tit-for-tat exchange, adding that Japan gained
more than anyone else from an open trading relationship.
    "I think they are beginning to appreciate that if this
relationship is to continue, it is very important for them to
be fair and open about access to their own markets."
    On the question of the British firm Cable and Wireless Plc
&lt;CAWL.L>, which is trying to win a significant share of
telecommunications contracts in Japan, Howard said he had told
the Japanese this was being widely regarded as a test case.
    He said there were signs of movement on the case. Cable and
Wireless was due to take part in talks in Japan next Tuesday,
he said.
    Earlier this week British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
said Britain could not go it alone on sanctions against Japan,
but would have to coordinate action with its European Community
partners.
    Community sources said after a meeting of trade officials
yesterday that the group might impose steep new tariffs on a
range of Japanese goods to prevent diversion from United States
markets if Washington imposes trade sanctions against Tokyo as
it has threatened.

<TITLE>UGANDA PULLS OUT OF COFFEE MARKET - TRADE SOURCES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KAMPALA, April 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>Uganda's Coffee Marketing Board (CMB)
has stopped offering coffee on the international market because
it is unhappy with current prices, coffee trade sources said.
    The board suspended offerings last week but because of its
urgent need for cash it was not immediately clear how long it
could sustain, the sources added.
    Hundreds of Ugandan coffee farmers and processors have been
waiting several months for payment from the CMB, which has had
trouble finding enough railway wagons to move the coffee to the
Kenyan port of Mombasa.
    Foreign banks have contributed to the cash crisis by
holding up remittance of Uganda's hard currency earnings from
coffee exports, the government newspaper New Vision said.
    The banks are holding up to seven mln dlrs in coffee money
and President Yoweri Museveni is thinking of imposing a penalty
for such delays, it added.
    Banking sources said a third factor in the crisis was that
commercial banks have lent the board only 77 billion shillings
-- the equivalent of 55 mln dlrs -- for crop finance in the
current coffee year, while the government had asked for 100
billion.
    The CMB has 455,000 60-kg bags of coffee, about 15 pct of
annual production, stockpiled in Kampala awaiting shipment.
    The crop accounts for over 90 pct of Uganda's export
earnings and the recent slide in prices to four-year lows is
likely to more than offset an expected increase in production.
    CMB officials have forecast that because the government has
restored law and order in important growing areas, Uganda will
produce over three mln bags of coffee in the year ending
September 30, about 25 pct more than in 1985/6.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>DRY SPELL IN PHILIPPINES DAMAGES AGRICULTURE CROPS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, April 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>A prolonged dry spell has damaged
111,350 hectares of rice and corn plantations in 10 provinces
in the central and southern Philippines, agriculture officials
said.
    They said some 71,070 tonnes of agricultural produce
estimated at about 250 mln pesos was lost to the lack of
rainfall. They warned of a severe drought if the prevailing
conditions continued until next month.
    Agriculture Secretary Carlos Dominguez said he hoped the
losses would be offset by the expected increase in output in
other, normally more productive areas not affected by the dry
spell.
    Affected were 14,030 hectares of palay (unmilled rice),
representing a production loss of 22,250 tonnes valued at 77.8
mln pesos, Department of Agriculture reports said.
    About 48,820 tonnes of corn from 97,320 hectares valued at
170.8 mln pesos have also been lost, they said.
    Officials said the hectarage planted to palay that has been
hit by the drought accounted for only one pct of national total
thus the damage is considered negligible.
    In the case of corn, they said the loss can be filled by
production from non-traditional corn farms which diversified
into the cash crop from sugar two years ago.
     The Philippine Coconut Authority said coconut production
in the major producing region of Bicol might drop by 25 pct to
320,000 tonnes if the dry spell continued. There were no
reports of actual damage.

<TITLE>HUNGARY RAISES PRICES IN EFFORT TO CURB DEFICIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BUDAPEST, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hungary has announced sharp price
increases for a range of food and consumer products as part of
its efforts to curb a soaring budget deficit.
    The official MTI news agency said the government decided
consumer price subsidies had to be cut to reduce state
spending. From today the price of meat will rise by an average
18 pct and that of beer and spirits by 10 pct, MTI said.
    MTI said consumer goods will also become more expensive,
with the price of refrigerators rising some five pct. It also
announced a number of measures to ease hardship, including
higher pensions and family allowances.
    Statistics indicate the budget deficit tripled in 1986 to
47 billion forints. Central banker Janos Fekete has said the
Finance Ministry is trying to cut the 1987 shortfall to between
30 and 35 billion from a planned 43.8 billion.
    A major tax reform, including the introduction of a
Western-style valued added tax, is planned for January 1988 in
an effort to cure problems in state spending.
    But diplomats said the latest announcement shows the
authorities were forced to act quickly to keep this year's
deficit under control.
    The measures are also aimed at cooling an overheated
economy, and could help dampen Hungarians' appetite for
imported Western goods which consume increasingly expensive
hard currency, the diplomats said.
    The diplomats also said, however, that they did not expect
the kind of social unrest that followed sharp price rises in
other East Bloc states, notably Poland.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT MUST CUT SPENDING, ANZ SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The government must announce harsh cuts
in spending in its May 14 economic statement if it is to give
an adequate response to Australia's economic problems, the ANZ
Banking Group Ltd &lt;ANZA.S> said.
    Cuts of two billion dlrs would be insufficient against the
backdrop of a 12 billion dlr government deficit and a 14
billion dlr current account deficit, it said in its monthly
Business Indicators publication.
    "For the past two years, the government has struggled with
an economic reality that demands measures beyond those which it
sees as politically practicable," it said.
    The political climate meant there would be a continued
over-reliance on monetary policy to hold the exchange rate and
maintain confidence in economic management, ANZ said.
    "The cost of this approach is that the much-needed revival
of business investment will be further postponed," it said.
    The economy was now on a modest growth upswing boosted by
export and import-replacement industries which had created a
false suggestion that the worst adjustments to the balance of
payments crisis were past. "Unfortunately, successful adjustment
to Australia's deep-seated economic problems remains a
long-term process," it said.
    In its economic forecasts, ANZ said it expected moderate
overall economic growth with gross domestic product (GDP)
rising 2.7 pct this year and 2.4 pct in 1988.
    The current account deficit would narrow to five pct of GDP
this year and 4.3 pct in 1988 and net foreign debt would grow
strongly from 81 billion at the end of 1986 to 97.2 billion at
end-1987 and 110.3 billion a year later.
    Inflation would fall to 8.5 pct in 1987 and 7.5 pct in 1988
from 8.9 pct in 1986 and further falls in real wages were
expected, ANZ said.

code will not affect the majority of its businesses.
    It said its subsidiaries, which account for 96 pct of its
32.6 billion dlrs in revenues and 79 pct of its net property,
plant and equipment, were free of the action.
    Only parent holding company, Texaco Inc, and operating
subsidiaries, Texaco Capital Inc and Texaco Capital N.V, are
affected, it said.
    But the company said it was likely to suspend its 75 cents
per share quarterly common stock dividend and halt repayments
on debts of some 6.8 billion dlrs.
    Texaco said it filed for Chaper 11 because suppliers were
demanding cash payments and banks were withholding loans as a
result of a legal dispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL>.
    Texaco is fighting a Texas law requiring it to post a bond
of more than 10 billion dlrs before it can appeal a 1985
judgment that ruled it illegally interfered with Pennzoil's
1984 acquisition of Getty Petroleum Corp &lt;GTY>. The bond almost
matches the damages awarded against Texaco.
    Should Texaco fail to place the bond, Pennzoil could begin
to attach its assets to secure the judgment.
    Last Monday, the Supreme Court overturned a decision to cut
Texaco's bond to one billion dlrs, and sent the issue back to
the Texas courts.
    Analysts said the bankruptcy filing effectively froze all
Texaco's obligations while it continued to appeal the merits of
the Pennzoil lawsuit.
    "Attempts last week to win a compromise on both the bond
issue and the larger dispute failed," James Kinnear, Texaco's
president and chief executive officer, told reporters.
    Kinnear said Pennzoil's disclosure in court papers on
Friday that it wanted to extend the bond issue hearing until
the end of April, pushed Texaco further towards Chapter 11.
    Pennzoil had asked Texaco to post a 5.6 billion dlr cash
bond and to reduce its dividend to not more than 50 pct of
earnings. Pennzoil also wanted assurances that Texaco would not
sell any assets, Kinnear said.
    Texaco offered to put up one billion dlrs in a letter of
credit and agreed not to let the value of its assets fall under
11.1 billion dlrs, he added.
    Joseph Jamail, a Houston attorney for Pennzoil, said the
company had made its latest settlement offer to Texaco on
Saturday and was taken by surprise when Texaco filed for
bankruptcy.
    He declined to reveal the amount of the proposal, citing a
confidentiality agreement between the two companies. "Texaco
told us they would get back to us but instead they chose to go
to bankruptcy court," Jamail said.
    Attorneys for Pennzoil said they believed the company would
prevail in court appeals, adding that Texaco's assets were
ample ultimately to pay the Pennzoil judgment in full.

<TITLE>N.Z. PLANS EIGHT 250 MLN DLR 1987/88 BOND TENDERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Minister Roger Douglas said
eight bond tenders of 250 mln dlrs each are planned for the
year ending March 1988.
    Douglas said in a statement the June quarter borrowing
program will not include a May tender, but a 250 mln dlr tender
will be held on June 11.
    Overfunding in 1986/87 has removed the need for a May
tender, he said.
    Preliminary estimates put net public sector injections for
1987/88 year at 2.1 billion dlrs.
    The fiscal deficit for 1987/88 is forecast at 2.2 billion
dlrs compared with a forecast of 2.45 billion for 1986/87 and
1.87 billion a year earlier.
    However, Douglas said the 1987/88 estimate is subject to
uncertainties over the results of pre-budget spending reviews
and tax forecasts and over the effect the program of
"corporatising" certain government departments will have on
liquidity.
    Douglas said whatever the outcome of these influences the
net public sector injections will continue to be fully funded
on a fiscal year basis.

<TITLE>YUGOSLAV ECONOMY WORSENED IN 1986, BANK DATA SHOWS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BELGRADE, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>National Bank economic data for 1986
shows that Yugoslavia's trade deficit grew, the inflation rate
rose, wages were sharply higher, the money supply expanded and
the value of the dinar fell.
    The trade deficit for 1986 was 2.012 billion dlrs, 25.7 pct
higher than in 1985. The trend continued in the first three
months of this year as exports dropped by 17.8 pct, in hard
currency terms, to 2.124 billion dlrs.
    Yugoslavia this year started quoting trade figures in
dinars based on current exchange rates, instead of dollars
based on a fixed exchange rate of 264.53 dinars per dollar.
    Yugoslavia's balance of payments surplus with the
convertible currency area fell to 245 mln dlrs in 1986 from 344
mln in 1985. The National Bank said the drop was due to a
deterioration in trade. Exports to the convertible currency
area rose 11.6 pct from 1985, while imports rose 17.8 pct.
    Retail prices rose an average of 88.1 pct in 1986 while
industrial producer prices rose by 70.6 pct, the bank's data
showed. The cost of living rose by 89.1 pct.
    Personal incomes rose by 109 pct in 1986.
    Prime Minister Branko Mikulic warned in February that wages
were too high given the level of productivity.
    Mikulic introduced a law cutting wages to the level of the
last quarter of 1986 and tying future rises to productivity.
    Bank statistics show the overall 1986 rise in M-1 money
supply was 109.1 pct with a year-end position of 3,895.9
billion dinars. Yugoslavs have 9.8 billion dlrs worth of
foreign currency savings in the country and 20 billion dlrs
abroad, mostly owned by workers employed in western Europe.
    The dinar fell by 73.1 pct against a basket of hard
currencies in 1986. The highest depreciation was against the
Swiss franc, 85.3 pct, and the lowest against the U.S. Dollar,
46.2 pct.

Group Ltd &lt;ANZA.S> said it will make a one-for-two bonus issue
from its asset revaluation reserve to shareholders registered
June 2.
    The proposed bonus and an increase in authorised capital to
one billion one-dlr par shares from 600 mln will be put to
shareholders for approval at an extraordinary general meeting
on May 26, the ANZ said in a statement.
    The issue will absorb about 230 mln dlrs of the 260.9 mln
standing in the asset revaluation reserve, it said.
    The bank said that by lowering the dividend rate it expects
to maintain the value of dividend payout on the enlarged
capital at about the level of its last full year ended
September 30. The group paid 31 cents a share and 133.1 mln
dlrs in all for that year.
    Shareholders will also be asked to approve changes in the
bank's articles of association to allow it to offer shares in
lieu of the interim dividend at a discount of five pct to the
market price.
    The group is the latest to announce a tax-free bonus issue
ahead of dividend imputation, effective July 1.

<TITLE>GERMAN CAPITAL MARKET LIBERALIZATION STALLS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alice Ratcliffe, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>West Germany's capital market
liberalization program has stalled and bankers are worried it
may take years for further reforms to be completed.
    Liberalization got underway in May 1985 when foreign banks
received Bundesbank permission to lead-manage mark eurobonds.
    Further moves included introduction of mark-denominated
certificates of deposit last year. But other changes, including
revisions in the domestic options market and introduction of
futures contracts, need lengthy statutory changes and this may
take years, bankers and dealers say.
    Deutsche Bank AG co-chairman F. Wilhelm Christians called
last week for an enlargement of current capital market
instruments to include instruments already standard abroad.
    He said these are needed especially when prices fall,
citing declines in West German share prices in the first two
months of this year when stock indices fell about 20 pct.
    Others are more blunt. Securities dealers say the lack of
viable hedging instruments for shares and bonds makes trading
in domestic markets too risky.
    "We need a stock index futures contract, and a futures
contract for recent government bonds," one dealer said.
    West Germany now has options contracts on about five pct of
shares and bonds traded on exchanges here, covering only about
30 pct of the average traded volume, stock market sources said.
    Options can only be written on the original 14 bonds
selected when bond options were introduced last April. The most
recent bond on the list was issued in 1985.
    There are no futures exchanges in West Germany. German
banks may participate in futures exchanges through branches
abroad but these are at least outwardly subject to stringent
West German rules requiring that every contract be secured on a
one-by-one basis with a separate hedge, to prevent speculation.
    Another problem is a lack of liquidity in the existing
markets, owing to lack of private investor participation.
    Private individuals and corporations do not engage in
options trading now due to West Germany's civil and exchange
laws, which define losses made in futures and options business
as gambling losses, which investors need not pay back.
    Options business has been hurt by lack of liquidity from
pension funds, which currently are forbidden to invest in these
instruments. But they are to be allowed to enter the business
soon as the European Community begins to harmonize rules
governing funds.
    Manfred Laux, general secretary of the West German mutual
funds association in Frankfurt, said harmonized rules are to be
adopted by October 1, 1989 at the latest.
    The push to adopt new instruments has not been great in the
past, owing to wide-spread belief they are speculative, which
gives them a bad name in West Germany. But pressure for their
introduction here is growing.
    The start-up of a Swiss futures exchange has some bankers
considering if a similar exchange would be useful in West
Germany. They say that without innovations, some business could
drift to London, which the Bundesbank vehemently opposes.
    An official at the London International Financial Futures
Exchange (LIFFE) said the exchange currently has no plans to
introduce more mark-denominated contracts beyond the existing
mark-dollar contract. But he said the exchange is studying the
feasibility of other contracts, including one for three-month
mark interest rates and possibly a government bond contract.
    A Bundesbank capital markets expert said the Bundesbank has
no objections to hedging through futures but any liberalization
in that sector is still in the early planning stages after
earlier talks ended two years ago.
    Considerations about the futures business have been drawn
out because of the large number of participants involved in
talks. They include parliament, the Bundesbank, the Federal
Banking Supervisory Board, eight West German stock exchanges
and their governing states, and the four West German banking
associations.
    Beyond options and futures, other changes being suggested
include replacing the federal government's current bond
consortium with an auction procedure similar to one being
considered in the U.K. And already in practice in the U.S.
    This would upset the existing market order providing German
and foreign banks in the consortium with fixed quotas but it
would eliminate the misallocations some bankers say presently
arise within the fixed consortium quota system.
    In addition, some bankers would like the method of bond
trading on the West German stock exchange changed to a system
of continuous price-setting from the current system in which
every bond price is fixed once a day.
    This would make trading more transparent if it reduced the
proportion of off-floor interbank bond trading, now some 90 pct
of the volume of bond transactions here, the bankers say.

<TITLE>OFFER FOR DOME MAY SHORT-CIRCUIT ITS DEBT TALKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Larry Welsh, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>A 3.22 billion dlr offer for Dome
Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO>
may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the door
for more takeover bids, oil analysts said.
    Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt
of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim
debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer
substantial payments to creditors will expire.
    Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholders
that an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan.
    Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as
public noteholders in March after several months of delicate
negotiations.
    TransCanada's proposal "amounts to a quasi debt
restructuring," oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker
Ltd said from Toronto.
    Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allow
creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet
to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to
cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.
    "The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that
even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that
Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,"
said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in
Calgary.
    TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome
was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed
refinancing packages, Gobert said.
    The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome
since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders
to agree to a restructuring, he added.
    "I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain
any and all offers (for Dome)," Gobert said.
    Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that
TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix
the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other
possible buyers from making an offer. "By drawing attention to
us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little
reluctant to come forward," he said.
    Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal
offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a
confidential agreement between the two companies, he said.
    Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions
with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other
unidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and
financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including
TransCanada's.
    Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair price
for the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings.
    However, he said not enough financial details are known
about Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of
TransCanada's proposed offer.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>TEXACO &lt;TX> EUROBONDS UNQUOTED AT MARKET OPENING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Eurobonds for Texaco Inc subsidiaries
were unquoted this morning as traders assessed the implications
of the company's shock weekend decision to file for bankruptcy
under Chapter 11 of U.S. Bankruptcy laws, eurobond dealers
said.
    The decision to file for bankruptcy follows a court
decision that it had to post an 11 billion dlr bond to continue
its court battles with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL>.
    One head trader at a U.S. Securities house said, "I don't
want to be obstructive, but there genuinely is no market in
Texaco bonds at the moment. Everyone is stunned by the decision
(to file for bankruptcy) and can't really believe it."
    One dealer noted that Texaco subsidiaries have outstanding
eurobonds totalling over three billion dlrs out of total
borrowings of some 6.8 billion dlrs.
    He added that many of the fixed interest eurobonds - dollar
straights - had been trading "basis only" for some time prior to
this weekend's news. This means traders could quote a two way
price for the bonds but would not be bound to trade them. Any
trades would be negotiated.
    He said that recently there appeared to have been some
speculative buying of the bonds from the U.S. But that European
investors had been overall sellers.
    Dealers noted that under the Chapter 11 filing noteholders
will receive no interest payments.
    Texaco also has eurobonds outstanding which are convertible
into Texaco Inc common stock - known as convertibles. Trading
did not open in these issues either. One convertible dealer
said, "We're waiting to see the result of today's court hearing."
Texaco is applying today in the Texas courts for relief from
having to post the court bond.
    Texaco shares were being indicated by over the counter
share dealers here at around 26 to 28 dlrs compared with
Friday's close in New York of 31-7/8 dlrs.
    Pennzoil shares were indicated at 85 to 87 dlrs compared
with Friday's New York finish of 92-1/4 dlrs.

shortage of around 400 mln stg in the money market today.
    Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing
in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain
some 1.085 billion stg.
    Partly offsetting these outflows, a fall in note
circulation will add some 340 mln stg, exchequer transactions
around 300 mln and bankers' balances above target about 50 mln.

<TITLE>TRADE ISSUES STRAINING EC'S PATIENCE WITH JAPAN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Gerrard Raven, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Member states of the European
Community are starting to run out of patience with Japan which
they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open
its market to imports, but as often made only minor moves.
    Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC
countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the
willingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanese
government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC.
    However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, as
EC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan.
    Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to
an EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could
raise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S.
Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17.
    The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligations
entered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designed
to stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of
the U.S.
    The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC's
trade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs in
March, up from 1.94 billion in February.
    In 1986, Japanese exports to the EC totalled 30.67 billion
dlrs, up 4.5 pct from 1985, while EC exports to Japan fell one
pct to 12.43 billion dlrs.
    In Paris, trade minister Michel Noir said France has
decided to give Japan a taste of its own medicine.
    Burgeoning imports of microwave ovens and of frozen
Coquilles St Jacques will be restricted by a strict application
of French quality standards -- something EC states say often
happens to their own exports entering Japan.
    Britain has threatened to withdraw the licences of Japanese
banks and insurance companies to operate in the City of London,
because the British Cable and Wireless company lost out in
competition for a Japanese telecommucations contract.
    However, British officials in London have said that the
government may have gone too far in implying that it would take
immediate drastic action unless the contract was reopened.
    By contrast, West Germany, with the EC's most successful
economy, has never threatened Tokyo with sanctions, preferring
to rely on firm diplomacy and encouragement of its own
industries to surmount obstacles to export to Japan.
    The EC Commission itself has switched its tactics in recent
years, substituting general calls for action by Japan to open
its market with specific demands for moves in key areas.
    At present, it is, for instance, pressuring Japan to end
allegedly discriminatory taxation of imported wines and
spirits, to ensure EC companies have a chance to win contracts
for the building of a new international airport, and to
simplify certification and safety checks on imported cars.
    EC officials say these tactics yield some benefits, but
often the Japanese announce modifications of their non-tariff
barriers which open the door to imports by only a token amount.
    They stress, however, that any action must be taken by the
EC as a whole to stop beggar-my-neighbour action.
    One of the problems Britain could face if it were to
withdraw licences for Japanese banks would be that the bankers
would be welcomed with open arms in Frankfurt or Amsterdam,
they point out.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Morgan Crucible Co Plc &lt;MGCR.L> said the
prospects for 1987 were encouraging, with orders and sales
significantly up on last year in all divisions.
    It said there were good opportunities for growth in both
existing and recently acquired businesses as well as for growth
by acquisition in related areas.
    It earlier announced a 6.1 mln stg rise in pre-tax profit
to 24.8 mln stg for the year to December 28. Turnover rose to
242.1 mln from 211.5 mln.
    Most of its companies performed well despite a slowdown in
the U.S., U.K. And Australian economies in the first half.
    Currency fluctuations reduced pretax profit by around one
mln stg, it noted.
    Morgan said although profits in the electronics sector
improved to 1.0 mln stg from 100,000 stg previously, results
were nonetheless disappointing.
    Sales were lower than expected, due mainly to delayed
defence orders and cancellations. However, it said it had taken
the necessary remedial action, obtained new business and was
now proceeding with the delivery of major delayed orders.
    Morgan shares firmed two pence to 318p at 0905 GMT from
316p at Friday's close.

<TITLE>AWB CHAIRMAN URGES FARMERS NOT TO CUT PLANTINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MELBOURNE, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Australia could lose valuable wheat
markets through lack of availability if plantings for the
coming 1987/88 season are significantly reduced, Australian
Wheat Board (AWB) chairman Clinton Condon said.
    "If predictions of a 30 pct decrease in plantings prove
true, Australia may not be able to supply wheat to some of its
valuable markets," he said in a statement.
    Condon did not say who had made the predictions, but an AWB
spokesman said there was a general industry feeling that
farmers, hard hit by low prices and rising costs, could cut
back plantings sharply. Wheat sowing normally begins in May.
    However, Condon said he did not believe plantings would be
cut by as much as 30 pct although he realised many farmers were
facing enormous financial pressures.
    He said the AWB expects the area sown to be about 10.7 mln
hectares, down from 11.3 mln in 1986/87 when the crop was about
16 mln tonnes. Final crop estimates for 1986/87 and planting
intentions for 1987/88 are not yet available.
    If the AWB is unable, because of a short-term cut in
plantings, to meet the needs of the markets it has developed
with much time and effort, it may have great difficulty selling
wheat to those markets in the future, Condon said.
    "Markets which rely on a steady supply of Australian wheat
understand a decrease in production due to drought but they
will have difficulty understanding a deliberate decision to
decrease production," Condon said.
    "If Australia wants wheat to continue as a major export
income earner, governments and government authorities will need
to closely examine ways of contributing to the continuing
viability of the wheat industry," he added.
    Australia's leading wheat markets include China, Egypt,
Iran, Iraq, the Soviet Union and Japan.

<TITLE>DUTCH FEED COMPOUNDER STARTS CASE AGAINST EC LEVY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROTTERDAM, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>A major animal feed producer, Cehave
NV Veghel (CHV), has begun legal proceedings against the
application of the European Community grain co-responsibility
levy, with the full backing of the Dutch animal grain and feed
trade association, Het Comite, association chief executive
Peter Pex told Reuters.
    Oral proceedings were held in the Hague on Friday and the
court said it would give its verdict within six weeks. "However,
that is the normal wording and we expect the Hague court to
refer questions on the interpretation and application of the
levy to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg," Pex added.
    Het Comite claims the way the levy is applied does not take
account of currency cross-rates of exchange and can mean a
compounder in one country being asked to pay a higher levy in
its own national currency than it received down the chain from
the original producer of the grain.
    "We would like the Business Administration Court in the
Hague to ask the Luxembourg Court of Justice not only whether
the Dutch Grain Commodity Board, the levy collection agency,
has interpreted the levy regulations correctly, but also
whether the regulations themselves may contravene European law,"
Pex said.
    "It is only with great regret that we have taken this route,
but we have had no political help, and therefore have no option
even though it could take years," Pex added.
    Het Comite asked CHV to act as a test case against the
grain levy because the bill the company received from the
commodity board included grain from a wide variety of origins
and was therefore considered to be the best general basis for a
legal challenge to the levy, Pex noted.
    Het Comite's actions will run in tandem with questions on
the levy already posed to the Luxembourg Court in a case
brought by the Association of European Animal Feed
Manufacturers, FEFAC.

<DATELINE>    PEKING, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>China has raised the state purchase
prices of corn, rice, cottonseed and shelled peanuts from April
1 to encourage farmers to grow them, the official China
Commercial Daily said.
    The paper said the price paid for corn from 14 northern
provinces, cities and regions has increased by one yuan per 50
kg. A foreign agricultural expert said the rise will take the
price to 17 fen per jin (0.5 kg) from 16 fen.
    The paper said the price for long-grained rice from 10
southern provinces and cities was raised by 1.5 yuan per 50 kg.
    The paper said the price for round-grained rice from 11
provinces, regions and cities in central, east and northwest
China has been increased by 1.75 yuan per 50 kg. It gave no
more price details.
    It said local authorities must inform farmers of the price
increases before farmers begin planting, to encourage
production of grains and oilseeds.
    Chinese officials have said farmers are unwilling to grow
grain because they can earn more from other crops.

grindings, which rose 2.9 pct from the same 1986 quarter, were

    They described the results, announced Saturday, as normal

quarter was rather high and some was carried over into the
first quarter.
    Grindings rose to 55,190 tonnes from 53,643 in the first

Association said that West German grindings are expected to
stay relatively high in comparison to other West European

<TITLE>EURO-MEDIUM TERM NOTES POISED FOR GROWTH</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Marguerite Nugent, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Euro-medium term notes, a recent
phenomenon in the international capital markets, are hardly
attracting a flood of issuers but investment bankers are doing
their best to breath life into the market.
    Medium term notes (MTNs) have met with staggering success
in the U.S. Market where total outstandings have grown to
around 50 billion dlrs since 1983, the year they took hold as a
new financing vehicle to bridge the gap between commercial
paper and longer term bonds. Convinced they are here to stay,
investment bankers are attempting to adapt MTNs for the
euromarket.
    Ralph Bunche, a vice president of Morgan Stanley
International, predicted at a recent Euromoney conference on
MTNs here that they will become the predominant instrument for
raising funds in the late 1980's and 1990's. "It (the MTN
market) will even surpass the bond market," he said.
    Other bankers took exception with the degree to which MTNs
will grow. But they generally agreed that these instruments
provide the borrower with greater flexibility and lower costs
than a traditional bond.
    The trick is in convincing European borrowers it is worth
arranging a program and, having accomplished that, to persaude
European investors -- whose preferences differ from their U.S.
Counterparts -- to buy the securities.
    Discussions with bankers proved one thing. No one is
exactly sure how to proceed with structuring and marketing
these issues.
    To date only 13 Euro-MTN programs have been announced but
only a few have been activated, such as those for a unit of
PepsiCo Inc and another for AB Electrolux.
    Several firms have devised different structures for
Euro-MTNs and defend their structures adamantly.
    The PepsiCo notes, for example, are sold on a continuously
offered basis. This involves a small amount of new notes with
similar maturities constantly on offer at current market rates.
    The Electrolux program uses multi-tranche tap notes devised
by Merrill Lynch. Under this structure, an initial tranche of a
minimum 50 mln dlrs has a fixed rate of interest and maturity.
The borrower then issues additional notes in this category up
to a pre-determined maximum.
    Those who defend the continuously offered method, such as
Wendy Dietze, a Salomon Brothers Inc vice president, point to
the flexibility they offer in interest rate and maturity.
    Furthermore, she believes this structure offers the
European investor greater confidence in market liquidity -- a
major concern for these buyers.
    Merrill Lynch Europe Ltd's Kevin Regan defends the
medium-tranche tap notes concept saying it offers comparable
liquidity. But he also said that this structure may not be the
right option for all borrowers.
    Peter Mortimer, a partner in the law firm Milbank, Tweed,
Hadley and McCloy, noted that legal requirements could well
determine which structure is chosen.
    He noted that the tap system allows a more clearly defined
"lock-up" period as each tranche has a specific maturity. In the
case of notes issued by U.S. Borrowers, the "lock-up" period is
the 90 days after the completion of a series during which time
a security cannot be sold back to the U.S. Or to U.S.
Investors.
    However, he said that the Securities and Exchange
Commission is reviewing its current regulations on the
ownership of foreign securities by U.S. Citizens and that some
softening in the rules could come in the not too distant
future.
    For their part borrowers say they feel a bit like guinea
pigs.
    Petter Skouen, executive vice president of the Nordic
Investment Bank (NIB), noted that a few weeks ago NIB would
have said it was disappointed with its Euro-MTN program, but
that the success of a recent issue changed their minds.
    He conceded that in retrospect it would have been wiser to
establish separate programs for the euromarket and the U.S.
Domestic market, rather than try to extend the U.S. Issue
globally. Under NIB's 200 mln dlr program, 100 mln has been
sold in the U.S. And 25 mln in Europe.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>INSTITUTES DIVIDED ON OUTLOOK FOR GERMAN ECONOMY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The five leading West German economic
research institutes have failed to agree about how strongly the
domestic economy will expand this year but revised down
forecasts contained in a report published six months ago.
    The three research groups of Kiel, Hamburg and Essen
predicted in the institutes' joint spring report that gross
national product (GNP) would rise by two pct in 1987, compared
with 2.4 pct in 1986. The five institutes had jointly forecast
three pct 1987 growth in October last year.
    Taking a dissenting view, the DIW institute of West Berlin
and Munich's Ifo institute predicted only one pct 1987 growth.
    The joint report said that the estimates of economic
development made by the DIW and Ifo were "markedly less
favourable" than those of the other three.
    The DIW and Ifo forecast the economy would pick up after a
slow start to the year. "In the second half of 1987 there will,
however, only be a weak upward movement," they said.
    The two institutes said external economic factors which
were currently damaging exports and pushing up imports would
dominate the economic environment throughout the year. They saw
exports falling by a real 2-1/2 pct in 1987 and predicted no
marked improvement in the course of the year.
    The other three institutes, however, wrote: "The decline in
demand and production (seen) in the winter months does not
indicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing."
    They said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporate
uncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans.
But they expected that many investments had not been cancelled
but only put off. "It can be presumed that the braking actions
(on the economy) will diminish markedly this year."
    They added: "The domestic prerequisites for a continuation
of the economic uptrend are still favourable."
    These three institutes said diminishing external burdens
combined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn in
demand and production could be expected by the spring.
    However, this projection was clouded by risks including the
further development of the mark against the dollar.
    Contrary to the DIW and Ifo, the three institutes said that
while exports would continue to be the weak point of the
economy in 1987, "there is good reason to believe that exports
will soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge during
the course of the year." They predicted an overall 0.5 pct fall
in exports in 1987, the same as in 1986.
    The three more positive institutes saw private consumption
rising by four pct in 1987, compared with 4.2 pct in 1986,
while DIW and Ifo predicted a three pct increase.
    They saw the climate for equipment investment improving but
predicted only a rise of four pct in 1987 against 4.6 pct in
1986. Ifo and DIW saw these investments rising by only two pct.
    All the institutes predicted only a slight decline in
unemployment. The Kiel, Hamburg and Essen institutes said the
jobless total would average 2.17 mln in 1987 compared with 2.23
mln in 1986 and predicted a rise in the number of people in
work of about 200,000.
    These three institutes said new jobs would be created
mainly in the private services sector and also by the state in
the context of job creation measures. The construction industry
was likely to engage new workers for the first time since 1980
but they predicted either no rise in employment in the
manufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion.
    The DIW and Ifo said rises in employment would occur only
in the tertiary sector, while "the number employed in the
manufacturing industry will decline."
    The DIW and Ifo said unemployment would only decline to
2.20 mln in 1987 from 2.23 mln in 1986.
    They saw the current account surplus falling in 1987 to 58
billion marks from 78 billion in 1986. The other three saw a
current account surplus in 1987 of at least 60 billion marks
and predicted that the trade surplus would fall to only around
100 billion marks from 112 billion in 1986.
    The institutes agreed that consumer prices would start to
rise in 1987, after they declined in 1986, and all five
predicted an average increase over the year of 0.5 pct.

<TITLE>SAUDI RIYAL DEPOSITS SURGE ON U.S. RATE RISE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Saudi riyal interbank deposit rates
surged across the board as banks tried to build long positions
in anticipation of a further rise in U.S. Interest rates,
dealers said.
    They said traders expected riyal deposits to follow the
recent strong rise in eurodollar rates sparked by fears of a
tighter U.S. Monetary policy to halt the dollar's slide.
    "There was a wave of panic buying early in the morning as
people tried to cover gaps and build long riyal positions," said
one dealer. As a result, riyal deposits were strongly bid and
traders scrambled for any available offers.
    One-way trade focused mainly on the fixed periods but short
dates also rose, dealers said. Spot-next and one-week deposits
climbed to 6-5/8, 1/8 pct from 6-3/8, six on Sunday.
    One-month deposits rose to 6-1/2, 3/8 pct from 6-1/4, six
and three-month deposits climbed to 6-3/4, 5/8 pct from 6-9/16,
7/16. Six-month deposits also firmed to 7-1/8, seven pct from
7-1/16, 6-7/8 on Sunday.
    The spot riyal was steady at 3.7500/03 to the dollar after
quotes of 3.7498/7503 yesterday.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Gold bullion continued to move higher
supported by good general buying and was fixed this morning at
436.50 dlrs, 268.368 stg, an ounce, up from Friday's close of
432.00/50, dealers said.
    The setting was the highest since October 8 as gold built
on Friday's gains, which had been based on the weakness of the
dollar and fears of a trade war between the United States and
Japan.
    It opened slightly firmer at 433.50/434.00 and moved up
steadily during the morning supported by commission house and
trade buying, dealers said.
    Dealers said there was resistance around 440.00 but with
sentiment still firm some traders believe the rally may even
take gold as high as 500 dlrs.
    Platinum was fixed this morning at 583.50 dlrs an ounce, up
from Friday's close of 578.50/580.50, and also the highest
setting since October.

<TITLE>BORG-WARNER AGREES TO BUYOUT BY MERRILL LYNCH FIRM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Borg-Warner &lt;BOR> Corp, facing an
unwanted offer from GAF Corp &lt;GAF>, agreed to a 4.23 billion
dlr buyout offer from a company to be formed by &lt;Merrill Lynch
Capital Partners Inc>.
    Borg-Warner and Merrill said yesterday they entered a
definitive merger agreement, under which a subsidiary of the
new company, &lt;AV Holdings Corp>, will begin a 48.50 dlr per
share cash tender offer today for 77.6 mln shares or 89 pct of
Borg-Warner common stock.
    The offer will be followed by a merger in which each
remaining share will be converted into 19.75 dlrs cash and
54.25 dlrs principal amount of AV Holdings junior subordinated
discount debentures.
    As a result of the merger, Borg-Warner will become a wholly
owned subsidiary of AV Holdings. A Borg-Warner spokeswoman said
members of management do not plan to participate in the
transaction, but they will retain their positions with the
company.
    A spokesman for GAF was unavailable for comment. GAF holds
19.9 pct of Borg-Warner's shares.
    GAF had said it would offer 46 dlrs per share.
    Borg-Warner's spokeswoman said the company still plans to
sell its financial services unit, which includes Wells Fargo
security guards, and the Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.
    Borg-Warner has been the focus of takeover speculation for
about a year. Corporate raider Irwin Jacobs last year proposed
a takeover of the firm and until recently held 10 pct of the
stock. Following the GAF offer, analysts had calculated breakup
values for the company in the low 50 dlrs per share range and
speculated an offer would have to be sweetened.
    In its statement, Borg-Warner said its board endorsed the
Merrill offer and it recommended that shareholders tender their
shares. The board received opinions on the offer from its
advisors, First Boston Corp and Goldman, Sachs and Co.
    James Burke, president of Merrill Lynch Capital Partners,
said, "We are very pleased to have entered into this transaction
with Borg-Warner. We are looking forward to working with the
employees of Borg-Warner and to Borg-Warner maintaining its
strong presence in the Chicago community."
    Merrill Lynch will be the dealer-manager for the offer,
which expires at midnight EDT May 8 (0400 GMT, May 9), subject
to conditions, including the completion of necessary financing
arrangements.
    The offer is also subject to a minimum 44.25 mln shares, or
51 pct of the outstanding shares, being tendered.
    Merrill Lynch and certain affiliates have committed to
provide 200 mln dlrs in AV Holdings equity and 870 mln in
subordinated financing and forward underwriting commitments.
    Merrill Lynch said that following discussions with
commercial banks it is confident it can obtain the rest of the
financing required to complete the transaction.
    The junior subordinated discount debentures to be issued in
the merger will carry a 13 pct coupon and will begin paying
cash interest after five years.
    The debentures will be redeemable at the company's option
for the first six years at 105 pct, during the seventh year at
102.5 pct and after that at 100 pct of the principal amount.
    The junior subordinated discount debentures have a maturity
of 20 years and are entitled to a sinking fund commencing in
the 16th year designed to retire 60 pct of the issue before
maturity.
    Borg-Warner will also redeem all of its outstanding 4.50
dlrs cumulative preferred stock, series A, for 100 dlrs per
share. Holders who wish to participate in the offer must first
convert their preferred stock into Borg-Warner common stock.
    The board of Borg-Warner has also taken steps to redeem its
poison pill or share purchase rights for five cents per right,
effective immediately.

<TITLE>U.K. MARCH PRODUCER PRICES RISE 0.3 PCT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The price index for sales of
manufactured goods in the U.K. Rose a provisional, unadjusted
0.3 pct in March after an identical rise in February,
Department of Trade and Industry figures show.
    The index for materials and fuel purchased by manufacturing
industry fell a provisional and unadjusted 1.1 pct after a 1.7
pct fall in February.
    The Department said the year-on-year rise in producer
prices in March was a provisional 3.7 pct, compared with a
provisional 4.2 pct increase in the year to end-February.
    The index for output prices, non-seasonally adjusted, was
put at a provisional 149.7 in March after 149.3 in February.
    The index for input prices, also not seasonally adjusted,
was set at 128.2 in March after February's 129.6.
    The 1.1 pct fall in input prices between February and March
was mainly due to a seasonal fall in industrial electricity
costs and lower scheduled prices for petroleum products, the
Department said.
    The Department said these falls were only partly offset by
a rise in prices of home-produced food manufacturing materials.
    The seasonally adjusted index for input prices showed a 0.2
pct rise between February and March.
    Year-on-year, the input price index was down 0.7 pct in
March after a 2.8 pct drop in February.

<TITLE>STATOIL SEEKS SHARE IN THAI GAS FIELD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STAVANGER, Norway, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Norway's state oil company
Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil) &lt;STAT.OL>, has told
Thai authorities it is interested in taking a 30 pct share in a
big offshore Thailand gas field, Statoil said.
    The field, in the southern sector of the Gulf of Thailand,
is currently operated by U.S. Oil company Texas Pacific Oil Co
Inc, a unit of Canada's Seagram Co Ltd &lt;VO.N>. Thailand's state
oil company &lt;Petroleum Authority Thailand> (PTT) also holds a
major stake in the field.
    PTT wants to develop the field and has asked Statoil to
consider co-development if the field's licence is renewed.
    PTT, according to Statoil, is currently negotiating with
Texas Pacific to buy back the Dallas-based oil company's
holdings in the field.
    "PTT must first sort out its problems with Texas Pacific.
When this is done, we have said we are interested in taking
over a 30 pct share in the field," Statoil spokesman Willy Olsen
told Reuters.
    Statoil, hired by PTT to carry out an independent appraisal
of the field's reserves and propose a development plan, has
estimated the field could be commercially developed at a cost
of some 700 mln crowns.
    Industry sources said Texas Pacific has submitted lower
reserve estimates for the field than Statoil and shown little
interest in its development. Statoil refused to disclose its
upgraded reserve estimate for the field.
    The field's reserves could be sold domestically through
Thailand's gas distribution network or by converting the gas to
electricity, the sources said.
    Sources would not say which field Statoil is considering.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>WEST GERMAN INSTITUTES CALL FOR EARLY TAX CUTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The five leading West German economic
research institutes said the government should do more to
stimulate economic growth and called for early introduction of
tax cuts planned for 1990.
    In their joint spring report the institutes were divided
about 1987 growth forecasts, with three predicting two pct
expansion and the other two only one pct growth. Gross national
product grew 2.4 pct last year.
    But the report said all the institutes believed that "more
must be done to produce dynamic growth so that more additional
jobs can be created."
    The institutes said any step which improved basic economic
conditions should be taken as quickly as possible. "From this
point of view, the tax reform planned for 1990 should be
brought forward."
    The government plans gross tax reductions of 44 billion
marks as part of the major tax reform. The net tax relief from
the tax reform will amount to 25 billion marks.
    However, the institutes criticised the government, not only
for the timing of the reform, but also because the question of
its financing had been left open.
    The government has not specified how the remaining 19
billion marks of the tax reduction package will be paid for,
though it has said it wants to cut state subsidies.
    The institutes said this lack of clarity from Bonn had
caused uncertainty among companies and households as to what
exactly they would receive from the tax reform and urged a
quick decision from the government.
    They also said the government should reduce tax
preferences, which would simplify the fiscal system, urged a
restriction of state spending and called for no increase in
value-added tax.
    The institutes also criticised Bonn for increasing
subsidies at a time further reductions had been pledged.
    They referred specifically to a doubling of special
writedowns for small and medium sized companies announced in a
package of tax adjustments planned for 1988 and described this
as an increase in subsidies.
    The institutes said total subsidies, including tax
preferences, had reached 80 billion marks in 1985 and risen
further since then. Given the scope of these subsidies, it
should be possible "despite ... Major political difficulties" to
finance the tax reform by cutting state handouts.
    The institutes said that if the government raised value
added tax or other indirect taxes a large portion of the
positive effects resulting from lower taxes would be lost.
    The report also noted that the government was progressing
only slowly with its plans to privatise state companies and
said more deregulation was needed. The government had to aim
for more competition, it said.

&lt;CP.N> and British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L>.
    Along with the TransCanada offer, Dome has had another
proposal from "a substantial company" and discussions with a
third company which could lead to an offer, Dome said in a
statement.
    The statement confirmed Dome received TransCanada's bid,
but did not identify the companies involved in talks.
    TransCanada, Canada's largest natural gas pipeline
operator, said it is offering Dome a package of cash, common
and preferred shares, and shares in a new subsidiary which
would own and operate Dome's assets. TransCanada said the offer
is to Dome management, not to shareholders.
    Dome has massive oil and gas landholdings in Canada,
totalling 36.1 mln acres of which 7.4 mln have been developed.
It also has tax credits worth about 2.5 billion dlrs.
    Dome's statement said the TransCanada announcement "violated
the terms and spirit of a confidentiality agreement entered
into with prospective purchasers" and was apparently timed to
prevent Dome from considering other proposals.
    It said the TransCanada bid "seems to require favourable and
substantial taxation concessions from the federal and
provincial governments." But Dome added that its management and
financial advisers will evaluate all proposals.
    TransCanada chief financial officer H. Neil Nichols said he
was surprised at the vehemence of Dome's statement and denied
that TransCanada was trying to usurp other bids. "I find (Dome's
statement) very bothersome. Once the board made the decision to
authorise the proposal, it had a legal obligation to announce
it," he said. Nichols said he did not know the identity of the
other bidders, or the terms of other offers.
    Dome common shares closed at 1.13 dlrs on Friday on the
Toronto Stock Exchange. The preferred class A stock closed at
5.00 dlrs. Common stock traded as high as 25.00 dlrs in 1981.

<TITLE>BANK OF JAPAN TO SELL 800 BILLION YEN IN BILLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Japan will sell 800 billion
yen in deficit financing bills today through 51-day repurchase
agreements maturing June 3 to help absorb a projected money
market surplus, money traders said.
    The operation will raise the outstanding supply of the
bills to a record 4,800 billion yen.
    The yield on the bills for sale to banks and securities
houses from money houses will be 3.8999 pct compared with the
two-month commercial bill discount rate today of 3.8750 pct and
the two-month certificate of deposit rate of 4.13/00 pct.
    The traders estimated the surplus today at about 1,800
billion yen.
    They said it is mainly due to 1,300 billion yen of
government tax allocations to local governments and public
entities and to excessive banking system cash holdings due to
continuous large central bank dollar purchases.

<TITLE>LME CLARIFIES NEW ALUMINIUM CONTRACT DETAILS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The London Metal Exchange (LME) has
issued a note clarifying details on its new high grade
aluminium contract, in response to questions from members
following the announcement of the contract, due to start June
1.
 All deliverable shapes of aluminium under the high grade
primary aluminium contract (minimum 99.7 pct purity) will also
be deliverable against the standard primary aluminium contract
(min 99.5 pct), the LME said.
    Sows will not constitute good delivery against the standard
contract until September 1, and 99.5 pct purity sows are not
good delivery and cannot be placed on LME warrant.
    The dollar quotation for the high grade contract will be in
multiples of one U.S. Dollar but carries may be made at 50
cents for even tonnages only.
    Singapore, which is the first port warehouse outside Europe
to be used as an LME delivery point, will be used for high
grade metal only and the rent imposed by owners Steinweg will
be 1.05 U.S. Dlr a tonne per week, the LME said.
    The LME Board, in response to representation from the
trade, agreed to annul from LME contracts the minimum weight
requirements of 450 kilos for T-bars and 250 kilos for sows,
effective for high grade on June 1 and for standard on July 24.

<TITLE>TEXACO &lt;TX> EUROBONDS UNQUOTED AT MARKET OPENING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Eurobonds for Texaco Inc subsidiaries
were unquoted this morning as traders assessed the implications
of the company's shock weekend decision to file for bankruptcy
under Chapter 11 of U.S. Bankruptcy laws, eurobond dealers
said.
    The decision to file for bankruptcy follows a court
decision that it had to post an 11 billion dlr bond to continue
its court battles with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL>.
    One head trader at a U.S. Securities house said, "I don't
want to be obstructive, but there genuinely is no market in
Texaco bonds at the moment. Everyone is stunned by the decision
(to file for bankruptcy) and can't really believe it."
    One dealer noted that Texaco subsidiaries have outstanding
eurobonds totalling over three billion dlrs out of total
borrowings of some 6.8 billion dlrs.
    He added that many of the fixed interest eurobonds - dollar
straights - had been trading "basis only" for some time prior to
this weekend's news. This means traders could quote a two way
price for the bonds but would not be bound to trade them. Any
trades would be negotiated.
    He said that recently there appeared to have been some
speculative buying of the bonds from the U.S. But that European
investors had been overall sellers.
    Dealers noted that under the Chapter 11 filing noteholders
will receive no interest payments.
    Texaco also has eurobonds outstanding which are convertible
into Texaco Inc common stock - known as convertibles. Trading
did not open in these issues either. One convertible dealer
said, "We're waiting to see the result of today's court hearing."
Texaco is applying today in the Texas courts for relief from
having to post the court bond.
    Texaco shares were being indicated by over the counter
share dealers here at around 26 to 28 dlrs compared with
Friday's close in New York of 31-7/8 dlrs.
    Pennzoil shares were indicated at 85 to 87 dlrs compared
with Friday's New York finish of 92-1/4 dlrs.

<TITLE>CURRENCY MOVES MAY BE HURTING WORLD TRADE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Eric Hall, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese trade figures are seriously
challenging the entrenched view of policy makers of the Group
of Seven industrialised nations that relative currency rates
are the key to smoothing world trade problems.
    Senior Japanese, U.S. And European officials in Tokyo say
they are at a loss to fully explain the data, for if currencies
are the key they ask, why then are are U.S. Exports to Japan
shrinking?
    What if manipulating currencies and driving the dollar down
made world trade problems worse rather than solving them,
fulfilling Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's forecast of
world trade recession?
    U.S.-Japan trade has declined even after a 40 pct dollar
fall against the yen since the September 1985 Group of Five
pact in New York.
    The lower dollar ought to have made U.S. Exports 40 pct
more competitive in Japan. The officials, most of them
economists, can offer no objective reason why they are not.
    Worse, how are European Community sales to Japan rising
rapidly when the European Currency Unit has until now declined
only 11 pct against the yen.?
    Last week's G-7 meeting in Washington has been widely
interpreted as a sign from the policy makers that the dollar
must go lower. So worst of all, what if Volcker is correct?
    At a loss to give an objective explanation, officials can
only offer explanations which tend to be highly subjective.
    "I don't know and I don't think anyone knows," said Hugh
Richardson, acting head of the EC delegation in Tokyo.
    "What I do know is that Community exporters are making a
hell of an effort in this market. If you make an effort, there
is money to be made in Japan," he added.
    But U.S. Officials and businessmen are convinced low U.S.
Exports to Japan are Japan's fault. They cite restrictive trade
practices, protected Japanese trade sectors, such as
agriculture, and non-tariff barriers, such as unreasonable
checking and customs procedures for car imports.
    Publicly, Japanese officials remain conciliatory in the
face of what they see as U.S. Aggression. In private, they
blame U.S. Industry for being uncompetitive.
    "We see it that way, but we don't like to seem arrogant,"
said a senior official, who declined to be named. "We like to
refrain from accusing them of not making enough effort."
    Industrialists such as Eishiro Saito, chairman of the
Keidanren business group, and Sony Corp chairman Akio Morita
repeatedly accuse foreign firms of not making enough effort to
understand Japan's markets, and some foreigners agree. "The real
issue is the inability of major sectors of American and
European industry to compete not only internationally but even
in their home markets," Peter Huggler, President of Interallianz
Bank Zurich, told a recent conference in Switzerland.

<TITLE>U.K. PRODUCER PRICES SEEN MOVED BY TECHNICALITIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.K. Producer price data for March were
roughly as expected after taking into account technical factors
which affected the year-on-year outcome, economic analysts
said.
    The figures showed a 0.3 pct provisional, non-seasonally
adjusted rise in output prices in March, unchanged from
February and close to the average for the last six months.
    The year-on-year rise was put at 3.7 pct, down from 4.2 pct
in February.
    But Chris Tinker, economist at brokerage house Phillips and
Drew, said the drop in the year-on-year rate mainly reflected a
rise in excise duties which affected the index in March last
year.
    He cautioned that it was dangerous to read too much into
the monthly figure, adding that a rise of only 0.2 pct in April
would take the year-on-year rise back above 4.2 pct.
    Analysts also noted that a drop in manufacturers' input
prices was almost entirely due to anticipated seasonal factors
such as a fall in industrial electricity costs.
    Duncan Squire of Lloyds Merchant Bank said the figures were
slightly disappointing in that the strengthening of sterling
had not yet reduced input prices as much as expected.
    Both he and Tinker said this factor should help keep input
costs down over the next few months, although Tinker added that
last year's fall in oil prices is now about to drop out of the
year-on-year comparisons and is likely to lead to a return to
rises in the index rather than falls.

<TITLE>BANGEMANN REJECTS CALL FOR EARLY TAX CUTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German Economics Minister Martin
Bangemann indirectly rejected a call from the country's leading
economic research institutes for early introduction of a major
tax reform involving gross tax cuts of 44 billion marks.
    In a statement reacting to the five institutes' joint
spring report, Bangemann said that as far as the call for
bringing forward the 1990 tax reform was concerned --
    "The government points out that the positive effects for
growth of its policy of consolidation (cutting the budget
deficit) must not be allowed to be endangered."
    Bangemann also recalled that the scope of tax cuts planned
for 1988 had already been increased.
    Three institutes predicted two pct economic growth in 1987,
with exports falling by 0.5 pct. The other two saw only one pct
growth and said exports would fall 2.5 pct.
    Bangemann said "The government, agreeing with the majority,
sees no reason for the extraordinarily pessimistic estimate for
exports expressed by the minority."
    He said there was reason to believe that export demand
would start to rise in the course of the year, partly because
of a further increase in world trade.

compared with the same period in 1985, National Statistics
Institute ISTAT said.
    ISTAT said in a statement that GDP growth in fourth quarter

real terms from 1985.
    Imports in the fourth quarter totalled 26,361 billion lire,
down 1.4 pct from the 1985 fourth quarter and down 6.6 pct from
the third 1986 quarter, ISTAT said.
    Istat said exports totaled 23,190 billion lire in the
fourth quarter, down 4.1 pct from the comparable 1985 quarter
and down 6.7 pct from the third quarter in 1986.
    Fixed investments were 23,438 billion lire in the fourth
quarter, down 0.7 pct from the preceding quarter and up 1.1 pct
from the comparable 1985 quarter.

<TITLE>G-7 SEEMS WORRIED MARKETS IGNORE COORDINATION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Torday, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Top officials of leading industrial
nations appear deeply worried that financial markets have
ignored their efforts to coordinate policies, which they
believe they strengthened in talks last week.
    Monetary sources said officials were exasperated that the
markets, which drove the dollar rapidly lower and severely
disrupted bond and stock markets too, did not take heed of the
policy commitments of the Group of Seven -- the United States,
Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.
    Treasury Secretary James Baker went out of his way to
reassure markets of his commitment to a stable dollar with a
statement, and French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur
underscored that by saying: "I don't believe at all that the
Americans want a weaker dollar."
    West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the
dollar's latest rapid descent "involves the risk -- now already
a tangible threat -- of a new strong surge of inflation,
leading to a renewed rise in interest rates."
    But there were signs too, that while policymakers feared
the market uproar, they seemed to accept there was little they
could do until the economic picture changed, and currencies
settled into a stable pattern as a result.
    Nor did there seem to be any enthusiasm at last week's
semi-annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank for higher
U.S. Interest rates as the best way to curb the dollar's rapid
descent. That distaste stems in part from fears of recession.
    Outgoing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman told
television interviewers he did not think a policy of driving
the dollar down would solve the U.S. trade deficit.
    "It would slow growth in Germany and Japan which would
adversely affect our trade balance and ultimately it would
drive interest rates up here which would throw us, if not
(into) recession, into slower growth," he said.
    Asked if higher U.S. Interest rates would stabilize the
dollar, Balladur said: "When a currency is maintained
artificially high, by artificially high interest rates, it is
not healthy."
    And resorting to higher interest rates could lead to
recession, he said.
    Acknowledging the dollar's latest slide was now a fact of
life, Balladur said, "there may be adjustments of course in one
or other currencies, this is not a fixed rate system."
    But Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker said he
might rein in credit if the dollar's slide deepens.
    U.S. Monetary sources also said Washington wanted it
understood by markets the seven's commitments were genuine.
    "The United States and the six major industrial countries
are fully committed to implementing our undertakings in these
agreements," Baker told the meetings.
    Darman said Baker had been misinterpreted by markets which
wrongly believed earlier remarks suggested he wanted a further
decline in the dollar. Baker, Darman said, was committed to
stabilizing currencies at current levels.
    Last week's statement from the seven reaffirmed a February
22 agreement in Paris in which the Reagan administration agreed
to reach a budget deficit compromise with Congress and to fight
protectionism.
    West Germany and Japan, meanwhile, agreed to stimulate
domestic demand and lead a global upturn.
    Ministers believed the Paris pact was bolstered by Japan's
promise of a 35 billion dlr supplementary budget.
    The sources said they believed Baker saw it as a major
action. But the seven seem to accept their commitment to stable
currencies applied to today's exchange rates and not those at
the time of the Paris agreement, when the dollar stood higher.
    The Paris accord said, "currencies (are) within ranges
broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals, given
the policy commitments summarized in this statement."
    Now they accept the dollar's lower level, especially
against the yen, as hard reality that is nonetheless consistent
with the agreement. "The ministers and governors reaffirmed the
view that around current levels their currencies are within
ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals," last week's
statement read.
    Monetary sources said policymakers understood markets were
focusing on instability created by the gap between the U.S.
Trade deficit and the surpluses of West Germany and Japan
rather than prospective policy changes. European monetary
sources said Bonn was still unconvinced that Washington meant
business with its commitment to cut the budget deficit.

<TITLE>INSTITUTES SEE NO WEST GERMAN RECESSION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The five leading West German economic
research institutes, which have revised down their forecasts
for 1987 growth, do not predict a recession in West Germany,
their spokesman, Hans-Juergen Schmahl said.
    The institutes were divided in their spring report on
forecasts for 1987, with three predicting two pct growth and
two seeing only one pct expansion. Growth was 2.4 pct in 1986.
    Schmahl, presenting the report at a news conference, said,
"None of the institutes reckons with a recession or with the
beginning of a recession." He added, however, that exports
remained the weak point of the economy .
    Schmahl also said West Germany would have to expect further
encroachments of foreign goods onto its markets.
    Arthur Krumper of Munich's Ifo institute, which with the
DIW of West Berlin had presented the more pessimistic view of
the economy, said, "The braking effects (on the economy)
produced by external factors will remain considerable for most
of the year."

<TITLE>CRAZY EDDIE &lt;CRZY> SETS DEFENSIVE RIGHTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    EDISON, N.J., April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Crazy Eddie Inc said its board has
adopted a defensive shareholder rights plan and said it has
received "friendly inquiries" on its acquisition.
    It said under the plan, shareholdrs of record as of April
21 will receive a right to purchase under certain circumstances
at a price of 42 dlrs 0.01 preferred share for each common
share held.  The rights will expire April Nine.
    The company said the rights would be exercisable 20
business days after a party were to acquire 20 pct or more of
Crazy Eddie common stock or announce a tender or exchange offer
that would result in ownership of 30 pct or more.
    Crazy Eddie said if a party owning 20 pct or more of its
stock were to merge into it or if a party were to acquire 40
pct or more of Crazy Eddie stock, right holders other than the
acquiring party would be entitled to acquire common shares or
other securities or assets with a market value equal to twice
the rights' exercise price.
    If after a party acquired 20 pct or more of its stock Crazy
Eddie were acquired or 50 pct of its earnings power or assets
sold, rightholders other than the acquirer would be entitled to
buy shares of the acquirer's common stock worth twice the
rights' exercise price, the company said.
    Crazy Eddie said if a party were to acquire 30 pct or more
of its common stock and then fail to acquire Crazy Eddie within
180 days thereafter, rightholders would be entitled to exchange
their Crazy Eddie common stock for subordinated notes of Crazy
Eddie maturing either one year or, above a certain dollar limt,
five years after issuance.
    Crazy Eddie said adoption of the plan is not in response to
any known effort to acquire control of it.  But the company
said it has become aware of some "possible accumulations" of
its stock has has received some "friendly inquiries."

foreign exchange auction to 18.75 kwacha to the dollar from
last week's 16.95, the Bank of Zambia said.
    The rate was the lowest since the auctions resumed two
weeks ago under a new two-tier exchange rate system worked out
with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
    The Bank of Zambia said it received 370 bids, ranging from
13.00 to 20.75 kwacha, for the six mln dlrs on offer. One
hundred and thirty-five bids were successful.
    A British High Commission spokesman said Britain would put
eight mln stg into the auction at a rate of one mln a week as
soon as Zambia reached a full agreement with the IMF.
    The money could be spent only on goods produced and
supplied by British firms, excluding luxuries and defence
equipment, the spokesman added.

<TITLE>U.S. SENATE LEADER CALLS FOR INTEREST RATE CUTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Senate Finance Committee Chairman
Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) called on major industrial countries to
make a pledge at the coming economic summit in Venice to cut
interest rates.
    "I think at the summit meeting in Venice what we ought to be
trying to do is to get the other major industrial nations that
are involved to bring interest rates down, say, one pct,"
Bentsen told NBC Television's "Meet the Press."
    Bentsen said coordinated rate cuts could take "billions off
the debt service of the Latin countries" and help ease
protectionist pressures in the industrial countries.
    Bentsen also South Korea and Taiwan should be pressured to
revalue their currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar.
    "You take the Taiwanese, with an enormous capital surplus,
enormous trade surplus, and we've had very little cooperation
there," he said.
    Departing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman told the
same television network he agreed that the U.S. dollar had not
fallen enough against the currencies of some countries.
    "I think that more does have to be done there in
negotiations with the countries involved, the so-called NICs
(newly industrialized countries)," he said.
    Darman said such negotiations with newly industrialized
countries were underway privately.
    Bentsen predicted Congress and the White House would agree
on a fiscal 1988 budget that would raise between 18 and 22
billion dlrs in new revenues.
    The Texas senator said a series of excise taxes would be
considered by Congress, including an extension of the telephone
tax and new levies on liquor and cigarettes.
    Bentsen said he supported an oil import fee, but that it
would not happen without President Reagan's support.
    Darman called for a "top level negotiation" between the White
House and Congress on a budget compromise that would include
asset sales, some excise taxes, cuts in middle-class
entitlement programs, "a reasonable, steady rate of growth in
defense" and reform of the budget process.

<TITLE>OFFER FOR DOME MAY SHORT-CIRCUIT ITS DEBT TALKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Larry Welsh, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>A 3.22 billion dlr offer for Dome
Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO>
may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the door
for more takeover bids, oil analysts said.
    Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt
of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim
debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer
substantial payments to creditors will expire.
    Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholders
that an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan.
    Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as
public noteholders in March after several months of delicate
negotiations.
    TransCanada's proposal "amounts to a quasi debt
restructuring," oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker
Ltd said from Toronto.
    Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allow
creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet
to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to
cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.
    "The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that
even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that
Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,"
said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in
Calgary.
    TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome
was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed
refinancing packages, Gobert said.
    The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome
since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders
to agree to a restructuring, he added.
    "I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain
any and all offers (for Dome)," Gobert said.
    Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that
TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix
the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other
possible buyers from making an offer. "By drawing attention to
us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little
reluctant to come forward," he said.
    Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal
offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a
confidential agreement between the two companies, he said.
    Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions
with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other
unidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and
financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including
TransCanada's.
    Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair price
for the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings.
    However, he said not enough financial details are known
about Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of
TransCanada's proposed offer.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>SOSNOFF RAISES BID FOR CAESARS WORLD &lt;CAW></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Investor Martin T. Sosnoff said he has
raised his offer for Caesars World Inc shares to 32 dlrs each
from 28 dlrs and has reduced the number of shares he is seeking
to 29.1 mln from all those not already owned.
    In a newspaper advertisement, Sosnoff said the bid by his
MTS Acquisition Corp, withdrawal rights and the proration
period will now expire June 19 unless extended. The offer had
been scheduled to expire May 15. In late March, Sosnoff said he
had received a "negligible" number of shares in response to the
offer, which had been rejected by Caesars as inadequate.
    Sosnoff already owns about four mln of Caesars' 30 mln
common shares now outstanding, or a 13.3 pct interest on a
primary basis.
    Last week, Caesars' board approved a recapitalization plan
as an alternative to the Sosnoff offer under which shareholders
would receive a special dividend of 25 dlrs per share, subject
to approval by shareholders at a special meeting to be held in
June.
    The company planned to borrow 200 mln dlrs and sell 800 mln
dlrs in debt to finance the payout.
    Sosnoff said in the newspaper advertisement that the
amended offer is conditioned on receipt of enough shares to
give him a majority interest on a fully diluted basis and on
the arrangement of financing, as well as to approvals by New
Jersey and Nevada gaming authorities.
    He said the tender would be the first step in acquiring all
of Caesars' shares and if successful would be followed by a
merger transaction.
    Sosnoff said later in a statement that the 29.1 mln shares
he is now seeking, together with the 4,217,675 shares he owns,
would give him a 92.4 pct interest on a fully diluted basis.
    He said he still has received only a "negligible" number of
shares in response to his tender.
    In a letter to Caesars' chairman Henry Gluck included in
the statement, Sosnoff said Gluck had again refused, on April
8, to meet with him, even though he had said he was willing to
increase the price of his offer.
    Sosnoff said the financing for the offer is almost fully in
place.
    Sosnoff said PaineWebber Group Inc &lt;PWJ> has now delivered
to him commitments to purchase up to 475 mln dlrs of increasing
dividend cumulative exchangeable preferred stock of MTS Holding
Corp, an indirect parent corporation of MTS Acquisition.
    He said Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM>, which leads a
syndicate that has provided commitments for a 500 mln dlr
margin facility, believes it will be able to arrange for
further commitments under the margin facility to advance up to
an additional 25 mln dlrs that may be needed to permit the
purchase of shares under the offer.
    Sosnoff said under the merger that would follow his tender,
each of the 2,750,000 Caesars shares not covered by the offer,
or 7.6 pct on a fully diluted basis, would be converted into
Series A preferred stock valued at 32 dlrs per shareby an
independent investment baking firm.
    He said "To the extent that fewer than 29,100,000 sdhares
are purchased in the offer, the stockholders would receive a
combination of cash and Series A preferred stock having a value
of 32 dlrs per share of Caesars."
    Sosnoff said he believes terms of his offer are superior to
Caesars' recapitalization.
    Sosnoff said he will be meeting this week with gaming
officials in Nevada in an effort to expedite the investigatory
process required for regulatory approval, a process that it
already underway in New Jersey.
    He said his offer has been extended based on the likely
duration of the regulatory process.
    He said he intends to further extend the offer if the
approval process is not completed by the expiration date.

<TITLE>PORTUGUESE ECONOMY REMAINS BUOYANT DESPITE CRISIS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Pascal Fletcher, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LISBON, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Portugal's economy, which has been
enjoying one of its most buoyant periods in more than a decade,
may now be strong enough to shrug off the country's latest
government crisis, analysts said.
    But the April 3 ousting of Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco
Silva's government could slow economic reforms and investment
as Portugal continues to adapt to membership in the European
Community, which it joined in January last year, they said.
    Cavaco Silva's minority Social Democratic Party, PSD, was
toppled in a parliamentary censure vote by left-wing parties.
    The centre-right administration had made economic growth
reform a priority in its 17 months in office.
    In 1986, Portugal's economy grew four pct, its current
account surplus swelled to more than one billion dlrs and
inflation fell to 10 pct, from 20 pct in 1985.
    Analysts and businessmen said the prospects of instability
were worrying but they felt the foundations for continued
growth had not been badly shaken.
    "The economy has developed a certain self-confidence that is
now less dependent on the political situation," said Fritz
Haser, economics professor at Universidade Livre, Lisbon.
    "The market doesn't see this as a real crisis yet," economist
Jorge Braga de Macedo told Reuters.
    Businessmen have identified political instability over the
last 13 years as one of the biggest obstacles to lasting
economic progress.
    The PSD administration was the 16th formed since the 1974
revolution.
    Portugal's developing stock markets, however, remain
buoyant. Brokers and unit trust managers said the recent surge
in economic confidence under the PSD rule was still largely
underpinned by continuing optimistic forecasts.
    Investment grew nearly 10 pct in 1986 and a Bank of
Portugal forecast, released on the day the PSD government fell,
predicted the pace of investment and overall economic growth
would remain at similar levels this year.
    But analysts said the crisis interrupted current policies
and could slow economic development.
    Soares, who is expected to announce a decision by the end
of the month, can either call early elections or form a new
government from parties in the existing left wing-dominated
parliament.
    Many businessmen said they strongly favoured quick
elections as the best solution. "There is a good chance that a
majority government could result from early elections,"
Confederation of Portuguese Industry (CIP) president Pedro
Ferraz da Costa said.
    He said they were optimistic this could mean the
continuation in the near future of liberalisation policies
introduced over the last year.
    The left-wing parties favour a parliamentary solution, but
the PSD said it wants an early election in which opinion polls
say they could win an overall majority.
    A PSD majority would also open the way for more
wide-ranging reforms, such as relaxation of labour laws and
possible denationalisation of industry, the analysts said.
    Cavaco Silva has accused the left-wing opposition parties
of blocking key economic reforms.
    The left-wingers said Portugal's positive economic results
were more the product of favourable international conditions
such as cheaper oil and raw material imports, than of PSD
policies.

<TITLE>COLUMBIA GAS &lt;CG> SEEKS CONTRACT COST RECOVERY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHARLESTON, W. Va., April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Columbia Gas Transmission
corp said it made an abbreviated, streamlined filing with the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to recover a portion if
its costs of renegotiating high-cost gas purchase contracts.
    Recently, the Columbia Gas System Inc pipeline subsidiary
said, FERC denied on procedural grounds and without prejudice a
proposal to include these costs in the company's most recent
purchased gas adjustment -- or PGA -- filing.
    Noting it has has asked for a rehearing on the denial
ruling, Columbia Gas said it would withdraw its alternative
filing if the commission grantes its request for a rehearing to
include the contract renegotiation costs in its PGA or
consolidates this issue in the pipeline's general rate filing
and permit recovery, subject to refund, effective April one.
    The company said the alternative filing seeks to recover
about 79 mln dlrs a year through the pipeline's non-gas sales
commodity rates. This annual amortization amount is based on
recovery of about 653 mln drls over an 8-1/4 year period,
beginning April 1, 1987.
    Columbia Gas said the filing would increase the pipeline
commodity rates by 15.74 cts per mln Btu to 2.95 dlrs per mln.
    The company said it orginially sought to include these
costs in its PGA since the payments to products resulted in
almost five billion dlrs in prospective price relief and were
not related to take-or-pay buyout costs.
    It explained this interpretation was based on FERC's April
10, 1985, Statement of Policy which said that only take-or-pay
buyout costs must be recovered through a general rate filing
under the Natural Gas Act.
    As a result of renegotiating contracts for high-cost gas,
Columbia Gas said, it has been able to reduce the average price
paid for gas purchased from Southwest producers to 1.96 dlrs
per mln Btu in December 1986 from 3.64 dlrs per mln in April
1985.
    The pipeline said Southwestern producers account for 46 pct
of its total available gas supply this year.

<DATELINE>    BUDAPEST, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hungary has announced sharp price
increases for a range of food and consumer products as part of
its efforts to curb a soaring budget deficit.
    The official MTI news agency said the government decided
consumer price subsidies had to be cut to reduce state
spending. From today the price of meat will rise by an average
18 pct and that of beer and spirits by 10 pct, MTI said.
    The measures are also aimed at cooling an overheated
economy, and could help dampen Hungarians' appetite for
imported Western goods which consume increasingly expensive
hard currency, the diplomats said.
    The diplomats also said, however, that they did not expect
the kind of social unrest that followed sharp price rises in
other East Bloc states, notably Poland.
    MTI said consumer goods will also become more expensive,
with the price of refrigerators rising some five pct. It also
announced a number of measures to ease hardship, including
higher pensions and family allowances.

11.1 pct.
    A total of 10,968 kilos of silver were assayed, an 11.1 pct
rise.
    The number of platinum items marked fell 12.5 pct to 1,785,
while in weight terms the total slipped 8.1 pct to 9,849 grams.
    A spokesman for the Assay Offices of Great Britain said he

the Swiss National Bank fell 4.64 billion Swiss francs to 7.88
billion in the first 10 days of April, the National Bank said.
    Foreign exchange reserves rose by 9.4 mln francs to 33.12
billion.
    Sight deposits are an important measure of money market
liquidity in Switzerland.
    The National Bank said banks repaid around 5.8 billion
francs of traditional central bank credit taken out to meet
their end-of-quarter liquidity requirements. This was partially
offset by new swap arrangements.
    Bank notes in circulation fell 440.2 mln francs to 24.48
billion while other deposits on call at the National Bank --
mainly government funds -- fell 840.5 mln francs to 941.5 mln.

one dlr per share on 71.3 mln average shares outstanding.
    In last year's first quarter the company lost 60.0 mln dlrs
or 55 cts per share on 108.4 mln shares outstanding, after a
110.8 mln dlr writedown of oil reserves of its Celeron Corp
unit.
    Goodyear said it will report first quarter results April 27.
    Goodyear chairman Robert E. Mercer also told the annual
meeting that unless there is a major downturn in the economy,
it expects to work its debt down to normal levels in three
years through its restructuring and cash flow from improved
margins.
    The company set up its restructuring program to fend off a
hostile takeover attempt by Sir James Goldsmith.  As part of
the restructuring, Goodyear executed a major stock buyback
program that resulted in an increase in its debt.

<TITLE>TRADE ISSUES STRAINING EC'S PATIENCE WITH JAPAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Member states of the European
Community are starting to run out of patience with Japan which
they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open
its market to imports, but as often made only minor moves.
    Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC
countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the
willingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanese
government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC.
    However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, as
EC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan.
   Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to
an EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could
raise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S.
Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17.
    The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligations
entered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designed
to stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of
the U.S.
    The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC's
trade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs in
March, up from 1.94 billion in February.

<TITLE>EC COULD DECIDE ON JAPAN TRADE MOVES IN LATE MAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community (EC) has
effectively given Japan six weeks to take moves to open its
market to imports before it decides on possible tough
retaliatory trade measures, EC diplomats said.
    They said EC foreign ministers will meet on May 25 and 26
to review the state of trade relations between the two sides.
    The EC executive commission was asked by representatives of
member states on Friday to propose a renunciation of some EC
pledges to the world trade body, GATT, unless there are
"adequate and early measures to open the Japanese market."
    Such a renunciation would be the first step to imposing
stiff increases in duties, or quantitative limits, on Japanese
exports.
    The diplomats said it was unlikely that the issue would be
discussed in detail at the next meeting of EC foreign ministers
on April 27 and 28 in Luxembourg as time was needed to prepare
proposals for possible retaliatory action.
    They said the commission has powers to take some limited
action before getting ministerial approval to prevent Japanese
exports of electrical, photographic and other goods being
diverted to Europe following of possible U.S. Tariff moves.
    In May, the ministers are also likely to discuss how to
prevent Japan from getting an extra trading advantage as a
result of Spain and Portugal joining the bloc, which obliges
them gradually to reduce tariffs on many industrial goods.
    Japan's trade surplus with the Community has grown
steadily, registering a record 2.13 billion dlrs in March.

<DATELINE>    ARMONK, N.Y., April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>International Business Machines
Corp said shipments and revenues were higher in the first
quarter, but net earnings fell 22.8 pct in part due to higher
expenses.
    IBM said net income fell to 785 mln dlrs or 1.30 dlrs a
share from 1.02 billion dlrs or 1.65 dlrs on about 1.8 pct
fewer shares outstanding.
    While total sales and income rose 5.5 pct to 10.68 billion
dlrs from 10.13 billion dlrs, costs and expenses rose 12.1 pct
to 9.61 billion dlrs from 8.57 billion in the quarter, the
computer maker said.
    The company said it continues to take actions to make it
more competitive, including cost and expense reduction
measures.
    "Although the worldwide economic situation remains
unsettled, there are some encouraging signs in our business,"
IBM said in a statement.
    "In addition to the increase in first quarter shipments, we
have announced new offerings in our large processor and
personal computing product lines," it said.
    "We have yet to fully benefit from our recent product
announcements, retirement incentives and other resource
balancing measures, and we expect these actions will have a
more significant impact as 1987 progresses," the company added.
    It said it expects more than 12,000 U.S. employees to take
advantage of the retirement incentives announced last year.
    Pretax earnings fell 27 pct to 1.34 billion dlrs from 1.83
billion, IBM said. Pretax margins slipped to 12.5 pct in 1987
from 18.1 pct in 1986, it said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>GERMAN INSTITUTES WARN ON MONEY SUPPLY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Four of West Germany's five leading
economic research institutes warned that excessive monetary
growth threatened a resurgence of inflation.
    But in a dissenting view the DIW institute in West Berlin,
echoing recent statements by leading Bundesbank officials, said
the expansion seen over the last 1-1/2 years did not
necessarily threaten stability.
    The five institutes issued a joint spring report, in which
three -- Kiel, Hamburg and Essen -- forecast a two pct rise in
GNP in 1987, while West Berlin and Munich predicted one pct.
    The four institutes said an expansive policy was welcome in
view of the slowdown in economic activity. But experience has
shown that strong monetary growth eventually leads to a price
rise which undoes the beneficial effects of monetary policy.
    Given virtual zero inflation in West Germany such fears may
seem exaggerated, they said.
    "But it has often turned out in the past that the price
climate can quickly deteriorate, forcing the central bank into
a restrictive policy," they said.
    The economic costs of a preventive stability policy are
less than fighting inflation once it has taken hold, they said.
    The four institutes disputed the view that monetary
expansion would slow of its own accord in 1987 as domestic
investors switch liquidity into longer term capital market
investments following lower interest rates.
    "Such redispositions may temporarily dampen the expansion of
central bank money stock, but do not automatically lead to a
smaller expansion of money supply," they said.
    A return to growth and stability did not require
spectacular central bank moves, but could be done quietly with
open market operations and repurchase pacts, which would avoid
an interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations.
    The DIW institute said monetary policy should not be
focused simply on growth of production potential. Because of
uncertainty about exchange rate developments and economic
weakness other factors should be taken into account.
    Monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cuts
and avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluation
speculation. Recent strong monetary expansion was not a threat
in itself to price stability.
    The 1979/81 inflation following strong 1977/78 money growth
reflected other causes, such as rising oil prices and the
falling mark.

<TITLE>USDA CHANGES LOW PROTEIN WHEAT TERMINAL PRICES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>   WASHINGTON, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Agriculture Department has
lowered its ASCS terminal prices for low protein hard red
winter and hard red spring wheat at a number of locations, a
senior USDA official said.
    USDA reduced the price of hard red winter wheat at Kansas
City and Texas by six cents, at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32
cents and at St Louis by nine cents, Ralph Klopfenstein, deputy
administrator of commodity operations at the Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service, said.
    The department also lowered the terminal price of hard red
spring wheat at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32 cents, he said.
    In addition, USDA cut the Pacific Northwest price of hard
red spring wheat by 31 cents, USDA officials who asked not to
be identified said.
    The officials said hard red spring wheat prices at Chicago,
Denver and Toledo were adjusted by about the same amount as at
Pacific Northwest, Duluth and Minneapolis.
    The price changes should lead to a pickup of PIK and roll
activity, Klopfenstein said. The price change was decided upon
last week and will be effective today, he said.
    Klopfenstein also said the department raised the premiums
on high protein wheat to offset the drop in low protein wheat
prices, meaning the net price on any wheat commanding a protein
premium would remain unchanged.

<TITLE>COOPERVISION &lt;EYE> FORMS RECAPITALIZATION PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PALO ALTO, Calif, APril 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Coopervision Inc said it is
preparing a recapitalization plan, which includes a common
stock repurchase program and an exchange of debt securities for
common stock.
    The plan, along with a proposal to change its name to
Cooper Cos Inc, will be submitted for shareholders' approval at
the company's annual meeting on June 22.
    The meeting had been postponed from its original date of
May 14 in order to let management review recapitalization
options, it said.
    In addition, Coopervision said operating income in its
current fiscal quarter ending April 30 is expected to show an
improvement over its prior fiscal quarter's 82.5 mln dlrs and
its year ago quarter.
    Income from continuing operations was not immediately
availalbe for the prior year's second quarter in which it
reported a net loss of 14.9 mln dlrs.
    At a Drexel Burnham Lambert Investor Conference,
Coopervision chairman Parker Montgomery said, as previously
announced, he will listen to any bid that makes sense for
shareholders.
    He also said Coopervision's stock fell in 1986 due to its
second quarter loss, rumors of a liquidation at 30 dlrs and 35
dlrs a share, and Ivan Boesky's subsequent sale of his
position.
    "The stock dropped six dlrs in three days after Boesky sold
his position and has never recovered," Montgomery said. The
company's stock is currently trading at 19-1/4.
    Montgomery further told the conference, "Don't be an
investor in the stock on the basis of any short term recovery
in operating or net income in 1987 and 1988."
    "Our concentration is on maintaining or increasing market
share in our core businesses this year and next, regardless of
the impact to the bottom line," he said.

Co for an operating joint venture on Hecla's Stibnite, Idaho,
gold deposit.
    Giant Bay said if its bioleaching technology is used for
ore processing, it will have the right to acquire a working
interest in the property. It said it may spend as much as three
mln U.S. dlrs, excluding capital costs to bring the mine into
production. It said drilling has indicated substantial sulphide
reserves with a gold grade of about 0.1 ounce a ton, and early
tests show the gold ore responds to bioleaching.

<TITLE>PENTLAND TO REDUCE REEBOK &lt;RBK> HOLDINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pentland Industries PLC said it report
a substantial capital gain from the sale of part of its
holdings in Reebok International Limited, which will cut its
stake in Reebok to 32.2 pct from 36.7 pct.
     It said Reebok filed a registration statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission for the offering of six mln
shares of Reebok common. Reebok will sell three mln shares and
Pentland will sell 1,404,866 shares, reducing its stake in
Reebok to 18.1 mln from 19.5 mln shares.
    After the offering, Reebok will have 56.1 mln shares shares
outstanding.
    Pentland said the amount of the capital gain from the sale
depends on the offering price for the Reebok shares to be
negotiated between it, Reebok, and the other selling
stockholders who will offer about 1.6 mln shares of Reebok
common, and the underwriters.
    Pentland said proceeds from the offering will be used by
Reebok to retire bank debt incurred in its acquisition of AVIA
Group for about 180 mln dlrs. Is said that afterwards, Reebok
will have bank credit lines available for general corporate
purposes, including possible acquisitions.
    Reebok's stock was selling at 45-1/2, up 1/8. At that
price, the 1.4 mln Reebok shares Pentland will sell are worth
about 64 mln dlrs and the three mln shares Reebok will sell are
worth about 136.5 mln dlrs.
    Pentland said it will use proceeds to fund growth and
possible acquisitions.
    Pentland said 4,500,000 shares of Rebbok will be offered in
the U.S. by a syndicate led by Kidder, Peabody and Co Inc and
1,500,000 shares will be offered outside the U.S. by an
international syndicate led by Kidder.
    It said the U.S. underwriters have been granted an option
to buy from certain selling stockholders up to an additional
900,000 shares to cover overallotments. Pentland said it has
not chosen to participate in this over allotment.
    Pentland said that as soon as the date and price of the
offering have been determined it will release further details.
    It said it expects the offering to close in May.

    Excluding the impact of the non-accrual loans, Irving said

<TITLE>ALLIED STORES &lt;ALS> SELLS DILLARD &lt;DDS> TWO UNITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dillard Department Stores Inc, based
in Little Rock, Ark., and Allied Stores Corp jointly said they
entered a definitive purchase agreement for the sale to Dillard
of the Joske's and the Cain-Sloan divisions of Allied for 255
mln dlrs cash, subject to certain closing adjustments.
    The sale excludes certain real estate assets of Joske's and
Cain-Sloan, which Allied estimates have an aggregate value of
30 mln dlrs based on current market conditions.
    Joske's has 26 stores in Texas and one in Arizona.
Cain-Sloan has four stores in Nashville. Joske's is the largest
unit Allied has slated for sale in its restructuring.
    Allied Stores Corp, a subsidiary of Campeau Corp, was
acquired by acquired by the Canadian developer last year.
    Robert Campeau, chairman of Allied, said "this is a
terrific start to our disposition program which is proceeding
well ahead of schedule. This sale will fulfill the requirements
under our bank agreements to sell certain assets by June 30 and
give us additional flexibility in the disposal of the remaining
divisions being sold."
     Allied Stores is required to pay 200 mln dlrs in bank debt
by June 30. There had been some doubts on Wall Street that the
company could meet the payment.
    A Campeau source said, "We believe this cash sale puts us
in a very strong negotiating position to maximize the proceeds
Allied can receive from its other divisions."
    "Allied was able to put itself in a position where it knows
it will be able to meet the June 30 payment schedules," the
source said.
    About 1.1 bilion dlrs in Allied assets had been targeted
for sale by Dec. 31, 1988 to pay for the aquisition of Allied
by Campeau.
    Allied will be taking bids for its other divisions.
Targeted for sale are Bonwit Tellers, Garfinckel's, Dey's,
Donaldson's, Herpolsheimer's, Heer's, Miller's, Miller and
Rhoads, Pomeroy's, Catherine's, Plymouth Shops, and Jerry
Leonard. The divisions provided 38.4 pct of Allied net sales
and 11.8 pct of store profit in fiscal 1985.

<TITLE>NCR &lt;NCR> CONTINUES TO EXPECT EARNINGS GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DAYTON, Ohio, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>NCR Corp, earlier reporting higher
first quarter profit, said it continues to expect that it will
report record earnings and revenue for all of 1987.
    "Our optimism is based on our incoming order rates and the
strength of our product lines," the company said.
    NCR Corp plans additional new product announcements this
year, it said without elaborating.
    NCR earlier said first quarter profit increased to 61.5 mln
dlrs or 65 cts share from 50.2 mln dlrs or 51 cts share in the
prior year. NCR's 1986 full-year earnings rose to 336.5 mln
dlrs from 315.2 mln dlrs in the prior year.
    NCR said the increase in first quarter profit resulted from
strong revenue growth, which was particularly strong in Europe
and Pacific marketing groups.
    Growth in U.S. revenues also improved, the company said.
First quarter revenues increased to 1.12 billion dlrs from
960.8 mln dlrs in the prior year.
    NCR's U.S. dollar value of 1987 first quarter worldwide
incoming orders posted a very substantial gain over the prior
year first quarter, NCR also said without giving specific
figures. Order growth was broad based across NCR's product
lines, with the greatest growth coming from U.S., it said.

construction company, has arranged a 50 mln stg commercial
paper program, with an option to issue notes in U.S. Dollars,
Mowlem treasurer Philip Ridal said.
    He said the company hopes to make the first drawings in May
to take advantage of lower borrowing costs and the greater
flexibility afforded by this program. It also should increase
the company's arbitrage opportunities, he added.
    The program was arranged by Kleinwort Benson Ltd, which
will act as a dealer along with Morgan Grenfell and Co Ltd and
Swiss Bank Corp International Ltd.
    The sterling notes will be sold in denominations of one mln
and 500,000 stg and will have maturities of seven to 364 days.
    Ridal said the new program will complement a note issuance
facility the company arranged last year and also increase the
investor base.

<TITLE>FOSTER &lt;FWC> UNIT AUDIT REVEALS DISCREPANCIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Foster Wheeler Corp &lt;FWC> said an
audit of its Stearns Airport Equiment Co Inc unit, revealed
"substantial discrepancies" in Stearns accounts that may
require material adjustments to previously announce
consolidated results of the company and its subsidiaries.
    Foster said certain Stearn officers and senior management
made Stearn's operations appear more profitable than they were
by improperly recording job costs. It said Stearn's president
and controller had resigned. A Foster spokesman said he did not
know the names of the president and controller, and could not
immediately comment on the release.
    Foster said the amount involved in the "discrepancy" is
about 13.7 mln dlrs before taxes or about 8.2 mln dlrs net
after tax due to an "improper recording of job costs over a
period of several years and continuing through part of the
first quarter of 1987."
    Stearns is a unit of Foster's Conergic Corp subsidiary.
The company said the impact on its results for 1987 was not
"likely to be significant" but the amount to be charged to
prior periods had not been determined.
    Foster reported after tax earnings of 28 mln dlrs, 26 mln
dlrs and 35.4 mln dlrs for 1986, 1985, and 1984, respectively.
    Stearns, based in Crowley, Texas, makes airport baggage
conveyor equipment and passenger loading bridges.
    Foster, a diversified international concern with 27
subsidiaries operating worldwide, is based in Livingston, New
Jersey. Its reported revenues for the period ended December 26,
1986 of 1.3 billion dlrs.
    The company said a detailed audit and investigation is
continuing. A company spokesman declined to comment further on
the investigation.

<TITLE>TAIWAN ANNOUNCES NEW ROUND OF IMPORT TARIFF CUTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, April 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>Taiwan announced plans for another round
of import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before trade
talks with Washington which officials described as a move to
help balance trade with the United States.
    Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry's
Customs Administration Department, told reporters the list of
products included 60 items asked by Washington.
    "The move is part of our government efforts to encourage
imports from our trading partners, particularly from the United
States," he said.
    He said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinet
that the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles,
apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cut
by between five and 50 pct.
    The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursday
and the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly starting
on April 20, he added.
    Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700
foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce its
growing trade surplus with the United States, the island's
largest trading partner.
    Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts and
pressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge trade
deficit with Taipei.
    Washington's deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6
billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985. It
widened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78
billion a year earlier, Taiwan's official figures show.
    Today's announcement came before a departure later today of
a 15-member Taiwan delegation for Washington for a series of
trade talks with U.S. Officials.
    The delegation's leader, Vincent Siew, told reporters last
night he was leaving with "a heavy heart," meaning that he would
face tough talks in Washington because of rising protectionist
sentiments in the U.S. Congress. Taiwan's 1986 trade surplus
with Washington was the third largest, after Japan and Canada.
    Siew said the talks, starting on April 14, would cover U.S.
Calls for Taiwan to open its market to American products,
purchases of major U.S. Machinery and power plant equipment,
import tariff cuts and protection of intellectual property.
    "I am afraid this time we have to give more than take from
our talks with the U.S.," he said without elaborating.

<TITLE>U.S. JUNK BONDS UNAFFECTED BY TEXACO &lt;TX> FILING</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By John Picinich, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Despite a sharp early fall in Texaco
Inc bonds, the 125 billion dlr U.S. junk bond market was
largely unaffected by Texaco's weekend filing for protection
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, analysts said.
    "Texaco's filing had little, if any, effect on junk bond
prices this morning. It should not spill over to the overall
market like LTV Corp's &lt;LTV> bankruptcy filing did last
summer," said one analyst.
    Traders said some Texaco debt issues fell over 30 points
this morning in thin trading, but recouped about half that.
    "Because of the Texaco filing, some investors bid down its
paper to the mid-60 area (around 650 dlrs per 1,000 dlr face
value) from around 95 Friday," said a dealer in high-yield, low
rated bonds.
    "But sellers could not be found at those levels and the
bids soon rebounded to the 75 to 85 area," he added, referring
to such issues as Texaco's 13 pct notes of 1991, the 13-1/4s of
1999 and 13-5/8s of 1994. All were in the mid-90s Friday.
    The rebound occurred after Standard and Poor's Corp
downgraded the debt ratings of 8.4 billion dlrs of debt of
Texaco and its subsidiaries to D, traders noted.
    S and P cited the weekend bankruptcy filing. The agency
said it uses the D grade for securities issued by companies in
Chapter 11 reorganization.
    Moody's Investors Service Inc followed suit, cutting most
of the debt of Texaco and its units to Caa.
    The junk bond market experienced a short-lived downturn
last summer when LTV's bankruptcy filing sparked worries that
credit conditions of other steel companies would also worsen.
    "This is clearly not the case with Texaco," said one
trader. Because of their high yields, junk bonds have lately
outperformed investment grade corporates, he and others said.
    Analysts and portfolio managers said they viewed Texaco's
bankruptcy filing as a defensive move.
    Indeed, a Texas State Court of Appeal this morning said the
bankruptcy petition effectively stays Texaco's obligation under
Texas law to post a bond in its 10.53 billion dlr litigation
against Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL>.
    "The filing was not the result of credit weakness. The
company got through the oil crisis alright," said one portfolio
manager.
    Others who run junk bond portfolios agreed with that
assessment and said they would still buy high-yield issues.

<TITLE>BULGARIA, ROMANIA GRAIN CROP SEEN LESS FAVORABLE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Current prospects for this year's
grain crop in Bulgaria and Romania appear less favorable than
in 1986, the U.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Belgrade
said in a field report.
    The report said the assessment was based on travel in the
two countries from March 30 to April 4.
    It said crop conditions were better than earlier expected
following the extreme dry conditions last fall and the
prolonged winter temperatures this spring.
    However, in general plant development was at least three
weeks or more behind normal this spring, and conditions varied
greatly by regions, the report said.
    Fields seeded during the optimum period last fall, and
especially those receiving supplemental irrigation water (about
65 pct of the fields observed), appeared to be in good
condition, with little evidence of winterkill, while others
varied considerably, the report said.
    Fields lacking adequate moisture last fall showed weak and
uneven stands. Spotty germination and winterkill in those
fields averaged 10 to 30 pct, it said.

<TITLE>SOVIET TANKERS SET TO CARRY KUWAITI OIL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KUWAIT, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Kuwait has agreed to charter tankers
from the Soviet Union in a move to protect its oil exports
through the Mideast Gulf, diplomatic sources said.
    They said the agreement followed months of talks with the
Soviet Union and the U.S. On ways to secure its oil exports
after Iran started to attack Kuwaiti-connected vessels in
retaliation for Kuwait's backing for Iran's war enemy Iraq.
    Diplomats said they expect three Soviet tankers initially
to reinforce other flags already supporting Kuwait's 22-tanker
fleet.
    The diplomats said they knew of no deal for Moscow to
provide a naval escort for its own vessels, but "the idea of
protection is implicit," one said.
    They said Soviet cargo ships bound for Kuwait in the past
to unload arms and materiel for road delivery to Iraq were
known to have sailed under escort. So far, none of the Soviet
ships are known to have been attacked by Iran. Diplomats said
they expected the chartered Soviet tankers to sail between
Kuwait and Khor Fakkan on the United Arab Emirates (UAE) coast
a short way outside the Strait of Hormuz at the mouth of the
Gulf.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>CHEMICAL &lt;CHL> NET HURT BY BRAZIL, EXPENSES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chemical New York Corp said its
first-quarter profits fell by 16 pct, largely because it placed
1.04 billion dlrs of loans to Brazil on non-accrual.
    Chemical reported first-quarter net income of 86.2 mln
dlrs, down from 102.6 mln a year earlier, but declaring the
Brazilian loans non-performing cost Chemical 21 mln dlrs in
lost interest income, or 12 mln dlrs after-tax.
    A 13.3 pct jump in non-interest expense to 471.3 mln dlrs
from 415.9 mln also hit the bottom line. It said the rise was
mainly due to staff costs associated with continued growth in
consumer, capital markets and investment banking activities.
    Excluding the effect of placing Brazil on non-accrual,
Chemical said its net income would have been 98.2 mln dlrs, or
4.3 pct below 1986 earnings.
    Brazil suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of
medium- and long-term debt on February 20. If they are not
resumed by year's end, Chemical said its after-tax net for the
whole of 1987 will be reduced by about 51 mln dlrs.
    Chemical also placed 52 mln dlrs of loans to Ecuador on
non-accrual because the Quito government also suspended
interest payments on its foreign debt. This reduced interest
income by 1.5 mln dlrs.
    Chemical said net interest income fell to 476.4 mln dlrs
from 488.9 mln and its net spread narrowed to 3.61 pct from
3.96 pct.
    This reflected the reclassification of Brazilian loans, a
reduced federal income tax rate (which affected the calculation
of the taxabale-equivalent adjustment on tax-exempt assets) and
a narrowing of the spread between the prime rate and Chemical's
cost of funds.
    Foreign exchange trading profits rose to 37.9 mln dlrs from
27.0 mln, but bond trading profits dropped to 21.9 mln dlrs
from 26.2 mln.
    Fees from trust and other banking services rose to 146.5

    The provision for loan losses was 87.2 mln dlrs, compared
with 83.8 mln. Net loan charge-offs were 86.5 mln, up from 60.7
mln, leaving the allowance for loan losses at 672.6 mln dlrs at
quarter's end, or 1.74 pct of loans outstanding, compared with
594.3 mln, or 1.50 pct, a year earlier.
    Non-accruing loans at the end of March were 2.39 billion
dlrs (1.35 billion excluding Brazil), compared with 1.35
billion at the end of 1986 and 1.22 billion at the end of
March, 1986.

<DATELINE>    CAMBRIDGE, Mass., April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Genetics Institute Inc,
earlier reporting an increased first quarter net loss, said it
expects to incur losses in fiscal 1987 "that are somewhat higher
than those reported in fiscal 1986."
    It had a loss of 4,504,000 dlrs for fiscal 1986 ended
November 30, compared to a fiscal 1985 loss of 1,732,00 dlrs.
    The company said the losses result from its strategic
decision to invest prudent levels of equity in development of
products the company can manufacture and bring to market.
    Genetics earlier said first quarter ended February 28
losses rose to 1,309,000 dlrs from year-ago loss of 937,000
dlrs.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>PRIMARY GILTS DEALERS NEED NOT BUY AT AUCTIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Primary dealers in U.K. Government gilts
will not be required to underwrite the government's offering of
its securities when the first auctions begin in Mid-May, the
Bank of England said.
    In an official notice released today, the Bank said "There
will be no formal or informal underwriting arrangement for the
auctions but the Bank encourages all gilt-edged market makers,
as part of their commitment to the market, to participate
actively in the auction process."
    The Bank was originally believed to have favoured requiring
the dealers to underwrite auctions, which are patterned after
those in the U.S. Treasury market.
    However, the Treasury was believed to have baulked at the
request by the 27 market makers for an allotment commission
which would discourage the largest institutional investors from
placing orders for new stock directly through the Bank of
England, thus denying primary dealers some of their best
customers. Commission would have been passed along to customers
who did place orders via the primary dealers, making it less
expensive to buy through them than to go directly to the Bank.
    Market sources said the Bank had, in its discussions with
the dealers about the upcoming auctions, agreed that the
allotment commission was reasonable if the dealers had a
concurrent commitment to buy at the auction regardless of
market conditions.
    Indeed, the Bank and the gilts dealers are believed to be
disappointed that the Treasury has not agreed to go along with
the plan. However, in its paper, the Bank suggested that any
conditions applied for the first few auctions may be abandoned
or modified in future sales of gilts if they prove inefficient
or unwieldy.
    Among other items in the document, the Bank said its first
auction will consist of up to 1.25 billion stg in conventional
short-dated stock and have a maturity of seven years or less.
    Subsequent auctions to be held in the 1987-88 financial
year would first be of up to one billion stg of long-dated
stock having a maturity of 15 years or longer and then of up to
one billion stg of medium dated stock of seven to 15 years in
maturity.
    The remainder of the gilt-edged funding program would be
met by traditional tap offerings of stock via the government
broker.
    To protect the buyers of the newly auctioned stock, the
Bank has agreed to establish a so-called fallow period, a
28-day period during which it agrees not to issue any new stock
of the same type, and it will not necessarily resume selling
the stock once the fallow period expires.
    In the event that prices offered for the stock to be sold
are substantially out of line with market conditions, the Bank
will agree to take the stock onto its own books.
    The bank would then be free to sell the stock during the
fallow period but not at a price below the minimum tender
price.
    The Bank also said that at least initially, auctions will
be alloted on a bid price basis, a system under which bidders
are allotted stock at the price which they bid.
    However, the Bank said it reserves the right to limit any
money market maker from buying more than 25 pct of a single
auction. The Bank is widely believed to be concerned about
preventing a single market maker from cornering a stock to
drive the price up.
   The Bank has repeatedly signalled its intention to prevent
dealers from cornering the market in a stock, issuing
additional stock, on occasion, to end a market shortage.
    The Bank has also agreed to publish information about the
auction results as soon as possible after the sale is complete,
which is widely expected to be on the same day.
    Information to be released will include the amount of stock
allotted in terms of both competitive and non-competitive bids,
and the highest, lowest and average price of the successful
bids.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Reserve entered the U.S.
Government securities market to arrange 1.5 billion dlrs of
customer repurchase agreements, a Fed spokesman said.
    Dealers said Federal funds were trading at 6-1/2 pct when
the Fed began its temporary and indirect supply of reserves to
the banking system.
    Most had expected the Fed to supply reserves directly via
System repurchase agreements or to add them indirectly through
two billion dlrs or more of customer repurchase agreements.
Some believe the Fed is adding fewer reserves than are needed
to keep upward pressure on rates and so help the dollar.

<TITLE>NATIONAL WESTMINSTER BANK USA 1ST-QTR NET RISES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>National Westminster Bank USA said
higher loans and core deposit volumes as well as a substantial
increase in net interest income contributed to a 16 pct rise in
first-quarter earnings to 17.7 mln dlrs from 15.3 mln reported
a year earlier.
    The earnings gain came despite a 1.5 mln dlr reduction of
income as a result of placing Brazilian loans on non-accrual.
    Net interest income totalled 92.5 mln dlrs compared with
91.7 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period as loans, mostly to
middle market businesses, increased by 896 mln dlrs. But some
of these gains were offset by low levels of interest rates.
    Provision for loan losses rose to 13.8 mln dlrs from 13.0
mln a year earlier. At March 31, the allowance for loan losses
was 114.2 mln dlrs versus 94.8 mln at end of March 1986.
    Non-accrual loans rose to 286 mln dlrs from 132 mln at the
end of the first quarter of 1986, largely because 119 mln dlrs
of loans to Brazil were put on non-accrual status.
    The bank said that if these loans remain on non-accrual for
the remainder of the year net income for 1987 would be reduced
by about 4.9 mln dlrs.
    National Westminster Bank USA is a wholly-owned subsidiary
of National Westminster Bank PLC.

<DATELINE>    Perugia, Italy, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Carlo De Benedetti's food
company Industrie Buitoni Perugina Spa said it has acquired the
Italian food group Vismara.
    Buitoni said in a statement that Vismara had 1986 sales of
181 billion lire and net profit of 11 billion lire, employs 950
people and has four subsidaries.
    Buitoni did not disclose financial details about the
acquisition. De Benedetti said last week that his group was
negotiating a purchase of an unidentified Italian food firm.
    Vismara primarily produces a variety of pork products. "The
acquisition represents a diversification in a market sector
with annual consumption of 8,500 billion lire," Buitoni said.
    Buitoni also said its consolidated revenue during the first
quarter of this year was 429 billion lire, up 51 pct from the
comparable 1986 period.
    As reported, Buitoni's consolidated revenue rose last year
to 1,623 billion lire from 1,177 billion in 1985. Net profit
rose to 18.5 billion lire from 448 mln lire in 1985.

in March after a one pct increase in February and a 1.2 pct
rise in March 1986, the National Statistics Institute said.
    The consumer price index (base 100 for 1976) rose to 772.0
from 761.3 in February and compared with 703.4 in March 1986.
    This gave a year-on-year March inflation rate of 9.8 pct
against 9.5 pct in February and 12.2 pct in March 1986.
    Measured as an annual average rate, inflation in March was
10.9 pct compared with 11.1 pct in February. The government
forecasts annual inflation of about eight pct this year.

<TITLE>TALKING POINT/IBM &lt;IBM></TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Lawrence Edelman, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>International Business Machines Corp
has started the year aggressively, but industry analysts said
the company still faces some tough rounds in its fight to stop
a two-year earnings slump.
    "I am more impressed with what's happening at IBM than I
have been in a long time," said PaineWebber analyst Stephen
Smith.
    "But they're not out of the woods yet," he added.
    At 1.30 dlrs a share, IBM's first-quarter net income easily
topped most estimates on Wall Street, which had ranged from an
even dollar to 1.20 dlrs.
    Most analysts said they were pleasantly surprised by IBM's
performance. But they indicated that IBM's chances for a full
recovery hinged on several key factors whose impact will not be
felt until later in the year.
    These include the success of IBM's new personal computer
line, introduced two weeks ago, and its 9370 minicomputers,
which will begin volume shipments in July.
    In addition, IBM has said the full benefits of its
early-retirement program and other cost-cutting moves will
emerge as the year progresses.
    Analysts noted that IBM chairman John F. Akers was
relatively more upbeat in assessing the company's outlook than
he has been for nearly a year.
    "Although the worldwide economic situation remains
unsettled, there are some encouraging signs in our business,"
Akers said, pointing to, among other things, higher
first-quarter shipments. "We remain optimistic about the
prospects for both the industry and IBM," he said.
    "Akers was most encouraging," said PaineWebber's Smith.
    A weak dollar, a lower tax rate and strong mainframe
computer sales all contributed to the better-than-expected
first-quarter results, analysts said.
    "Shipments of the 3090 mainframes were very strong in
March," after a weak January and February, said Ulric Weil of
Washington-based Weil and Associates.
    Sales of the top-of-the-line mainframes, commonly called
the Sierras, "bailed out the whole quarter," Weil said, adding,
"If this continues, it augers well for the rest of the year."

<TITLE>IRVING BANK &lt;V> 1ST-QTR NET HURT BY BRAZIL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Irving Bank Corp said a six pct drop
in first-quarter net income from a year earlier was largely the
result of placing medium- and long-term loans to borrowers in
Brazil and Ecuador on non-accrual status.
    Income in the first three months fell to 28.60 mln dlrs
from 30.43 mln in the same 1986 period. Earnings per share
dropped to 1.51 dlrs from 1.62.
    Irving put 215 mln dlrs of Brazilian and 33 mln dlrs of
Ecuadorean loans on non-accrual, reducing first-quarter net
income by a total of 4.4 mln dlrs after tax.
    Irving estimates full year net would be reduced by 15.3 mln
dlrs after tax if no cash interest payments are received on
these loans during the remainder of 1987.
    Also adversely affecting earnings were losses on the
trading of securities and higher non-interest expenses,
although these were partly offset by increased trust income,
profits from foreign exchange trading and investment securities
gains, the bank said.
    The allowance for loan losses was 224.8 mln dlrs, up from
185.2 mln a year earlier. The provision for loan losses was
21.8 mln versus 19.5 mln in the first quarter of 1986.

trade figures to be reported Tuesday by the Commerce Department
will be on a new basis reflecting more recent data, so avoiding
future revisions of the monthly figure, Commerce officials
said.
    The overall January deficit of 14.8 billion dlrs will be
revised, but the February figure will be a final one, officials
said.
    Previously, the initial monthly figure has had to be
revised in subsequent months because of the time lag between
the report and the compiling of final estimates on imports and
exports.
    The reporting of the February trade data was delayed
several weeks to permit gathering latest figures on imports and
exports to give a clearer picture of the monthly trade balance.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;MacAndrews and Forbes Group> and
Revlon Group Inc &lt;REV> said that they have entered into a
definitive mergewr agreement where MacAndrews will acquire
Revlon at 20.10 dlrs per common share in cash.
    MacAndrews said it increased its offer to purchase all
Revlon common shares to 20.10 dlrs a share, from its April 1
offer of 18.50 dlrs a share.
    Following consummation of the offer, a unit of MacAndrews

challenging acquisition of the shares by MacAnrews.
    The companies said the tender offer and withdrawal rights
will expireon Tuesday April 28, unless extended.
    MacAndrews said it will promptly file revised tender offer
material with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc is acting as dealer-manager for the offer,
the companies said.
    Revlon currently has about 42 mln shares outstanding. The
current offer price is about 782 mln dlrs, a company spokesman
said, up from the previous offer of 720 mln dlrs.
    On April 1, MacAndrews and Forbes, owned by Ronald
Perelman, offered 18.50 dlrs a share for the 63 pct of Revlon
shares he did not already own.
    Since the offer was made over a dozen shareholder lawsuits
were brought against Revlon alleging the original offer was too
low.
    But, the companies said these lawsuits have been settled in
the amended offer.

<TITLE>BANK OF ENGLAND TO MONITOR WHEN-ISSUED TRADING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    London, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England will step up
reporting requirements for primary dealers in U.K. Government
gilts during the when-issued trading period in between the date
an auction is announced and the date the sale is actually held.
    In its document on the auctions, the Bank said "The Bank is
content for such (when-issued) trading to cevelop subject to
certain conditions, in particular for predential supervision of
the credit risk to which the gilt-edged market makers and
Inter-dealer brokers may become exposed."
    The Bank is widely expected to require dealers to report
wehn-issued trading positions on a daily basis.
    When-issued trading presents certain unusual risks because
dealers are buying and selling a security that technically does
not exist although there is no uncertainty about when it will
be issued.
    Still, the fact there is no physical delivery possible
presents certain credit risks as well.
    The Bank is widely expected to expand its reporting
requiremenmts for unsettled trades, requiring firms to report
unsettled when-issued trades one day after they occur.
Normally, unsettled trades must be reported three days after
they occur.

<DATELINE>    TORONTO, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dome Petroleum Ltd shares moved higher
in the U.S. and Canada after TransCanada PipeLines Ltd &lt;TRP>
made a 4.3 billion Canadian dlr bid for Dome and Dome said it
is in talks with two other unidentified companies.
    Market speculation is that the other two potential bidders
are not Canadian companies and DuPont's &lt;DD> Conoco and
Atlantic Richfield Co &lt;ARC> are mentioned as possibilities,
Wilf Gobert of Peters and Co Ltd said.
    Dome rose 1/4 to 1-1/8 on the American Stock Exchange.
TransCanada PipeLines was down 1/4 at 15-3/4 on the New York
Stock Exchange.
    Dome was the most active stock on the Toronto exchange at
1.50 dlrs per share, up 37 cts.
    Gobert characterized the market action in Dome as "awfully
optimistic" but said investors are hoping for a competing offer
to the shareholders.
    TransCanada PipeLines' offer is to Dome management, not to
shareholders. However, it proposes issuing new equity in a
subsidiary that would operate Dome assets. Current Dome
shareholders would own 20 pct of the new subsidiary.

<TITLE>GTE &lt;GTE> CITES LOSS OF SPRINT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STAMFORD, Conn, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>GTE Corp said the decline in its
first quarter net income reflects a 121 mln dlr loss from its
50 pct share ownership of U.S. Sprint's operations.
    This loss is an increase from the 60 mln dlrs loss reported
on operations GTE owned a year ago quarter and prior to
entering a joint venture with United Telecommunications &lt;UT> in
July 1986. Under the joint venture, each company owns 50 pct of
Sprint.
    Earlier, the company reported net income declined to 265.0
mln dlrs from 283.0 mln dlrs in the first quarter a year ago.
    Theodore Brophy, chairman of GTE said, "we expect US
Sprint's losses to diminish later this year as customer traffic
migrates to the new fiber-optic network for long distance
telecommunications.
    The reason for the higher losses reflect lower prices as
well as higher operating costs related, in part, to the
fraudalent use of the network.
    Operating income of its telephone operations, which account
for 91 pct of the total, rose eight pct to 736.0 mln dlrs. 
Revenues from telephone operations rose eight pct to 2.9
billion dlrs.

<TITLE>GOODYEAR &lt;GT> TO SELL CELERON</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AKRON, Ohio, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co said it
expects to sell its Celeron Corp oil and gas subsidiary for
about two billion dlrs in about two months.
    After the company's annual meeting, Rober Mercer,
Goodyear's chairman and chief executive officer, also said 
Goodyear expects to report a profit of more than one dlr a
share from continuing operations in the first quarter. In the
same year-ago period, Goodyear reported a loss of 64 cents a
share from continuing operations.
    Mercer said about seven companies are interested in buying
Celeron and they may form a consortium to buy the unit.
    Celeron consists of oil and gas reserves and an almost
complete pipeline linking drilling operations in Santa Barbara,
Calif., to Texas refineries. Mercer said Celeron's reserves
would not be sold separately from the pipeline.
    Concerning speculation that two billion dlr price tag for
Celeron was too high, Mercer said "There is no fire sale going
on here and we can continue to keep Celeron as a profitable
operation throughout the year."
    Mercer said the expected 1st quarter operating profit was
based on the new share total after Goodyear's share repurchase
last year to fend off Sir James Goldsmith's hostile takeover
bid.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Aristech Chemical Corp chairman and
chief executive officer Thomas Marshall said analysts'
estimates of its 1987 fiscal year earnings of 2.25 dlrs to 2.50

    Addressing a gathering of analysts and institutional

share.
    He also said the first quarter estimates were 70 pct higher
than 1986's first quarter net of 29 cts per share.
Marshall attributibuted the first quarter earnings growth to
several factors, including sustained demand in Aristech's major
domestic markets and continued growth in exports.
    Aristech plans to spend approximately 200 mln dlrs over in
capital investments over the next three years, Marshall added.

<DATELINE>    KANSAS CITY, MO., April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>United Telecommunications Inc
said its lower first quarter earnings included a loss of
63,055,000 dlrs from its equity in US Sprint.
    US Sprint was formed July 1, 1986, as a partnership which
combined United Telecommunications' long distance voice and
data operations with those of GTE Corp &lt;GTE>.
    Earlier, United Telecommunications reported first-quarter
earnings of 12.6 mln dlrs, or 13 cts a share compared to 46.4
mln dlrs, or 47 cts a share a year ago. Revenues declined to
720.2 mln dlrs from 793.6 mln dlrs.
    United Telecommunications said the transition of US
Sprint's nationwide fiberoptic network is proceeding ahead of
schedule.
    It said the transition to the fiber network from interim
networks would not only reduce operating costs in the second
half of 1987, but also assist in controlling unauthorized
network use.

<TITLE>DOLLAR STRAIGHT BONDS END LOWER, TEXACO UNTRADED</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Christopher Pizzey, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The dollar straight sector of the
eurobond market ended lower after another nervous day's
trading, with many operators keeping to the sidelines ahead of
tomorrow's U.S. Trade figures for February, dealers said.
Prices of longer dated issues ended 1/2 or 5/8 point lower,
while short dates were 1/8 to 3/8 point easier.
    Bonds for Texaco Inc units hardly traded during the day
following the weekend news that the company filed for Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection in another twist to its long running
dispute with Pennzoil Co, dealers added.
    The Chapter 11 filing means that Texaco will not be paying
interest on its eurobonds. Dealers in the straight bonds noted
that the market in them had been basis only for some time prior
to the weekend's news. "It wasn't a true market, someone asked
you a price and you just gave them an idea," one said.
    However, the company's convertible bonds had been trading
since the company's share price provided a benchmark to which
dealers could establish a proper price level. The company has
two actively traded convertibles outstanding, a 500 mln dlr
bond due 1994 which pays 11-3/4 pct and a one billion dlr deal,
also due 1994, paying 11-7/8 pct.
    Traders even disagreed about last week's closing levels for
the convertible bonds, but a median appeared to be around 97 to
99 pct. Today, one trader said they were indicated initially at
65 to 70 pct before ending at some 79 83 pct.
    But he added, "That's only an idea. There's no real market
today. I've dealt once during the day, I'm not going to say at
what level." Other dealers were reluctant even to give an
indication of the bonds' levels.
    Dealers said the market in all Texaco deals will almost
certainly remain on an indicated, or negotiated, basis until
the events of the weekend are further clarified.
    The primary market had a steady day, with the Australian
dollar and the yen sectors again seeing the most activity,
dealers said. Deutsche Bank Finance NV Curacao became the first
of three issuers in the Australian dollar market during the
morning with a 100 mln dlr bond due 1990 paying 14-1/8 pct and
priced at 100-1/4 pct.
    The issue was lead managed by Deutsche Bank Capital Markets
(DBCM) and guaranteed by Deutsche Bank itself. A DBCM official
said the firm had placed 60 mln Australian dlrs of the issue
itself and quoted the deal at less one less 7/8 pct,
comfortably inside the 1-1/2 pct total fees.
    The State Bank of Victoria issued a 50 mln Australian dlr
bond paying 14-1/2 pct over three years and priced at 101-3/8
pct. Commerzbank AG was sole manager for the deal, which was
offered on one broker screen at less 1-1/2 pct.
    The day's other borrower in this sector was the New South
Wales Treasury Corporation guaranteed by the crown-in-right of
New South Wales. The five year bond pays 14-1/4 pct and was
priced at 101-7/8 pct.
    Lead manager was County Natwest Capital Markets. It was
quoted at less 1-7/8 less 1-3/4 pct, inside the two pct total
fees.
    Secondary market Australian dlr bonds ended little changed
on the day, with dealers saying that operators are awaiting the
Australian trade figures for March. A deficit of some 800 mln
to one billion dlrs was expected by one house active in the
sector.
    Union Bank of Switzerland (Securities) Ltd lead managed a
15 billion yen bond for Union Bank of Switzerland NV. The five
year deal pays 4-3/8 pct and features a put and call option at
par after four years.
    Priced at 101-5/8 pct, the issue was quoted at less 1-1/4
pct bid on the grey market compared with the total fees of
1-5/8 pct.
    Ente Nazionale per l'Energia Elettrica issued a 15 billion
yen bond due 1994 at 4-3/4 pct and priced at 101-7/8 pct. The
deal was quoted on the 1-7/8 pct total fees.
    Elsewhere, Alza Corp issued a 75 mln dlr convertible bond
due 2002 through Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. The par priced
issue has an indicated coupon of between 5-1/2 and 5-3/4 pct.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The February monthly merchandise
trade figures to be reported Tuesday by the Commerce Department
will be on a new basis reflecting more recent data, so avoiding
future revisions of the monthly figure, Commerce officials
said.
    The overall January deficit of 14.8 billion dlrs will be
revised, but the February figure will be a final one, officials
said.
    Previously, the initial monthly figure has had to be
revised in subsequent months because of the time lag between
the report and the compiling of final estimates on imports and
exports.
    The reporting of the February trade data was delayed
several weeks to permit gathering latest figures on imports and
exports to give a clearer picture of the monthly trade balance.

<TITLE>GAF &lt;GAF> SEEN RAISING BORG-WARNER &lt;BOR> BID</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    BY PATTI DOMM, REUTERS</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>GAF Corp, set on acquiring Borg-Warner
Corp's valuable plastics business, is believed by analysts to
be preparing an increased offer for the Chicago-based company.
     Yesterday, Borg-Warner said it agreed to be acquired for
4.23 billion dlrs by a company to be formed by Merrill Lynch
Capital Partners. Merrill offered 48.50 dlrs cash per share for
89 pct of Borg-Warner's common stock, and a package of cash and
securities for the balance.
    Borg-Warner stock rose 1-3/8 to 49-5/8.
    "I think it's (the stock price) telling us GAF is coming in
with another bid," said one analyst, who values the company at
51 or 52 dlrs per share.
    GAF has offered 46 dlrs per share. It holds 19.9 pct of
Borg-Warner's stock.
    "You're in a cat and mouse game on how you're going to up
the price. Obviously, nobody wants to pay more than you have
to. I think GAF is looking at the company the way we're looking
at it - that it's worth more," Pershing and Co analyst Richard
Henderson said.
    Henderson estimated it is worth abouth 55 dlrs per share.
    GAF has only said it was reviewing the situation. Merrill
Lynch officials did not return phone calls.
    Analysts have said they believe GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman
sought Borg-Warner because of its chemicals and plastics
business. The rigid plastics are used in such things as
telephones, computer terminals, and appliances.
    "Where the heck can you buy a world class chemical
operation these days," said Henderson.
    "He's (Heyman's) got the bucks. He's a heavy hitter, and he
does not like to get pushed around," said Henderson.
    GAF, a roofing and chemicals concern, attempted a takeover
of the much larger Union Carbide Corp two years ago. While GAF
did not win the company, it made a substantial gain on its
investment in Carbide.
    Analysts said GAF already has a large profit built into its
Borg-Warner holdings. They said even if GAF raises its offer
and does not succeed, a higher bid from another company would
give GAF millions of dollars in profits on its stock.
    "It's a win-win situation," said one analyst.
    One analyst speculated an offer from GAF would be
forthcoming shortly.
    "I think we are finally down to the final paragraph in this
book," he said.
    Borg-Warner's other businesses include automotive parts,
protective services, which includes Wells Fargo security
guards, and Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.
    Charles Rose, an Oppenheimer and Co analyst who follows
GAF, said if GAF were to sell into the Merrill Lynch offer, it
would realize about 125 mln dlrs net profit, or about 3.50 per
share.
    "I think there's a probability he goes up in price," said
Rose.
    Rose said, however, he could not really predict what Heyman
would do. "Sam's a low-risk, high-return player."
    "Is he trying to build a major industrial chemical
enterprise, or is he trying to be an investment bank," Rose
said.
    Analysts said Borg-Warner's chemical business would add
earnings momentum to GAF. "I worked out that paying as much as
50 dlrs per share would still be additive to GAF in time, if
they sold off most of the non-chemical facilities," said John
Henry of E.F. Hutton.
    Borg-Warner's chemical and plastics business provided 1986
operating profits of 153.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.04 billion
dlrs. Total operating profits were 349.7 mln dlrs, and net
earnings were 206.3 mln dlrs for 1986.
    "The Borg chemical business is great," said Rose, adding
its only U.S. competitors are Monsanto Co &lt;MCT> and Dow
Chemical Co &lt;DOW>.

<TITLE>EC MEAT DIRECTIVE DEADLINE SEEN FLEXIBLE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. officials said they held out
little hope the European Community, EC, would withdraw a
controversial meat inspection requirement, due to go into
effect April 30 and which U.S. meat producers claim will cut
off their exports.
    But the officials said they expect the EC to allow U.S.
plants to continue shipping meat through the end of the year
provided they submit a plant improvement program with the U.S.
Agriculture Department.
    The EC's so-called Third Country Meat Directive will
require foreign meat processing plants to comply fully with EC
inspection standards beginning April 30.
    The U.S. meat industry has prepared a petition requesting
the Reagan administration to retaliate against the EC rule.
    At issue are U.S. meat exports to the EC valued at 132 mln
dlrs in 1985.
    The EC rule would require all U.S. plants to make changes
in their inspection methods, ranging from veterinary staffing
to use of wood.
    Last December, the EC determined that only one U.S. cattle,
one hog and one sheep slaughtering facility could be approved
without further review. USDA would have to certify that the
plants had corrected the deficiencies.
    All remaining plants with a history or potential of
shipping to the EC -- totaling nearly 400 -- would require more
significant changes in plant constructions or procedures before
further EC review.
    Robert Hibbert, general counsel for the American Meat
Institute, said the meat industry expected to submit a formal
trade retaliation petition by April 30.
    An interagency committee is reviewing the industry's draft
petition.
    An official at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said
U.S. officials continued to press the EC to withdraw the rule,
but that "the chances of that are not too good at this time."
    However, there is the "expectation" in U.S. government and
meat industry circles that the EC will continue to allow
shipments, at least through the end of the calendar year, from
U.S. plants that submit to USDA a plan on how they will bring
their operations into conformity with the EC regulation, the
USTR official said.

<TITLE>U.S. BANKS LIKELY TO LIFT PRIME RATES AGAIN SOON</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Martin Cherrin, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Major U.S. banks may lift prime
lending rates again within days due to recent increases in
their borrowing costs and speculation the Federal Reserve is
nudging up interest rates to help the dollar, economists said.
    In what was the first prime rate boost since mid-1984, most
banks in early April lifted their rates a quarter point to
7-3/4 pct, citing a reduced gap between the prime and their own
cost of money. That spread has narrowed again.
    "A prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight,"
said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc.
    Brusca said a quarter-point prime rate rise to eight pct is
justified because the spread between banks' cost of funds and
the prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of a
percentage point.
    He said that spread had averaged around 1.4 percentage
points since last October until it fell below one point and
triggered the April prime rate rise at most banks.
    "We could easily have another prime rate increase as soon
as this week," said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co.
    "We've got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in the
near future," said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.
    "Based on the spread between the prime rate and funding
costs, you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now,"
said Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank.
    However, he said banks may be reluctant to lift the prime
because that would dampen already fairly weak business loan
demand and because some are not sure the Fed will maintain
recent upward pressure on money market interest rates.
    Nathan believes the Fed has let market pressures lift
short-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar. He
said "if there is widespread belief money market rates will
stay high, a prime rate rise could occur at any time."
    Fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep a
dollar drop could help rekindle U.S. inflation. As the dollar
fell to a 40-year low against the yen Friday, currency traders
said the Fed and other central banks supported the dollar.
    In addition to buying dollars outright, another way to
stabilize the U.S. currency would be for the Fed to push U.S.
interest rates higher relative to overseas rates.
    Based particularly on the Fed's reserve management actions
on Friday and today, Nathan of Wells Fargo said "it has become
clear that the Fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressure
in the market. It is supplying fewer reserves than are needed."
    Bank funding costs and other short and long-term interest
rates rose sharply Friday and today on heightened speculation
that the Fed is gently firming monetary policy.
    That was because the Fed supplied far fewer reserves in the
market than most economists had expected.
    On Friday, the Fed added reserves indirectly and in small
amounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements
with the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another
high at 6-5/16 pct. With funds trading even higher at 6-1/2 pct
today, the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 1.5 billion dlr
round of customer repurchase agreements.
    "The Fed's actions on Friday and today show that it is
offering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures,"
said Jones of Lanston.
    "The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the
need to defend the dollar," Jones said. He believes it is
merely shading policy toward restraint now, "but to have a
major impact on the dollar, the Fed will have to tighten policy
overtly at some point."
    Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates by
becoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and, within
four to six weeks, to raise its discount rate from 5-1/2 pct.
    Jones said a U.S. discount rate increase to six pct might
well be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts to
further aid the dollar.
    Given likely Fed policy firming, he said both the yield on
30-year Treasury bonds (about 8.30 pct now) and the prime rate
may be at 8-1/2 pct at end-June and nine pct by year's end.
    "The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tightening
policy to defend the dollar," said Leslie of Discount Corp. He
said tax-date pressures have been pushing up Fed funds lately.
Leslie said Fed actions and reserve data once these pressures
abate will show whether or not it is firming policy.

<TITLE>NOVA &lt;NVA.A.TO> NOT PLANNING DOME &lt;DMP> BID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Nova, an Alberta Corp, chief executive
Robert Blair expressed hope that Dome Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP>
remains under Canadian ownership, but added that his company
plans no bid of its own for debt-troubled Dome.
    "We've no plan to bid," Blair told reporters after a speech
to a business group, although he stressed that Nova and 57
pct-owned Husky Oil Ltd &lt;HYO> were interested in Dome's
extensive Western Canadian energy holdings.
    "But being interested can sometimes be different from
making a bid," Blair said.
    TransCanada PipeLines Ltd &lt;TRP> yesterday bid 4.30 billion
dlrs for Dome, but Dome said it was discontinuing talks with
TransCanada and was considering a proposal from another company
and was also talking with another possible buyer, both rumored
to be offshore.
    Asked by reporters if Dome should remain in Canadian hands,
Blair replied, "Yes. I think that we still need to be building
as much Canadian position in this industry as we can and I
think it would be best if Dome ends up in the hands of Canadian
management."
    He said he did not know who other possible bidders were.
    Blair said that any move to put Dome's financial house in
order "will remove one of the general problems of attitude that
have hung over Western Canadian industry."
    He added, however, that the energy industry still faced "a
couple of tough, tough additional years."
    Asked about Nova's 1987 prospects, Blair predicted that
Nova's net profit would rise this year to more than 150 mln
dlrs from last year's net profit of 100.2 mln dlrs due to
improved product prices and continued cost-cutting.

five to 10 mln dlr suit against a Browning-Ferris Industries
Inc &lt;BFI> unit, CECOS International Inc, caused the stock to
drop today, analysts said.
    The stock has fallen 2-1/4 to 56-1/8 so far today, after
the news about the suit was released this morning.
    "It's potentially a big suit and investors feel that its
not good to go against regulators," Kenneth Ch'u-K'ai Leung, a
Smith Barney analyst said.
    "What investors are actually saying by selling off some BFI
shares is the cloud over this industry is the threat that the
EPA will get tough on waste management companies," Willard
Brown, senior analyst for First Albany Corp.
    "Investors are saying to themselves that waste management
companies have that kind of exposure to regulatory suits,"
Brown said. Brown said if the suit were settled for 10 mln dlrs
it would have an impact on Browning Ferris earnings.
    Leung said, however, that Browning-Ferris has adequate cash
reserves to cover the fine. "It would have no impact on
earnings whatsoever," he said.

<TITLE>HOMESTAKE &lt;HM> MULLS BUYING ORE RESERVES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Homestake Mining Co is considering
acquiring more gold ore reserves in addition to the company's
exploration efforts, chief executive Harry Conger told Reuters
in an interview.
    "We are looking at more options to acquire more reserves
rather than just exploration," Conger said adding, "the move to
consider acquisitions represents a change in the company's
acquisitions policy."
    Conger said all of Homestake's current cash position of 120
mln dlrs would be available to acquire reserves. In addition,
Homestake has two lines of credit totaling 150 mln dlrs which
have not been drawn on today and could be used to finance an
acquisition, he said.
    Conger said he anticipates 1987 exploration budget will be
about the same as 1986 spending of 27.3 mln dlrs. Conger said
exploration for precious metals may be slightly higher than
last year's spending of 17.7 mln dlrs while oil and gas
exploration spending will be slightly less than last year's 9.6
pct.
    Conger said he sees Homestake's 1987 gold production about
the same as 1986 gold production of 669,594 ounces.
    However, 1987 first quarter production from its McLaughlin
reserve will be about 10 pct lower than last year's 45,400
ounces due to start-up production problems.
    He said he believes gold prices will hold above the 400
U.S. dlr an ounce level for the rest of 1987.
     IN 1986, company earnings were based an average market
price for gold of 368 dlrs an ounce.
    Conger said a three pct change in gold prices represents a
12 cts a share impact on earnings but he declined to give a
specific forecast for 1987's first quarter, due to be released
in 10 days, or for full year 1987 results.

<TITLE>HONEYWELL &lt;HON> CITES COST CUTTING FOR GAIN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MINNEAPOLIS, MINN., April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Honeywell Inc said a gain of
20.1 pct in its 1987 first quarter operating earnings was the
result of cost cutting efforts which began last year.
    Honeywell reported 1987 first quarter operating earnings
rose to 43.7 mln dlrs or 96 cts a share from 36.4 mln dlrs or
79 cts in the same period a year ago.
    Better operating results in each of the company's three 
sectors offset higher interest costs in the first quarter due
to financing the December acquisition of Sperry Aerospace and
the sharing of the Federal Systems subsidiary pre-tax profit
with Honeywell Bull Inc, Honeywell said.
    "Our first quarter results show clear benefits of our
restructuring," chairman Edson Spencer said. "All of our
businesses are producing better results than last year, even
though we do not see significant improvement in the external
market environment," he said.
    Total orders in the first quarter were up substantially,
with a sharp increase in aerospace and defense orders in
addition to those of the new Sperry Aerospace group, it said.
    Domestic industrial automation and control orders were
modestly higher than the same period in 1986, it said.
    Orders in Honeywell's home and building automation and
control business were flat in the U.S. and up in international
markets, it said.
    International orders increased, with the greatest strength
in Europe, Honeywell said.
    The company said that by year-end 1987, it intends to
complete the repurchase of 3.3 mln shares remaining of a five
mln share buyback program which began in 1986.

<TITLE>HOMESTAKE MULLS BUYING ORE RESERVES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Homestake Mining Co is considering
acquiring more gold ore reserves in addition to the company's
exploration efforts, chief executive Harry Conger told Reuters
in an interview.
    Conger said, "the move to consider acquisitions represents
a change in the company's acquistions policy."
    Conger said all of Homestake's current cash position of 120
mln dlrs would be available to acquire reserves. In addition,
Homestake has two lines of credit totaling 150 mln dlrs which
have not been drawn on and could be used to finance an
acquisition, he said.
    Conger said he anticipates 1987 exploration budget will be
about the same as 1986 spending of 27.3 mln dlrs.
    Conger said exploration for precious metals may be slightly
higher than last year's spending of 17.7 mln dlrs while oil and
gas exploration spending will be slightly less than last year's
9.6 pct.
    Conger said he sees Homestake's 1987 gold production about
the same as 1986 gold production of 669,594 ounces.
    However, 1987 first quarter production from its McLaughlin
reserve will be about 10 pct lower than last year's 45,400
ounces due to start-up production problems.
    He said he believes gold prices will hold above the 400
U.S. dlr an ounce level for the rest of 1987.

<TITLE>KUWAITI DAILY SAYS OPEC CREDIBILITY AT STAKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KUWAIT, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>OPEC's credibility faces fresh scrutiny
in coming weeks amid signs of a significant rise in supplies of
oil to international oil markets, the Kuwait daily al-Qabas
said.
    In an article headlined, "Gulf oil sources say Middle East
production up 1.4 mln bpd," it warned OPEC's official prices
could face fresh pressure from international oil companies
seeking cheaper supplies.
    It did not say whether only OPEC or both OPEC and other
producers were behind the reported rise in Mideast output. Nor
did it specify if the sources were official or other contacts. 
   "The sources said the credibility of OPEC would come under
fresh scrutiny from today (Monday), with activity in the
European and American markets," the daily said.
    The sources were quoted as saying that after OPEC had in
March demonstrated its commitment to quota agreements, some
members had raised output last week. It gave no details.
    "Dealers in oil markets were now waiting to see if Opec was
able to control production, or whether the days of cheating and
producing over quotas has begun anew," it said.
    The sources warned that "maybe the (price of a) barrel of
oil will fall below 18, perhaps 17.80 dlrs this week or next if
there is no control on supplies," it said.
    "The sources believed a return of oil below 18 dlrs a barrel
may open the doors for international oil companies to pressure
OPEC over contract prices, similar to the struggle last March,"
it said, apparently referring to resistance by buyers to lift
from Qatar unless it gave price discounts.
    "More than one official has warned OPEC would find its
solidarity under scrutiny by the end of April or start of May,"
it said, noting demand usually fell with the onset of summer.

<TITLE>AMERICAN CENTURY &lt;ACT> RESTATES EARNINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAN ANTONIO, Tex., April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>American Century Corp said it
has restated its earnings for the fiscal year ended June 30,
1986 to provide an additional five mln dlrs to its loan loss
allowance, causing a restated year-end net loss of 14,937,000
dlrs, instead of 9,937,000 dlrs.
    The company said the change came after talks with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on the company's judgement
in considering the five mln dlrs collectible.
    In the note to its 1986 financial statement, American
Century said it considered the five mln dlrs collectible,
making its loan loss provision less than required.
    The company said in spite of the SEC decision, it still
feels its allowance for possible loan losses at June 30, 1986
was adequate and that it has considered all relevant
information to determine the collectibility of the five mln dlr
receivable.
    But, it said continued disagreement with the SEC staff
would not be in its best interest.

<TITLE>U.S. AGENCY RULES AGAINST BRAZIL ORANGE JUICE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. International Trade
Commission, ITC, voted to authorize the Commerce Department to
impose anti-dumping duties on imports of Brazilian frozen
concentrated orange juice.
    The ITC voted 3-2 in favor of the anti-dumping petition in
its final ruling on the matter.
    Today's ITC ruling was consistent with the Commerce
Department's final ruling of March 9, and activates an
anti-dumping duty of 1.96 pct on imports of Brazilian frozen
concentrated orange juice, Stephen Vastagh, ITC investigator
said.
    The ITC found that Brazilian orange juice imports have
injured U.S. producers. The Commerce Department had already
ruled that the imports were unfairly priced, and lowered to
1.96 pct the anti-dumping margin that in a preliminary decision
last fall had been set at 8.5 pct, Vastagh said.
    The U.S. government has been requiring bond to be posted on
imports of Brazilian frozen concentrated orange juice since
Commerce's preliminary ruling of last October 23, he said.
    Commerce had ruled that one major Brazilian producer --
Cutrale -- would be excluded from the anti-dumping duty.
    Brazilian imports account for about 40 pct of total U.S.
supply, Vastagh said. Between December 1985 and November 1986,
the United States imported the equivalent of 546 mln gallons of
Brazilian orange juice worth 622 mln dlrs, he said.
    Currently, the United States requires a 35-cent per gallon
tariff on orange juice imports, Vastagh said.
    An ITC spokesman said the agency would forward its final
report on the anti-dumping case to Commerce by April 22.
    Commerce then will process the anti-dumping order and
transmit it to U.S Customs, which will liquidate bond entries
dating from Commerce's preliminary ruling and begin assessing
duties, Vastagh said.
    He said about 12 Brazilian orange juice exporters,
including three major shippers, would be affected by the
decision.

<TITLE>TEXACO &lt;TX> SAYS SOME OIL FLOWS RE-ESTABLISHED</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By SAMUEL FROMARTZ, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Texaco Inc has re-established some key
oil supply lines following yesterday's court filing for
protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankrupcty code, said
Elton Yates, Texaco's coordinator of worldwide operations.
    "Several companies say they are willing to start trading,"
Yates told Reuters in an interview.
    The company last week had stated that a number of domestic
and international oil suppliers were demanding cash for oil
shipments, and in some cases, had cut supplies altogether.
Banks had also cut credit lines, it said in court filings.
    Manufacturers Hanover Corp &lt;MHC> and other banks told
Texaco it would cut off a one billion dlr credit line, Texaco
said in the court filing. Chase Manhattan Corp &lt;CMB> and J.P.
Morgan Co's &lt;JPM> Morgan Guaranty Trust Co asked for deposits
to cover transactions, it said.
    The severe conditions with suppliers and creditors arose
from an unfavorable ruling last Monday by the U.S. Supreme
Court in Texaco's ongoing dispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL> over
the acquisition of Getty Oil Co in 1984.
    The High Court said Texas Courts must consider Texaco's
plea to cut its 10.3 billion dlr bond while appealing the case.
    "Most of the suppliers stayed with us as long as they
could," Elton said. But following Monday's Supreme Court
ruling, Texaco's suppliers began demanding cash and halting
supplies.
    "It wasn't until last Wednesday that it turned into an
avalanche," he said. "Supplies were cut to the point where we
could not run the system at anywhere near capacity."
    He said less than half of Texaco's oil supplies had been in
jeapordy, but the cut off would have produced severe shortages
by mid-May. Now the situation appears much less severe, Elton
said.
    It said that Sonatrach, the Algerian national oil company,
canceled future deliveries of crude oil and natural gas,
Occidental Petroleum Co &lt;OXY> demanded cash for crude, and
Atlantic Richfield Co &lt;ARC> asked for special safeguards.
    The company also said British Petroleum Co PLC &lt;BP> last
week refused to accept an order for fuel oil. But Yates today
said, "a big U.K. company has in fact said they would go on
supplying. They had cancelled last week."
    He declined to identify the company.
    &lt;Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.>, the Venezuelan state oil
company that supplies a large portion of Texaco's oil, also
halted shipments two weeks ago, Yates said.
    But he added that Texaco expected to meet with the
Venezuelans later today in an attempt to reestablish that key
supply line. Talks were also expected to take place with the
Algerians, he added.
    Bankruptcy specialists said it was likely Texaco's chapter
11 filing would allow the company to secure its credit lines
and oil supplies that are key to the company's business.
    "It will be business as usual for Texaco," said Martin
Klein, a bankruptcy attorney at the New York law firm Dreyer
and Traub.
    "Creditors are a nervous bunch of people," he said. "But
when the dust settles they will reevaluate the situation and
will likely extend credit to the chapter 11 company."
    But other officials at Texaco were not immediately
available to say whether discussions were being held with its
banks, or whether credit lines had been reestablished.

was too early to comment on the tax implications of TransCanada
PipeLines Ltd's 4.3 billion dlr offer for Dome Petroleum Ltd.
    "The specific offer by TransCanada is just in the course of
being made and we don't have the details of all the elements of
the proposal," Wilson told the House of Commons daily question
period.
    Opposition parties were questioning Wilson about a possible

the large tax credits held by Dome.

<TITLE>KUWAITI DAILY SAYS OPEC CREDIBILITY AT STAKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KUWAIT, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>OPEC's credibility faces fresh scrutiny
in coming weeks amid signs of a significant rise in supplies of
oil to international oil markets, the Kuwait daily al-Qabas
said.
    In an article headlined "Gulf oil sources say Middle East
production up 1.4 mln bpd" and "Markets witness new surplus amid
whispers of return to cheating days," it warned OPEC's official
prices could face fresh pressure from international oil
companies seeking cheaper supplies.
    It did not say whether only OPEC or Opec and other
producers were behind the reported rise in Mideast output. Nor
did it specify if the sources were official or other contacts.
   "The sources said the credibility of OPEC would come under
fresh scrutiny from Monday, with activity in the European and
American markets," it said.
    The sources were quoted as saying that after Opec had in
March demonstrated its commitment to quota agreements, some
members had raised output last week. It gave no details.
    "Dealers in oil markets were now waiting to see if Opec was
able to control production, or whether the days of cheating and
producing over quotas has begun anew," it reported.
   "The sources warned that maybe the (price of a) barrel of oil
will fall below 18, perhaps 17.80 dlrs this week or next if
there is no control on supplies.
    "The sources believed a return of oil below 18 dlrs a barrel
may open the doors for international oil companies to pressure
Opec over contract prices, similar to the struggle last March,"
it said, apparently referring to resistance by buyers to lift
from Qatar unless it gave price discounts.
    "More than one official has warned Opec would find its
solidarity under scrutiny by the end of April or start of May,"
it said, noting demand usually fell with the onset of summer.

<TITLE>GAF &lt;GAF> SEEKS INFORMATION ON BORG-WARNER&lt;BOR></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>GAF Corp said it is exploring its
options in response to Merrill Lynch Capital Partners' 4.23
billion dlr offer for Borg-Warner Corp, and it has asked for
all information that was supplied to Merrill Lynch.
    A GAF spokesman said the company asked for the information
in order to enable GAF to fully evaluate its alternatives.
    The spokesman also confirmed that GAF did raise its bid to
48 dlrs cash from 46 dlrs per share on Friday.
    Merrill is offering 48.50 dlrs per share cash for 89 pct of
Borg-Warner, and a package of cash and securities for the
balance.
    The transaction with Merrill Lynch will take Borg-Warner
private in the form of a leveraged buyout. Merrill Lynch does
not intend to sell Borg-Warner assets, but it may be forced to
do so in financing the deal, said sources familiar with the
transaction.
     Borg-Warner has said its management is not a participant
in the transaction, but managers will retain their positions.
    The investors involved with Merrill include pension funds,
insurance companies and other institutional investors, sources
said.
    Analysts believe GAF, which owns 19.9 pct of Borg-Warner,
will raise its offer.
    That speculation drove Borg-warner stock up 1-3/8 to 49-5/8
in heavy trading. GAF closed at 49-5/8, off 3/4.

<TITLE>ABU DHABI MARKETING SAID NOT BREACHING OPEC PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ABU DHABI, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>A senior Abu Dhabi oil official said
in remarks published today the emirate, largest producer in the
United Arab Emirates (UAE), was succeeding in marketing its
crude oil without breaching OPEC accords.
    Khalaf al-Oteiba, Marketing Director at the Abu Dhabi
National Oil Co (ADNOC), told the company's Petroleum Community
magazine ADNOC was also keen to keep good customer relations.
"The company will maintain its dialogue with and care for its
customers in accordance with market conditions...And take
necessary steps to guarantee marketing its production," he said.
   "The present oil marketing policy of ADNOC is based on
adherence to OPEC decisions of December 1986 to control
production and establish a new pricing system in an attempt to
stabilize the market," he added.
    OPEC agreed last December to limit production to 15.8 mln
bpd and return to fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel.
    Oteiba said stabilization of the oil market in the future
depended on how much discipline OPEC showed.
    Oteiba said last year, when world oil prices dropped, was
ADNOC's most difficult ever but "a practical and flexible
pricing policy was implemented to relate to the changed market
environment."
    He said crude oil sales last year jumped to an average
609,000 bpd of which 73 pct was exported. Refined product sales
totalled eight mln metric tonnes, of which 67 pct was exported.
    In 1985, ADNOC marketed a total of 476,000 bpd of crude oil
and 7.2 mln tonnes of refined products.

<TITLE>DOME &lt;DMP> BENEFITS FROM TAKEOVER SPECULATION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Solange De Santis</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    Toronto, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Shares of Dome Petroleum Ltd posted
their biggest gain in months in the U.S. and Canada as stock
markets foresaw a takeover tug-of-war beginning for the
debt-heavy company.
    Dome rose 1/4 to 1-1/8 on the American Stock Exchange and
gained 31 cents to 1.44 Canadian dlrs on the Toronto Stock
Exchange, where it was the most active stock. It rose as high
as 1.50 dlrs in Toronto during the day. In recent months, Dome
has normally moved by only a few cents per day.
    TransCanada PipeLines yesterday announced a 4.3 billion dlr
Canadian (3.22 billion U.S.) bid for all of Dome's assets, but
Dome, which is based in Calgary, Alberta, said it is also still
talking with two other companies, which it refuses to identify.
    Market analysts today said the other two firms are believed
to be foreign oil companies, noting that TransCanada yesterday
stressed that its bid is "a Canadian solution to the financial
difficulties of Dome Petroleum."
    "The talk is about Conoco, which is controlled by DuPont
&lt;DD>, and Atlantic Richfield Co &lt;ARC>, which sold its Canadian
interest in 1975 and could be getting back in," said Wilf Gobert
of Peters and Co Ltd.
    David Bryson of Moss Lawson and Co also noted that British
Petroleum PLC &lt;BP> is mentioned as a possible buyer, despite
BP's 70 U.S. dlr per share bid two weeks ago for the 45 percent
of Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD> it does not already own.
    Calgary-based independent analyst James Hamilton has said
in recent reports that Amoco Corp &lt;AN> has also been in talks
with Dome.
    Representatives of Atlantic Richfield, British Petroleum,
Conoco and Amoco were not immediately available for comment.
    Gobert characterized the market action in Dome today as "awfully
optimistic," given TransCanada's offer to give current Dome
shareholders stock in a new subsidiary, which it valued at 1.10
dlrs Canadian per common share.
    Under the offer, current Dome common and preferred
shareholders would own 20 pct of the new subsidiary, which
would own and operate all Dome's former assets. TransCanada
would own 80 pct.
    However, Bryson said the market may be looking at the
potential for shares in a publicly-traded subsidiary. "The
TransCanada offer has quite a bit of upside potential for Dome,"
he said.
    Gobert said he believes the TransCanada offer is "at the
upper end of what I thought somebody would pay for Dome."
    The TransCanada proposal would pay Dome's creditors 3.87
billion Canadian dlrs (2.90 billion U.S. dlrs), with another
one billion Canadian dlrs (750 mln U.S. dlrs) available to
secured creditors if the Dome subsidiary earns profits above a
certain level. TransCanada would not detail the profit level.
    Dome currently is seeking to restructure about six billion
Canadian dlrs (4.5 billion U.S. dlrs) in debt, which it took on
several years ago when oil prices were high and the company
wanted to expand.
    "There has been speculation that Dome's assets are capable
of supporting debt of three to four billion dlrs, so on that
basis, the TransCanada offer would be at the upper end of that,"
Gobert said.
    Dome's debt troubles have often obscured the fact that it
is a major player in the Canadian oil and gas field. It holds
reserves of about 176 mln barrels of crude oil and 3.9 billion
cubic feet of natural gas.
    The company also owns or has an interest in 14.2 mln acres
of oil and gas exploration land in the province of Alberta, the
heart of Canada's oil industry.
   Dome owns or has an interest in a total of 36.1 mln acres of
land across Canada.
   The company also has tax credits of about 2.5 billion dlrs
Canadian (1.9 billion dlrs U.S.). It reported a 1986 loss of
2.2 billion dlrs (1.65 billion dlrs U.S.), believed to be the
largest ever by a Canadian company.

    These rates compared with averages of 5.53 pct for the

pct to 6.10 pct with 48 pct of the bids accepted.
    The Treasury said it received 25.99 billion dlrs of bids

non-competitive bids from the public. It accepted 6.6 billion
dlrs of bids, including 2.1 billion dlrs from the Federal
Reserve and 180 mln dlrs from foreign and international
monetary authorities.
    Some 24.7 billion dlrs in bids for six-month bills were
received, including 832 mln dlrs in non-competitives. The
Treasury accepted 6.6 billion dlrs, including 1.8 billion dlrs
from the Fed and 1.2 billion dlrs from foreign and
international authorities.
    The average price for the three-month bills was 98.488 and
prices ranged from 98.504 to 98.486.  The average price for the
six-months bills was 96.926, and prices ranged from 96.977 to
96.916.
    The average yield on the three-month bills was the highest
since 5.99 pct on June 30, 1986.  The average yield on the
six-month bills was the highest since 6.13 pct on June 23,
1986.

Northair's equity in its Willa mine in British Columbia.
    "Our company is in sound financial position and production
financing can be readily arranged when required. We're not

these guys," Northair said.

downgraded 110 mln dlrs of debt of Michigan General Corp.
    Reduced were the company's 10-3/4 pct senior subordinated
debentures of 1998 to Caa from B-3.
    Moody's cited Michigan's ongoing losses which have impaired
liquidity, weakened financial flexibility and lessened the
likelihood for operating performance to improve.
    Michigan's principal business, lumber and housebuilding
products sales, operates in a cyclical and highly competitve
environment so that even debt restructuring would probably not
improve earnings, Moody's pointed out.

said it expects to report in the first quarter a loss more than
twice the size of the 4.8-mln-dlr loss reported in the fourth
quarter of 1986.
    Convergent reported a first quarter 1986 profit of
2,100,000 dlrs, or five cts per share.
    The company said results declined in the quarter both in
its traditional OEM business and its business systems group.
    The anticipated loss reflects lower than expected operating
margins, start-up costs for new product manufacturing and
higher than planned expenses.

<TITLE>TEXACO FILING ADDS UNCERTAINTY IN OIL MARKET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. oil traders said Texaco Inc's
filing for protection under the Chapter 11 bankruptcy code is
adding uncertainty to an already skittish oil market, but
opinions are divided on the impact to the market.
    "The filing is holding up wet barrel trading today," said
one trader. "Everyone is talking about it, assessing their
company's situations in relation to Texaco," he added.
     Some traders said companies that deal with Texaco are
concerned about whether they will receive payment or supplies
under the bankruptcy filing.
    However, others were less worried. "The first paid will be
the trading community and those connected with Texaco in the
shipping industry," one New York trader said.
    "If Texaco doesn't get crude supplies it can't run its
refineries, so its other assets would not be worth anything,"
he added.
    Texaco filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
bankruptcy code yesterday after failing to reach a settlement
with Pennzoil on an 11 billion dlrs court award for illegally
interferring with Pennzoil's proposed purchase of Getty Oil Co.
    However, others were less worried. "The first paid will be
the trading community and those connected with Texaco in the
shipping industry," one New York trader said.
    "If Texaco doesn't get crude supplies it can't run its

he added.
    Texaco filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
bankruptcy code yesterday after failing to reach a settlement
with Pennzoil on an 11 billion dlrs court award for illegally
interferring with Pennzoil's proposed purchase of Getty Oil Co.
    "There is some reluctance to trade with Texaco but no great
change," said another trader, adding that traders are tending
toward prudence in their dealings with the company.
    Traders are assessing whether to require cash prepayment or
letters of credit, or to continue to trade as usual with Texaco
on an open line basis, he said.
    Another trader, however, described today's activity as
business as usual, adding that traders feel more secure because
no liens can be put on Texaco's assets while it is in
bankruptcy.
    Traders said there was no apparent effect of the Texaco
filing on crude futures trading although they said the exchange
might lower Texaco's position limit and require higher margins
for Texaco's trades.
    New York Mercantile Exchange President Rosemary McFadden
declined to comment on Texaco's futures trading, saying that is
is proprietary information. McFadden did say, however, that as
a matter of procedure, it is possible the exchange can lower
allowable position limits or increase margin requirements for
companies that are in financial trouble.

<TITLE>MERRILL TO GET 30 MLN DLR FEE IN BORG &lt;BOR> DEAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Merrill Lynch and Co Inc &lt;MER>
subsidiary seeking to take over of Borg-Warner Corp said it
could realize a 30 mln dlr fee for its efforts, whether or not
the deal, which it values at 4.7 billion dlrs, succeeds.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc said it would receive a 30
mln dlr fee from the surviving company for acting as dealer
manager of the merger after the Borg-Warner deal is completed.
    But it said it could also receive a break-up fee of 30 mln
dlrs if the deal fails for reasons, which include another party
holding more than 40 pct of its stock or tendering for 50 pct.
    The 30 mln dlr fee is among the highest set down in any
tender offer agreement, either in compensation for dealer
manager services or for break-up of the deal.
    Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, backed by a group of
investors it organized, has launched a 48.50 dlr a share tender
offer for Borg-Warner for 90 pct of its stock.
    The company's board has approved the plan, which was
intended to thwart an unsolicited offer from GAF Corp.
    Borg-Warner also agreed to redeem all outstanding Series A
preferred shares and to pay off on all options at a 48.50 dlr a
share exercise price before the merger is effective, it said.
    Merrill Lynch said its representatives discussed a possible
leveraged buyout with Borg-Warner as early as last December.
    At that time, Merrill Lynch told the company it would
consider a 43 dlr a share tender offer in cash and securities,
if the Borg-Warner board approved, it said. On Feb 24, it said
it was told the company had decided against a buyout.
    But talks were revived after GAF launched its 46 dlr a
share proposal on March 31, Merrill Lynch said.
    Unlike its earlier proposal, Merrill Lynch said Borg-Warner
management was asked not to take part in the new deal and it
was conditioned upon payment of the fees.
    In addition to its fees, Merrill Lynch said it will also
get up to 17 mln dlrs from Borg-Warner to cover its expenses in
the tender offer.
    Merrill Lynch said it would continue operating Borg-Warner
as a subsidiary with its current officers keeping their
positions.
    But for flexibility purposes, Merrill Lynch said it is
considering redistributing Borg-Warner's assets to a number of
subsdiaries of an entity it created to carry out the merger.
    All in all Merrill Lynch estimated that there would be 130
mln dlrs in fees and expenses connected with the deal.
    Another 250 mln dlrs will be needed to repay certain debt
of Borg-Warner, Merrill Lynch said.
    To finance the deal, Merrill Lynch said it expects to
borrow 3.5 billion dlrs from a group of banks and sell 100 mln
dlrs of common stock of the new company, sell 100 mln dlrs of
non-voting preferred stock of the new company to Merrill Lynch
and Co, sell up to 650 mln dlrs of subordinated notes to
Merrill Lynch and Co and sell to the public 204 mln dlrs of
subordinated discount debentures.
    GAF has raised its offer to 48 dlrs a share cash.

<TITLE>ECUADOR SAYS WILL RESUME LIMITED OIL PRODUCTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    QUITO, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ecuador will resume limited crude output
next week to fill up storage tanks as a first step to pump oil
to a Colombian pipeline on May one, the state Ecuadorean
Petroleum Corp (CEPE) said.
    CEPE manager Carlos Romoleroux told reporters that Ecuador
would begin pumping an unspecified amount of crude in
northeastern jungle oilfields at the end of next week in
preparation to send the oil through a new pipeline link-up to
neighbouring Colombia.
    Oil production in Ecuador was halted on March five when an
earthquake damaged the country's main pipeline from Lago Agrio,
at the heart of the Ecuadorean jungle oilfields, to the pacific
port of Balao.
    It will take at least until the end of July to repair the
pipeline and return output to normal levels. The country was
pumping between 245,000 bpd and 250,000 bpd before the tremor.
    To resume limited output in the meantime, Ecuador is
constructing a 26 mile pipeline linkup, capable of carrying
55,000 bpd, from Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon, the starting point
of Colombia's pipeline to the Pacific port of Tumaco.
    The original target date to resume limited crude output was
May eight, the scheduled date for the inauguration of the Lago
Agrio to Puerto Colon pipeline, an energy ministry spokesman
said.

<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, April 14 - </DATELINE><BODY>New Zealand's consumer price index,
CPI, which measures the rate of inflation, rose 2.3 pct in the
quarter ended March 31 against an 8.9 pct rise in the December
1986 quarter and a 2.3 pct rise in the March 1986 quarter, the
Statistics Department said.
    For the 12 months ended March 1987 the CPI rose 18.3 pct
against 18.2 pct in 12 months ended December 1986 and 13.0 pct
in the 12 months ended March 1986, it said in a statement.
    Nearly half the increase in the latest quarterly index was
contributed by the housing group, the department said.
    The December quarter was significantly affected by the
introduction of a 10 pct value added goods and services tax,
GST, in October 1986, it added.
    However, some GST charges not measured in the December 1986
quarter influenced the latest March quarterly figure, it said.
    This is because of an unavoidable lag in price information,
particularly on housing, used cars and insurance on household
contents, it added.

<TITLE>NO TALKS SET ON PROPOSED JAPAN TELECOM MERGER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 14 - </DATELINE><BODY>No formal talks have been scheduled yet
among companies involved in a controversial proposal to merge
two groups seeking to enter Japan's international
telecommunications sector, an official from one group said.
    "Nothing has been firmed up yet," said an official at
&lt;International Digital Communications Planning Inc> (IDC), one
of the groups set up last year to study competing against
&lt;Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd>, which monopolises the sector.
    Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L>, which holds a 20
pct share in IDC, has opposed plans to merge with rival group,
&lt;International Telecom Japan Inc>.
    Under the plan, backed by the Post and Telecommunications
Ministry, Cable and Wireless and U.S.-based &lt;Pacific Telesis
International Inc> would become core companies in the merged
firm, with shares equal to those of the six major Japanese core
companies and seats on the board of directors.
    Britain, angry over what it feels are moves to restrict
Cable and Wireless' role in the sector, views the issue as a
test case. The IDC official declined to specify what was
holding up the talks.
    A spokesman for C. Itoh and Co Ltd &lt;CITT.T>, which holds 20
pct of IDC, said a meeting may be held later this week.

marched to Port-au-Prince to protest against the closure of
Haiti's largest sugar mill and second biggest employer.
    The Haitian American Sugar Company closed on Friday because
of a huge surplus of unsold sugar. The firm said Haiti has been
flooded with smuggled refined and unrefined sugar from the
Dominican Republic and refined U.S. Sugar from Miami.
    The closure idled 3,500 factory workers and left 30,000
small cane planters with no outlet for their cane. The
protesters blamed Finance Minister Lesly Delatour for the
closure, saying his policies have hurt Haitian businesses.

<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, April 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>A 50 pct cut in the import tariff for
soybeans should help boost 1987 U.S. Soybean exports to Taiwan,
a spokesman for the joint committee of soybean importers told
Reuters.
    He said the cut to 3.5 from seven pct was approved by the
cabinet yesterday and would go into effect within a week.
    The cut will encourage local importers to increase 1987
soybean imports to 1.9 mln tonnes from 1.74 mln last year, he
said. The previous target for 1987 was 1.81 tonnes.
    Taiwan imports more than 90 pct of its soybeans from the
U.S. And the rest from South America.
    The spokesman said the increase in imports from the U.S. Is
in line with government efforts to reduce Taiwan's trade
surplus with Washington, which rose to 3.61 billion U.S. Dlrs
in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78 billion a year ago.
    "The tariff cut is very helpful for American suppliers (who
want) to boost their exports to Taiwan," Steve Chen, country
director of the American Soybean Association, told Reuters.

<TITLE>SOUTH KOREA TO CHANGE POLICIES TO AVERT TRADE WAR</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Moon Ihlwan, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SEOUL, April 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Korea has decided on major changes
in its trade, investment and finance policies aimed at reducing
the growth of its balance of payments surplus and avoiding a
trade war with the United States, Deputy Prime Minister Kim
Mahn-je said.
    Kim told reporters the excessively fast rise in exports
could make South Korea too reliant on exports, increase
&#127;nflation and produce trade friction. The policy shift, which
means abandoning Seoul's goal of rapidly reducing its foreign
debt, was worked out at a series of ministerial meetings.
    Kim, who is also Economic Planning Minister, said the
current account surplus, previously expected to exceed eight
billion dlrs this year, would be held at about five billion
dlrs by increasing imports, accelerating market liberalisation
and rationalising exports.
    He said Seoul would try to limit its current account
surplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next few
years, although trade volume would continue to grow.
    "This will gradually reduce the ratio of the surplus to GNP
(gross national product) from the current five pct level to
three pct by 1991," he added.
    Koo Bon-yong, an aide to Kim, said South Korea's foreign
debt had been expected to fall below 40 billion dlrs by the end
of 1987, against the initial forecast of 41.8 billion, and 44.5
billion dlrs at end-1986.
    "But now (with the policy changes) the debt is expected to
remain above 40 billion dlrs, although it could still be lower
than the originally projected 41.8 billion dlrs," he said.
    The policy change was announced two days before the
scheduled arrival of U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige
for talks with Trade Minister Rha Woong-bae.
    South Korea is under U.S. Pressure to reduce its bilateral
trade surplus, which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs last year from
4.3 billion dlrs in 1985.
    Kim said the policy changes were also prompted by the swing
in South Korea's current account to a surplus of 2.06 billion
dlrs in the first quarter of 1987 from a deficit of 438 mln
dlrs in the same 1986 period. First quarter 1987 exports rose
36 pct to 9.4 billion dlrs.
    The government would make foreign currency loans worth 2.5
billion dlrs to firms willing to import capital goods, raw
materials and equipment, preferably from the U.S., He said.
    "The foreign currency-based loans, which carry interest at
1.5 points above LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), are
considerable incentives given to increase imports," Koo said.
    Koo said the loans would be repayable in foreign currency.
"It means they could become interest-free loans if the Korean
currency continues to rise in value," he said.
    He said the South Korean won would be revalued against the
dollar gradually, but added "We do not believe in rapid one-shot
changes in the value of the won."
    The won, fixed at 839.70 to the dollar today, has risen six
pct against the dollar since the beginning of 1986.

of its oil exports to Japan through expanding bilateral trade,
Saudi Arabian Interior Minister Naif bin Abdul-Aziz said.
    He told a Tokyo reception his country hopes to raise crude
and products exports to Japan to earlier levels, but did not
elaborate. To promote trade, Saudi Arabia is inviting Japanese
industries to do business there, he said.

<TITLE>U.S. URGES JAPAN TO OPEN FARM MARKET FURTHER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
has asked Japan to open its farm market further to help
Washington cut its trade deficit and ease protectionist
pressures, an Agriculture Ministry official told reporters.
    Hideo Maki, Director General of the ministry's Economic
Affairs Bureau, quoted Lyng as telling Agriculture Minister
Mutsuki Kato that the removal of import restrictions would help
Japan as well as the United States.
    The meeting with Kato opened a 12-day visit to Japan by
Lyng, who is here to dicuss farm trade.
    However, Maki quoted Kato as replying that Japan was
already the world's largest grain importer.
    Kato added Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Grain and
depended on domestic output for only 53 pct of its food
requirements in 1985.
    Lyng said the U.S. Put high priority on talks on 12 farm
products named in U.S. Complaints against Japan to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) last year, as well as on
beef, citrus products and rice.
    Kato said Japan will maintain its current level of
self-sufficiency and will try not to produce surplus rice
because potential production is higher than domestic demand.
    The world farm market suffers from surpluses because of
rising production by exporting countries, he added.
    Lyng said the U.S. Has been trying to reduce farm product
output with expensive programs, Maki said.
    Maki said the U.S. And Japan will hold detailed discussions
on each trade item as well as a new round of GATT trade talks
at a meeting on April 20, in which U.S. Trade Representative
Clayton Yeutter will join.

<DATELINE>    MANILA, April 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>At least 60,000 tonnes of corn worth 240
mln pesos have been smuggled into the Philippines over the past
few months, the Manila Bulletin newspaper said, quoting an
official in the National Food Authority (NFA).
    The official, who was not named, said a large corn shortage
and corruption among customs and Coast Guard personnel have
jeopardised the government's ban on corn imports, which was
aimed at saving foreign currency.
    The newspaper quoted NFA Marketing Director Jig Tan as
saying monthly corn consumption stood at about 331,000 tonnes
against a national stock inventory of 191,732 tonnes.
    Tan said a continuing drought affecting about 49,150
hectares of corn has led to the loss of 43,725 tonnes of corn
worth 174.9 mln pesos and contributed to the shortage.
    The newspaper quoted Linda Geraldez, an NFA statistician,
as saying despite the drought and the shortage, the total
inventory at the end of the January/June crop season is
expected to be at least 201,000 tonnes.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Washington Post said the U.S.
Commerce Department yesterday issued a new report showing that
the U.S. Merchandise trade deficit was 13.65 billion dollars in
February, a reduction of 1.4 billion dlrs from the 15.06
billion figure the department reported only two days earlier.
    The newspaper said: "News of the unexpectedly large 15
billion deficit helped batter the dollar's value on foreign
exchange markets and boosted U.S. Interest rates.
    "However, the new report went largely unnoticed by financial
markets since such a downward revision in the deficit is a
monthly occurrence."
    The Washington Post said: "By law, the department must first
publish what a top commerce official agreed are misleading
trade figures and then wait 48 hours before putting out the
more accurate ones."
    No one was immediately available at the Commerce Department
for comment on the Washington Post report.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>WORLD LENDING PATTERN CHANGING - MANILA BANK CHIEF</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     MANILA, April 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>International banks have radically
changed their attitudes towards debt and lending and debtor
nations will have to explore new methods of ensuring inflows,
Philippine Central Bank Governor Jose Fernandez said.
    "Commercial banks have tended to be rather difficult in
terms of new money for some time now," he told reporters at a
news conference. "Within the world there are enormous changes
taking place in attitudes of different banks."
    He said the banks were no longer flush with funds from the
post-1973 oil boom and were reluctant to lend money.
    "They don't have the same kind of money they used to have
... They find their whole deposit base eroding," Fernandez said.
Groups of major banks had decided that the international arena
was not to their liking.
    "They wind up with 7/8 (over Eurodollar rates) and who wants
7/8 really? It's nothing. They want to get the frills, but if
they are not big enough they don't get the frills."
    The Philippines on Wednesday announced it wanted to
renegotiate a debt restructuring accord it reached on March 27
with its 12-bank advisory committee, saying it wanted the same
terms as were granted to Argentina earlier this week.
    Argentina was granted a 19-year repayment at 13/16 points
over Eurodollar rates, the same historically low spread that
Mexico won last October, while the Philippines, which had
insisted on a deal similar to Mexico's, restructured 10.3
billion dlrs of its 28.2 billion dlr foreign debt at 7/8.
    Fernandez said the old type of new-money agreement, where
hundreds of banks were forced into involuntary lending by an
advisory committee that negotiated agreements with debtor
countries, was becoming increasingly difficult.
    He said involuntary lending proved useful in the two or
three years since the Mexican debt crisis in 1982.
    "But the present tendency has been that more and more of the
banks, specially the regionals or the small ones, have either
sold off their portfolios or simply by policy will not put up
any more money," Fernandez said.
    He said another disturbing development was the so-called
national quota approach adopted by groups of banks.
    "Groups of banks by nationality have chosen to take a look
at what other groups of banks in other countries are willing to
do and if let us say British banks wind up giving 99 pct of
what is needed and U.S. Banks give only 92 pct, then the
British banks say as a whole they will pull out," he said.
    "There are banks that have decided that lending is not a
good business any more. They want to deal in securities, they
want to go into investment banking, they want to go into the
turnover business rather than the carry business," Fernandez
said. "We have to thread our way through a constellation of
banks, all of whom have different objectives."
    He said in order to survive, the Philippines would have to
try and stimulate new types of inflows, "whether this be direct
investments, whether this be investments by institutions that
now have chosen not to lend but to invest, or whether this be
debt to equity conversions."

<TITLE>JAPAN DETAILS PLAN TO STAVE OFF TRADE PROBLEMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     TOKYO, April 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)
has drawn up a detailed plan calling for large tax cuts and an
increase in government purchases of foreign goods, the head of
the committee working out the plan, Junichiro Koizumi, said.
    The plan will also urge the government to double 1985's
official development assistance to 7.6 billion dlrs within five
years instead of seven as the government had promised, senior
LDP officials said at a press conference.
    LDP executive council chairman Shintaro Abe will explain
the plan to U.S. Officials when he visits the U.S. On April 19.
    Abe's visit is to prepare for Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone's talks with President Ronald Reagan later this month.
    Koizumi said the LDP plan will not specify the size of the
tax cut or the amount of domestic demand to be stimulated.
However, top LDP executives will work out figures so that Abe
will be able to offer specifics to U.S. Officials.
    The proposed increase in procurement of foreign goods by
the government will probably include the purchase of super
computers, LDP officials said.

specific trade problems with other nations and will encourage
flows of funds to developing countries, the officials said.
    The LDP expects the measures to prop up the economy and
lessen trade problems with the U.S., They added.
    The basic ideas of the LDP's plan were presented to and
welcomed by monetary authorities of the major industrial
nations in Washington last week, they said.
    The LDP plan will form the basis for the last of several
packages to stimulate Japanese domestic demand and will be
unveiled by the government in late May.

<TITLE>CHINA TRADE DEFICIT FALLS SHARPLY, RESERVES RISE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, April 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>China's trade deficit in the first
quarter fell to 1.05 billion dlrs from 3.04 billion in the same
1986 period, customs figures show.
    Zhang Zhongji, spokesman of the State Statistical Bureau,
quoted the figures as showing exports rose 27 pct to 7.28
billion dlrs and imports fell 5.1 pct to 8.33 billion.
    He said if imports of gifts, foreign aid items and
materials for joint ventures are excluded, the deficit was only
350 mln dlrs, and the surplus on invisibles was 700 mln. As a
result, foreign exchange reserves increased somewhat from their
level at end-1986, he said, but gave no figure.
    Official figures show the reserves at 10.514 billion dlrs
at end-1986, down from 11.9 billion at end-1985.
    Zhang said one reason for the rise in exports was improved
incentives to export firms, which are being allowed to retain
more foreign exchange from the goods they sell.
    He said first quarter exports to Hong Kong and Macao rose
35.5 pct to 2.48 billion dlrs and imports rose 55.3 pct to 1.46
billion. Exports to Japan fell 2.3 pct to 1.28 billion and
imports 24.4 pct to 2.14 billion.
    Exports to the U.S. Rose 23 pct to 640 mln dlrs and imports
fell 26.7 pct to 840 mln. Exports to the EEC rose 35.1 pct to
770 mln dlrs and imports fell 3.8 pct to 1.5 billion, he said.

<TITLE>JAPAN FARM REFORM A KEY TO TRIMMING TRADE SURPLUS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Linda Sieg, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Basic reform of Japan's protected farm
sector is a key to shifting its economy away from export to
domestic-led growth, a vital step if it is to trim its trade
surplus, securities analysts said.
    The farm sector, which is protected by import tariffs and
quotas, propped up by subsidies and price supports, and
sheltered by the tax system, has ample room for change, they
said.
    "In economic terms, reform would be a plus," said Christopher
Chew of brokerage firm James Capel and Co.
    The ultimate cost of the existing system is food prices
twice those in Europe and two to three times those in the U.S.,
The analysts said.
    Spending on food accounts for about one quarter of the
average household's budget and roughly 10 pct of the gross
national product (GNP), according to a study by Chew.
    Reducing these prices could increase household spending
power by five pct, his study said. The money could be spent on
products which would have a more direct impact in boosting
domestic growth, it added.
    "There's a lot of slack," a U.S. Government official in Tokyo
said. "All that money could be spent on something else."
    Direct central government subsidies to the farm sector
amount to some five billion dlrs per year. Independent
estimates put total subsidies from all sources as high as 37
billion and the analysts said much of that money is wasted.
    Changing tax laws to encourage city residents who only farm
on weekends to put their land up for sale for residential
development would also give a boost to domestic spending,
economists said.
    "Housing construction is the key strategic variable in the
expansion of domestic demand," wrote Chihiro Nakajima, professor
at Kyoto Gakuen University.
    Japanese business groups are calling for staged farm reform
to shift some of the burden of trade friction and economic
restructuring away from the manufacturing sector and onto the
farm sector. Employers groups also want change. "If you really
want to expand domestic demand, the way to do it is not to
raise wages recklessly, but to reduce commodity prices," Bumpei
Otsuki, President of the Japan Federation of Employers'
Associations told a recent press conference.
    External pressures are rising as the U.S. And Europe seek
removal of tariffs and quotas to help reduce their trade
deficits with Japan.
    But vested Japanese interests opposed to change remain well
entrenched, dimming prospects for quick reform, analysts said.
    Although the full-time farm population is falling and there
are signs the LDP is paying more attention to urban
constituencies, the ruling party remains heavily dependent on
farm votes in the rural areas. One rural vote is worth several
city votes due to the pattern of constituency borders.
    The LDP is already in political trouble over its tax reform
plan and does not want to raise another sticky issue so soon,
the analysts said.
    Consumer groups are politically weak and tend to accept the
traditional view that higher prices are a small fee to pay for
national food security, they said.
    Powerful agricultural cooperatives are fiercely opposed to
import liberalisation, but are more flexible about reforms
aimed at stepping up productivity, they said.
    Reform, when it comes, will be in response to specific
pressure rather than an all-embracing program, said Chew.

<TITLE>SRI LANKA AND IMF AGREE ON ECONOMIC REFORMS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Marilyn Odchimar, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    COLOMBO, April 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sri Lanka and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) have reached agreement on the broad outline
of economic reforms, but tough negotiations are likely before
the IMF approves up to 240 mln dlrs in loans, a senior finance
ministry official told Reuters.
    He said the government and IMF this week agreed on a
package to reduce the balance of payments deficit, improve
management of public enterprises, reform tariffs, develop
non-traditional exports and privatise public firms.
    An IMF-World Bank team will visit Colombo next month to
start negotiations on details of a three-year economic reform
programme. "There is a broad agreement on the content of the
policy package for a structural reform," the official said. "But
in areas where the reform would take place, there would be
tough neotiations on how much you do and in what order should
it take place," he added.
    Sri Lanka is seeking a total of about 240 mln dlrs in
structural adjustment loans to support the balance of payments
and in a compensatory financing facility to offset losses in
commodity exports.
    Sri Lanka needs the IMF and World Bank approval of the two
facilities to clear the way for negotiations on requests for
aid and loans from donor countries.
    These include an expected pledge of 550 mln dlrs from from
12 industrialised countries and about 240 mln dlrs in loans
from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
    Finance Minister Ronnie De Mel said in an interview
published today by the Daily News that there was likelihood of
Sri Lanka obtaining all of that aid despite intense lobbying by
pro-Tamil and human rights groups abroad.
    He said that although friendly countries were still
prepared to assist Sri Lanka with concessional aid, Colombo
would have to surmount many problems in detailed negotiations
due in May, June and August before these loans are finalised.
    "In these matters, there's many a slip between the cup and
the lip as other governments have learned to their cost," De Mel
said.

<TITLE>JAPAN SEES HIGHER MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH THIS QUARTER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Japan said it forecast
Japan's broadly-defined M-2 money supply average plus
certificates of deposit (CDs) will rise by about nine pct in
the current April-June quarter against 8.5 pct a year earlier.
    Unadjusted M-2 plus CDs rose a preliminary 8.8 pct in
January/March 1987 compared with a nine pct rise a year
earlier, it said.
    The bank said the forecast rise is due to an increase in
floating deposits due to recent low interest rates and a shift
to private banks from the Bank of Japan of 400-1,000 billion
yen by the recently privatised Japanese Railways.

<TITLE>OECD CONSUMER PRICES RISE IN FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, April 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Consumer prices in the countries of the
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
rose 0.3 pct in February and inflation rose to 2.4 pct
year-on-year, the OECD said in a communique.
    The OECD attributed the rise in consumer prices to the
effects of the February 1986 drop in energy prices working
their way out of the index. The February increase was less than
Janauary's 0.4 pct increase but slightly above the average for
the later months of 1986.
    Inflation in the 24 western industrialised nations in
January was a revised 1.9 pct year-on-year. 
    Retail energy prices rose by 0.3 pct, less than January's
1.1 pct increase. Energy prices for consumers were still nine
pct lower than a year earlier, it said.
    Consumer prices excluding food and energy rose 0.3 pct in
February, in line with previous months, although there has been
some acceleration noticeable in the U.S. And Britain.
    Among the leading seven industrial countries, consumer
price inflation was highest in Italy at 4.2 pct, followed by
Canada at 4.0 pct, Britain at 3.9 pct, France at 3.4 pct, the
U.S. At 2.1 pct and West Germany and Japan with negative rates
of 0.5 pct and 1.4 pct respectively.

<TITLE>LYNG OPENS JAPAN TALKS ON FARM TRADE BARRIERS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Greg McCune</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    Tokyo, April 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
opens talks with Japanese government officials today well aware
his demand for the opening of Japanese rice, beef and citrus
markets is likely to be rejected.
     But in an interview with Reuters during the flight to
Tokyo yesterday, Lyng said the goal of his trip was to throw an
international spotlight on Japan's agricultural import
protection in the hope pressure would build on Tokyo to open
its markets.
    "(The Japanese) have said they are happy we are coming, but
they are not going to give us anything," Lyng said.
    U.S. Officials do not expect any Japanese concessions
during Lyng's two-week visit here. Any farm trade concessions
would be unveiled later this month, they said.
    "If there is anything of consequence to offer (Prime
Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone would take it with him," when he
visits Washington later in the month, one U.S. Official said.
    Lyng plans to ask Japan to open the door to rice imports by
partially lifting the longstanding ban on foreign purchases.
    A private U.S. Rice trader visited Tokyo last week
requesting Japan buy 200,000 tonnes of rice for industrial uses
such as making sake. Japan has rejected the overture, saying
Tokyo maintains a policy of self-sufficiency in rice.
    Lyng will also press Japan to eliminate an import quota for
beef by April 1988 because he believes Japanese consumers would
like to buy much more beef than currently allowed.
    He cited the example of a California company which
transports live U.S. Cattle to Japan by air for slaughter to
circumvent the beef quota. The cost of transport is higher than
the value of the animal, he said.
    U.S. Officials said the Japan Livestock Industry Promotion
Corporation which regulates beef imports, was forced to borrow
from the fiscal 1987 quota earlier this year because the 1986
quota was exhausted and Japanese beef prices were rising. Japan
has said it cannot open its markets to beef imports.
    Along with beef, the U.S. Will also press Japan to
eliminate import quotas on fresh oranges and orange juice by
April, 1988. Some U.S. Officials believe Japan may eventually
be willing to scrap the quota on fresh oranges because
liberalized trade would not necessarily damage the Japanese
mandarin orange industry.
    The quota on juice may be harder to eliminate because
imports might replace domestic produced juice, U.S. And
Japanese officials have said.
   Lyng has resurrected a past U.S. Proposal that Japan buy
surplus U.S. Foodgrains for donation to developing countries,
but some U.S. Officials are skeptical action will be taken.
   Lyng will also urge Japan to put its domestic farm policies,
including rice, on the negotiating table during GATT talks in
Geneva. He said Japan must eliminate import quotas on certain
minor food products or face possible U.S. Reprisals.

<TITLE>JAPAN DETAILS PLAN TO STAVE OFF TRADE PROBLEMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     TOKYO, April 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)
has drawn up a detailed plan calling for large tax cuts and an
increase in government purchases of foreign goods, the head of
the committee working out the plan, Junichiro Koizumi, said.
    The plan will also urge the government to double 1985's
official development assistance to 7.6 billion dlrs within five
years instead of seven as the government had promised, senior
LDP officials said at a press conference.
    LDP executive council chairman Shintaro Abe will explain
the plan to U.S. Officials when he visits the U.S. On April 19.
    Abe's visit is to prepare for Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone's talks with President Ronald Reagan later this month.
    Koizumi said the LDP plan will not specify the size of the
tax cut or the amount of domestic demand to be stimulated.
However, top LDP executives will work out figures so that Abe
will be able to offer specifics to U.S. Officials.
    The proposed increase in procurement of foreign goods by
the government will probably include the purchase of super
computers, LDP officials said.
    According to the plan, Japan will also strive to solve
specific trade problems with other nations and will encourage
flows of funds to developing countries, the officials said.
    The LDP expects the measures to prop up the economy and
lessen trade problems with the U.S., They added.
    The basic ideas of the LDP's plan were presented to and
welcomed by monetary authorities of the major industrial
nations in Washington last week, they said.
    The LDP plan will form the basis for the last of several
packages to stimulate Japanese domestic demand and will be
unveiled by the government in late May.

Baldrige leaves on Saturday on a 10-day trip to the Far East to
help spur U.S. Trade and improve business relations with China,
South Korea and the Philippines, U.S. Officials say.
    Baldrige will also stop in Hong Kong to meet British
officials and local U.S. And Hong Kong businessmen.
    The U.S. Last year had major deficits with three of its

Kong 6.4 billion and China 2.1 billion. The deficit with the
Philippines was 800 mln dlrs.
    Baldrige will meet South Korean President Chun Doo-hwan and
Trade Minister Rha Woong Bae on Monday to discuss opening South
Korean markets to more U.S. Goods.
    Baldrige will be in Peking from April 21 to 24. He will

modern technology to Chinese industries.
    In Hong Kong, Baldrige will hold meetings on April 27 with
Governor David Wilson and Trade and Industry Secretary Eric Ho,
as well as addressing the American Chamber of Commerce.
    U.S. Officials said Baldrige will meet Philippines
President Corazon Aquino on April 28 to show continued U.S.

<TITLE>U.S. URGES JAPAN TO OPEN FARM MARKET FURTHER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
has asked Japan to open its farm market further to help
Washington cut its trade deficit and ease protectionist
pressures, an Agriculture Ministry official told reporters.
    Hideo Maki, Director General of the ministry's Economic
Affairs Bureau, quoted Lyng as telling Agriculture Minister
Mutsuki Kato that the removal of import restrictions would help
Japan as well as the United States.
    The meeting with Kato opened a 12-day visit to Japan by
Lyng, who is here to dicuss farm trade.
    However, Maki quoted Kato as replying that Japan was
already the world's largest grain importer.
    Kato added Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Grain and
depended on domestic output for only 53 pct of its food
requirements in 1985.
    Lyng said the U.S. Put high priority on talks on 12 farm
products named in U.S. Complaints against Japan to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) last year, as well as on
beef, citrus products and rice.
    Kato said Japan will maintain its current level of
self-sufficiency and will try not to produce surplus rice
because potential production is higher than domestic demand.
    The world farm market suffers from surpluses because of
rising production by exporting countries, he added.
    Lyng said the U.S. Has been trying to reduce farm product
output with expensive programs, Maki said.
    Maki said the U.S. And Japan will hold detailed discussions
on each trade item as well as a new round of GATT trade talks
at a meeting on April 20, in which U.S. Trade Representative
Clayton Yeutter will join.

<TITLE>REAGAN TO ANNOUNCE DECISION ON JAPAN SANCTIONS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Robert Trautman, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan today is to
announce a decision on tough new tariffs on Japanese exports to
retaliate for what he calls Japan's failure to end its unfair
practices in semiconductor trade.
    The 100 pct tariffs are to be imposed on 300 mln dlrs of
Japanese goods recommended for curbs by a special panel of
experts headed by the U.S. Trade Representative's Office.
    Reagan announced last March 27 he would impose the tariffs
on certain goods taken from a list that ranged from computors
and television sets to power tools and photographic film.
    The panel this week winnowed through the list of the some
20 products and sent their recommendations yesterday to Santa
Barbara, where Reagan is vacationing.
    In his March annoucement, Reagan said "I am committed to
full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide
American industry with free and fair trade opportunities."
    He added the tariffs would be lifted once Japan honored the
pact it signed last year to end dumping semiconductors in world
markets and opened its home market to U.S. products.
    U.S. officials said Japan had done nothing since the March
announcement to alter Reagan's plan to invoke the sanctions.
    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday:  "we
do not want a trade war, but we feel that this is the kind of
action that requires meaningful action."
    Reagan's move follows steadily rising U.S. trade deicits,
with last year's hitting a record $169.8 billion.
    About one-third of the deficit is in trade with Japan.
    Congress is weighing a trade bill to force the president to
retaliate in certain cases of unfair trade practices.
    He has opposed the legislation, saying it would prevent
negotiated solutions to trade disputes and, in any case, that
existing law was adqeuate to end unfair trade practices.
    Trade experts say his tough action against the Japanese was
as much to penalize the Japanese as to show Congress he did not
need any new trade legislation.
    The Japanese have complained that they have been honoring
the semiconductor pact, but that it would take time before the
results showed up.
    U.S. officials, however, have said their monitoring of
Japanese semiconductor shipments to East Asian countries and
Western Europe showed no letup in the dumping and that the
Japanese home markets remained shut to American exports.
    Japan has said that if Reagan imposed the tariffs, it would
file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade
(GATT).
    It said hoped GATT would find the U.S. retaliation had
violated the regulations of the global trading group and would
approve compensation or Japanese retaliation.
    U.S. officials have said they did not think Japan would
retaliate because it had too much to lose in any trade war with
the United States.

<TITLE>AMOCO &lt;AN> MAY BUY DOME &lt;DMP>, REPORT SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Toronto, April 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Amoco Corp is apparently the successful
bidder for debt-laden Dome Petroleum Ltd, according to a
published report.
    The Toronto Globe and Mail, quoting sources close to the
negotiations, today said Dome broke off talks last night with
TransCanada PipeLines Ltd, which last week announced a 4.3
billion Canadian dlr offer for all of Dome's assets.
    No financial details about the Amoco offer were available
and a Dome spokesman would neither confirm nor deny that Amoco
had emerged the winner, the newspaper said.
    However, the Dome spokesman indicated that the sale of Dome
could be finalized and announced this weekend, the Globe and
Mail said.
    Representatives of Amoco were not immediately available for
comment.
    Last Sunday, when TransCanada announced its offer, Dome
said it was also in talks with two other companies, but refused
to identify them.
    Since then, market speculation has centered on Amoco and
Exxon Corp's &lt;XON> 70 pct-owned Imperial Oil Ltd subsidiary in
Canada.
    British Petroleum PLC &lt;BP> and Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD>
have also been mentioned as possible suitors for Dome.
    In the past two days, Dome management has been pressured by
the federal government to select the offer from TransCanada,
the only Canadian company in the bidding.
    Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government appears to want
to avoid a Dome sale to a foreign company since the government
gave Dome hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks to
encourage oil and gas exploration in the Arctic, analysts and
officials have said.
    A purchase by TransCanada would be least likely to run
afoul of Canadian antitrust laws, however, TransCanada is
asking for tax concessions from a federal government that is
trying to hold its deficit below 30 billion Canadian dlrs,
analysts have said.
    A takeover by Amoco or Imperial would also give a foreign
oil company a dominant position in Canada's oil industry.
    Imperial Oil is already Canada's largest energy company,
with 1986 revenues of 7.1 billion Canadian dlrs. Chicago-based
Amoco had 1986 revenues of 20.23 billion U.S. dlrs. Its Amoco
Canada Petroleum subsidiary is 100 pct owned by Amoco Corp.

<TITLE>FRENCH GOVERNMENT SETS TERMS OF BIMP SALE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, April 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The French Finance ministry said today a
public flotation offer opening this coming Tuesday for 39 pct
of the capital of &lt;Banque Industrielle et Mobiliere Privee>
(BIMP) has been set at 140 francs per share.
    The offer closes next Friday. The ministry said in a
statement 51 pct of the bank's capital had been sold to a solid
core of large investors, including insurance companies and
Michelin subsidiary SPIKA, for 145 pct of the public offer
price. Ten pct of the shares have been reserved for employees,
who get a five pct discount increased to 20 pct if they keep
the shares for two years.
    Employees also get one free share for each one bought, if
the shares are held for at least one year.
    Small investors would receive one free share for every 10
bought, with an upper limit of five free shares per investor,
and on condition the shares are held for at least 18 months.
    The state-owned capital of BIMP comprises 2.51 mln shares.
The bank is being sold to the public as part of a sweeping
programme to privatise 65 state-owned groups over five years.
    In a separate statement, the ministry said last week's
privatisation offer of 1.07 mln shares in &lt;Banque du Batiment
et des Travaux Publics> (BTP) was 65 times oversubscribed.

<TITLE>BUDGET CHIEF MILLER WARNS FED ON INTEREST RATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>White House Budget chief James
Miller said he was concerned that the Federal Reserve might
"overreact" to the decline in the value of the U.S. dollar by
raising interest rates, a move he said could cause a recession
next year.
    "Our greatest danger is overreaction," Miller told newspaper
reporters yesterday. "I'm concerned about the Fed's
overreaction. I'm concerned about what I see in recent data
showing a substantial fall in the money supply."
    Edwin Dale, Miller's spokesman, said the remarks, published
in the New York Times today, were accurate.
    Miller said he was concerned the Fed might overreact to
signals of rising inflation by tightening credit -- a move he
said could have "political consequences."
    The White House budget chief appeared to be referring to
the effect an economic slowdown could have on the presidential
and congressional elections next year.
    "My fear is that if we get into a recession we are in deep
soup, and there is no question about it," he said.
    Miller said an economic slowdown could lead to lower tax
revenues and a widening of the budget deficit.
    Miller's remarks reflected concern that the U.S. central
bank might feel compelled to tighten credit as a means of
bolstering the dollar.
    Both Treasury Secretary James Baker and Federal Reserve
Board Chairman Paul Volcker recently have warned that further
declines in the value of the U.S. dollar could jeopardize
global growth prospects.
    U.S. officials have urged Japan and West Germany to
stimulate economic growth in their countries -- a move that
could boost U.S. exports and relieve trade protectionist
pressures in the United States.

<TITLE>BANK OF FRANCE SEES PICKUP IN INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, April 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of France said in its latest
monthly report on the French economy it expected a pickup in
industrial production registered in March to gather steam over
the next few months.
    Without giving figures, the report said last month's rise,
partly linked to efforts to catch up with production lost
earlier this year through industrial action, was due mainly to
a firming of domestic demand.
    "New progress is expected in all main sectors except capital
goods where production will remain at its present level," the
report added.
    The upbeat report comes in the wake of grim March trade
balance figures which showed a deficit in industrial trade for
the first time since June 1982.
    While the automobile industry remained unchanged from
previously boosted levels, consumer goods production grew and
was expected to accelerate except in the area of domestic
appliances. Semi-finished goods showed a clear increase in all
sectors. Construction and civil engineering, boosted by a rise
in public works, also improved, while retail trade sales in all
sectors continued to slow.

<TITLE>YEUTTER SAYS JAPANESE CURB ALL BUT CERTAIN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter said it was all but certain President Reagan would go
ahead today and impose curbs on Japanese exports as planned.
    Asked in a television interview what the chance was for
Reagan to cancel the scheduled 100 pct tariffs on Japanese
electronic exports, he said "slim to none."
    Reagan announced on March 27 he would impose the tariffs to
retaliate for Japan's failure to honor a 1986 agreement to end
dumping computer semiconductors in world markets at less than
cost and to open its home markets to U.S. products.
    Yeutter, on the NBC program "Today," said the United States
did not want to terminate the agreement and would drop
the tariffs once Japan began fulfilling the agreement.
    He said Japanese negotiators last week told U.S. officials
they were honoring the pact, but Yeutter said it would take
time to monitor any compliance.
    Asked how long that would take, he said "We want to see a
pattern of compliance, so in a minimum I would say that would
take a few weeks."
    Yeutter said he did not think there would be much consumer
impact by the tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods
because the items selected are also readily available from
other countries and manufacturers.
    He said he did not think Japan would retaliate.
    "It seems to me it is not in the interests of either country
to get in an escalating conflict.  The Japanese understand that
full well," Yeutter said.
    He added Japan might challenge the tariffs in the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), but "that's more of a
paper kind of exercise and I don't really expect to see any
adverse impact on U.S. trade."
    Yeutter also said he did not see any way the semiconductor
issue could be resolved before or during a Washington visit
later this month by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.
    He said he hoped the visit, which is to have trade as a
major issue, would be productive but "I don't see any practical
way to resolve this particular dispute before or during his
visit."

<TITLE>ARGENTINA SEES QUICK COMPLETION OF DEBT DEAL</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alan Wheatley, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Argentina's controversial new
financing package should be completed quickly thanks to a wide
range of innovative options in the deal, said Jorge Gonzalez,
undersecretary for external debt in the economics ministry.
    The deal offers banks a lucrative fee if they sign early
and an "exit bond" provision allowing banks to sell as much as
five mln dlrs of their existing loans. Gonzalez also disclosed
that banks will have the choice of lending up to one mln dlrs
in the form of a bearer bond. "We expect to complete the
package very quickly," he said in a telephone interview.
    By providing their share of the 1.55 billion dlrs in new
money being raised for Argentina via an easily tradable bearer
bond instead of a participation in the syndicated loan, smaller
banks could avoid time-consuming legal paperwork.
    The bonds, currently dubbed "alternative participation
instruments," would carry the same terms as the syndicated loan
- a 12-year term, five years' grace and an interest rate margin
of 7/8 pct over Eurodollar rates, Gonzalez said.
    The idea of the "exit bond" is that a creditor bank may
exchange up to five mln dlrs of existing debt for a new,
tradeable bond that bears below-market interest rates.
    In return for accepting a lower yield, the amount of debt
converted will be subtracted from the bank's exposure for
purposes of calculating its contribution to future new loans.
    Gonzalez said it was difficult to say how many banks would
take up the "exit bonds" because no such instrument has been
offered before.
    On paper, however, Argentina's lending syndicate could
shrink dramatically because over 100 of the country's 350
creditors have exposure of less than five mln dlrs.
    Details of the "exit bonds" are still being finalized,
Gonzalez added.
    Argentina has pressed hard for a streamlining of the
lending process because it has bitter memories of its last
package, which was agreed with the Citibank-led steering
committee in December 1984 but not signed until August 1985.
    Gonzalez praised the committee for its cooperation in the
latest negotiations and said the resulting deal, which was
announced by the banks on Wednesday, should put Argentina on
the road to meeting its economic goals.
    "We believe this is a package that will help Argentine to
continue on the track it has elected to follow - stable growth
and equilibrium in the external accounts," he said.
    Asked what role the Reagan Administration had played in the
final stages of the talks, Gonzalez said it had lent "practical
support."
    He did not elaborate, but bankers said the U.S. had pressed
for an agreement after Economics Minister Juan Sourrouille
threatened at last week's spring meeting in Washington of the
International Monetary Fund to break off talks unless banks
stopped blocking a deal.
    The specter of Argentina emulating Brazil and suspending
interest payments haunted policymakers and bankers alike, who
have long feared the emergence of a debtors' cartel.
    "That was a feeling among people on the committee," one
banker said.
    As a result bankers agreed to give Argentina the same
interest rate margin as Mexico, 13/16 pct, on the rescheduling
of 30 billion dlrs of debt, even though they knew this would
raise the ire of the Philippines and Venezuela, which paid 7/8
pct on recent rescheduling packages.
    Asked about the angry reaction of the Manila government,
which promptly said Wednesday that it would demand a spread of
13/16 pct, Gonzalez said this was a matter between the
Philippines and the banks.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ford Motor Co said it is developing an
aluminum space frame for its Probe V concept car using extruded
stretch-formed aluminum that could lead to new techniques for
building production cars in the future.
    It said the frame would reduce vehicle weight and cost
while maintaining structural integrity and crashworthiness. The
frame has fewer parts than conventional steel frames, Ford
said.  The company said the lighter weight would allow smaller
powertrains and suspensions, further reducing weight and
improving fuel economy.
    Ford said in addition, extrusion dies cost 1,000 to 12,000
dlrs each, compared with hundreds of thousands of dollars for
steel stamping dies, and using extruded aluminum the number of
welds in a car could be reduced to about 40 from over 2,000.

<TITLE>U.S. COMMERCE TRADE REPORT OMITS FREIGHT COSTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Commerce Department said on that
insurance and freight costs for imported goods of 1.45 billion
dlrs were included in the February trade deficit of 15.1
billion dlrs reported on Tuesday.
    The department is required by law to wait 48 hours after
the initial trade report to issue a second report on a "customs
value" basis, which eliminates the freight and insurance
charges from the cost of imports.
    Private-sector economists emphasized that the Commerce
Department was not revising down the deficit by 1.45 billion
dlrs but simply presenting the figures on a different basis.
    A report in the Washington Post caused a stir in the
foreign exchanges today because it gave the impression, dealers
said, that the underlying trade deficit for February had been
revised downward.
    The Commerce department would like to have the law changed
to permit it to report both sets of figures simultaneously.
    "My feeling is the second one is a better report but there's
legislation that requires us to delay it two days," said Robert
Ortner, Commerce undersecretary for economic affairs.
    "But this has been going on for a long time and no one pays
any attention to the second figure."
    The 15.1 billion dlr February trade deficit compared with a
revised January deficit of 12.3 billion dlrs.
    The law requiring a 48-hour delay in publishing the monthly
trade figure excluding freight and insurance was passed in
1979.
    Reportedly the feeling was the first figure, which includes
customs, freight and insurance, allowed a better comparison
with other countries that reported their trade balances on the
same basis.
    The second figure, which would always be lower by deducting
freight and insurance, presents the deficit in a more favorable
light for the Reagan administration.
    Ortner said he would like to see the law changed to
eliminate the 48-hour delay in reporting the two figures.
    "We're considering it," he said, "It's one of those dinosaur
laws and I think it's time has come."

<TITLE>BANKS TRY TO CALM MANILA'S FURY OVER DEBT DEAL</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alan Wheatley, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Senior U.S. bankers are seeking to
calm the furore in the Philippines caused by the terms of
Argentina's new financing package, but a source in New York
close to the Manila government said finance minister Jaime
Ongpin is in no mood for compromise.
    Ongpin is angry because the banks granted Argentina an
interest rate spread of 13/16 pct, the same as Mexico won, just
weeks after telling the Philippines that it must accept 7/8 pct
because the Mexican margin could never be repeated.
    Bankers acknowledged the political sensitivity of the
interest spread but urged Ongpin to examine the Argentine
package in its entirety.
    Argentina, for instance, is offering banks a 3/8 pct
participation fee if they sign up for the deal within 30 days
(declining to 1/8 pct if banks commit within 60 days), which
boosts the all-in interest rate it is paying on the package.
    "You can make the case that the deal is not 13/16 pct," one
banker said. Another, referring to the Philippine debt
negotiators, said "The only reason they'd have to come back to
New York is political, not economic."
    Ongpin has said as much himself, estimating that an extra
1/16 percentage point would cost just 5.1 mln dlrs a year.
    But the source close to the Philippines said Ongpin's anger
goes beyond the dollars. He said the minister feels personally
betrayed by bankers who insisted Mexico's 13/16 pct was a
rock-bottom spread that could not be duplicated. Top U.S.
Treasury and Federal Reserve officials had said the same.
    The source said Ongpin is unlikely to come to the U.S. to
press his case and was expecting the Philippines' bank advisory
committee, headed by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co, to
negotiate the spread reduction by telex.
    Ongpin has not said the Philippines will unilaterally start
paying interest at the lower rate but has made it clear to the
committee in a telex that he is not prepared to pay more than
Mexico and Argentina, the source said.
    "The Philippines really means business on this. I don't
think there's much room for compromise," he said.
    Manufacturers Hanover declined to comment on the issue.
    The Philippines last month won an agreement to reschedule
10.3 billion dlrs of debt over 17 years at an interest rate of
7/8 pct, whereas some 30 billion dlrs in old Argentine debt
will be stretched out over 19 years with a spread of 13/16 pct.
    Bankers said they were forced to break their word because
political circumstances had changed in the past few weeks.
    In particular, they said it had become clear that Argentina
was serious about its threat to suspend interest payments
unless it got a good deal. Fearing that an Argentine moratorium
would stiffen the resolve of its neighbour Brazil, which has
already suspended payments, the banks, at the urging of the
Reagan Administration, bowed to Argentina's demands.
    Some U.S. bankers argued that, regardless of politics, the
rich menu of options in the Argentine package makes it
attractive enough to justify a 13/16 pct rescheduling rate.
    "When they (the Philippines) see the whole package, they
may realize that this is not a Mexican deal," one banker said
of the Argentine agreement.
    The Argentine pact contains several features that were not
in the Mexican accord such as "exit bonds," an option to
provide new money via bearer bonds, a trade facility, onlending
provisions and a debt-equity conversion scheme.
    Moreover, Argentina is requesting only 1.95 billion dlrs in
new loans, compared with Mexico's 7.7 billion, and is paying
7/8 pct for most of the money instead of the 13/16 pct charged
to Mexico.
    This line of argument cuts no ice with the Filipinos, who
note drily that they asked for no new money at all.
    "The banks reacted on the level of politics to Argentina
and try to justify it in terms of economics, and now they're
going to have problems with both the Philippines and
Venezuela," said the source close to the Manila government.
    Because of the Easter holidays bankers have not yet got an
official reaction from Venezuela, which is also paying 7/8 pct
on its 20.2 billion dlr rescheduling. But they acknowledged
that Caracas, which was also told that the Mexico spread was
inviolate, is quite likely to demand a lower spread.
    Bankers were more sanguine in the case of Chile.
    Because it is under fire for its human-rights record, the
government of General Augusto Pinochet is unlikely to attract
attention to itself by seeking to renegotiate its recent debt
package, which carries interest of one pct, bankers said.
    They hope that, once tempers cool, the Philippines will
also accept that reopening an agreement that took 4-1/2 tough
months to negotiate will be more trouble than it is worth.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>JAPANESE TARIFFS SEEN AS WORLDWIDE WARNING</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Robert Trautman, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The tough trade sanctions President
Reagan imposed on Japanese exports are not only a shot across
Japan's bow but also a sign Reagan will attack unfair trade
practices worldwide, U.S. officials said.
    But Robert Crandall, a trade specialist at Brookings
Institution, a think tank, said "a shot across their bow can
often result in a shot in our stern."
    He said it left the United States open to retaliation.
    The U.S. officials said the 100 pct tariffs Reagan ordered
on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods will also show Congress
that a tough pro-trade stand can be taken under existing laws,
and no new protectionist legislation is needed.
    In the past year tough trade action had been taken against
the European Community over corn and sorghum, Taiwan over beer
and wine, South Korea over counterfeiting of copyrights,
patents and trademarkets and Japan on tobacco.
    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters the
tariffs - up from five pct - should be seen as a "serious signal"
to other nations on the need for fair trade practices.
    Reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers,
television sets and some hand tools because Japan did not honor
an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at
less than cost and to open its markets to U.S. products. The
tariffs were placed on items which were available from other
sources so there would be little effect on the American
consumer, Fitzwater said.
    Reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action
- especially against Japan - to end global unfair trade
practices and reverse the growing U.S. trade deficit.
    The alternative was that if he did not, Congress would.
    The U.S. trade gap last year was a record 169.8 billion
dlrs, and continues to rise, with Japan accounting for about
one-third of America's overall deficit.
    But there are other two-way deficits - with Canada, West
Germany, Taiwan and South Korea - and Reagan officials said the
president is ready to fight them all.
    Reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that "I regret
that these actions are necessary," but that the health and
vitality of the U.S. semiconductor industry was essential to
American competitiveness in world markets.
    "We cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair trading
practices," Reagan added in the statement from his California
vacation home at Santa Barbara.
    He said the tariffs would remain in force until Japan
abided by the agreement.
    U.S. officials say the action today will show Congress -
which is about to write a trade bill he does not like - that he
already has the tools needed to fight unfair trade.
    The White House aide said of the tariff action, "it wasn't
done to appease Congress, but because there was an unfair trade
practice."
    The aide added, however, "on another plane, it was an
example of how the administration uses the trade law to fight
unfair practices, an that it is not necessary to make a major
overall of our trade laws."
    But the analyst, Crandall, said the tariff action was not
in the best interests of the United States, and that
negotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue.
    "It's very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route," he
said, "because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions in
trade."
    Crandall said, "the administration is doing this for its
political impact across the country, and therefore its impact
on Congress."
    He said, "I don't think it makes a lot of sense."
    But other analysts said it made little difference whether
the tariffs were aimed at U.S. trading partners or Congress,
and that the main point was that the trading partners were on
notice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use.
    Spokesman Fitzwater said "we don't want a trade war," but the
imposition of sanctions showed the United States would act when
it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated.

<TITLE>YEUTTER ALMOST SURE JAPAN WILL NOT RETALIATE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter said he was almost sure Japan would not retaliate
against tariffs President Reagan slapped on 300 mln dlrs of
Japanese electronic goods today.
    "I'd say it's 99 plus pct sure that it (the tariffs) will
not provoke a retaliation on American products," Yeutter told
Cable News Network.
    "Japan has far too much at stake in this relationship (with
the United States) to seriously entertain thoughts of
retaliation," Yeutter said.
    Earlier today, Reagan 
imposed 100 pct tariffs on a range of
Japanese goods in retaliation for Japan's alleged violation of
a bilateral pact governing semiconductor trade.
    Yeutter did say that U.S. farm products would be targeted
if Tokyo decided to hit back.
    "If they (Japan) were to retaliate, it would probably be on
something like American agricultural products," he said.
    "But I really think the chances of that happening are
between slim and none," he added.

<TITLE>PAKISTAN SAYS GOOD ECONOMIC GROWTH CONTINUES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ISLAMABAD, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pakistan says its economy has continued
its recent outstanding performance during the financial year
1986/87 ending on June 30 but areas like balance of payments,
investments and energy were causing concern.
    GDP grew in line with the average growth rate since 1980
and the inflation rate was the lowest since 1969/70, according
to a government economic survey.
     The reform of economic regulation had gathered momentum
and there was an impressive performance in a five point
government program for rural uplift, education and poverty
alleviation, said the survey.
    Ministry Economic Adviser Qazi Alimullah told a news
conference that before recent unseasonal rains and hailstorms
damaged the wheat crop, GDP growth was calculated at 7.04 pct
compared to 7.25 pct in 1985/86.He said the figure might now
slide down a little to around 6.8 or 6.9 pct.
    The survey said monetary expansion was estimated to be nine
pct to date but might rise to around 12 pct by the year-end.
    Alimullah said exports rose 18 pct to 3.5 billion dlrs from
2.9 billion dlrs in 1985/86. But the at the same time, home
remittances by Pakistanis abroad dropped to 2.3 billion dlrs
from the 1985/86 level of 2.595 billion.
    More exports and an improvement in the balance of payments
situation will be required to overcome this declining trend in
home remittances, he said.
    The survey said the trade deficit was expected to fall to
2.4 billion dlrs from three billion dlrs in 1985/86 because of
the boost in exports.
    He said national investment continued to be small because
of a poor rate of savings, about 14 pct of GDP. He said more
savings were required to maintain or possibly step up the
present growth rate and to finance the country's seventh
five-year development plan to be launched in July 1988.

buyout offer.
    Acme said the management group dropped its bid due to
continued weakness in the machine tool industry and in Acme
Precision's operating results and to the inability of the
management group to obtain modifications to terms of its
financing commitment.
    It said, "The effect of these factors led the management
group to conclude that the six dlr per share price was

<TITLE>ITALIAN BARLEY CROP REPORTED IN GOOD CONDITION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Italy's barley crop is generally in good
condition and harvesting is expected to begin shortly, the
agricultural marketing information and research board Irvam
said.
    First consignments were expected to be available around
mid-June.
    Excellent weather, characterised by alternating periods of
sunshine and rain, has encouraged growth except in Sardinia,
which was expected to lose a large part of its barley crop
because of extreme dryness.
    Irvam said yields are expected higher than last year's low
levels if favourable weather continues in the next few weeks.
    Given an average yield of 3.5 tonnes per hectare, national
production would be around two pct higher than in the previous
season at just above 1.6 mln tonnes, it said.
    If yields reach the record 3.78 tonnes per hectare achieved
in 1984, production would be around 1.75 mln tonnes, an
increase of 11 pct compared to 1986.

<TITLE>CHICKEN NOT MAIN SALMONELLA CAUSE, OFFICIAL SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>A representative of the poultry
industry said statistics showed that chicken is less frequently
the cause of salmonella poisoning than beef, dairy products or
salads and other mixed foods.
    Kenneth May, President of Holly Farms Poultry Industries
and a director of the National Broiler Council, told a House
Agriculture subcommittee the incidence of salmonella in chicken
has not increased in recent years and that chicken is neither
the major source of the bacterial poisoning nor the cause of an
increase in outbreaks of the disease.
    May said the Center for Disease Control figures showed that
between 1978 and 1982, chicken was involved in four pct of all
U.S. salmonellosis outbreaks, while beef accounted for ten pct
of outbreaks and dairy products six pct.
    May said the remaining outbreaks were caused by salads and
mixed food, turkey, seafood, pork, eggs and other foods.
    May said the chicken industry favored moving away from
bird-by-bird inspection procedures to a risk assessment system
better able to identify microbial and bacterial contamination
of poultry.
    However, Ellen Haas, executive director of Public Voice for
Food and Health Policy, said bird-by-bird inspection should be
retained and labels should be attached to each ready-to-cook
chicken to remind consumers about preparation procedures
necessary to avoid illness.
    Haas also called for a review of present chicken industry
inspection methods that she said can worsen poultry hazards.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The House Agriculture Committee voted
to make approximately 2.8 billion dlrs of feedgrains deficiency
payments immediately instead of in the late fall.
    A similar measure was decisively defeated on the Senate
floor last week.
    The bill, which passed by a voice vote, would allow
so-called Findley payments to be made immediately rather than
late this year. Payments for 1987-90 feedgrains crops would not
be changed.
    Because the bill would move 2.8 billion dlrs of spending
into fiscal 1987 from fiscal 1988, the measure is expected to
meet stiff resistance in the full House.

<TITLE>LAWSON CALLS INTERVENTION PROOF OF STABILITY GOAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The scale of foreign exchange intervention
the Bank of England has carried out recently is clear proof of
Britain's determination to stabilise exchange rates as agreed
between the Group of Seven industrialised countries in Paris in
February, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.
    Saying he was "content" with sterling's current value, Lawson
told reporters he wanted "to maintain the exchange rate
stability we have all signed up for." He declined to say if he
favoured a rise or a fall from present sterling levels.
 May currency reserves, out today, showed a record 4.8 billion
stg rise, pointing to massive currency intervention.
    In April, reserves rose a hefty 2.9 billion stg.
    Pointing to the reserves data, Lawson said, "We have been
playing a very full part ourselves" in meeting our commitments
toward exchange rate stability as agreed in Paris.
    "We wish to see it (stability) continuing," he added.
    Asked which techniques were available to preserve
stability, Lawson said both central bank intervention and
interest rate changes could be used to tackle "the market
pressures there are from time to time."
    "Interest rate stability is not an objective in that
sense...Rates have to be moved up and down at times," he added.
    Lawson said he expected intervention to be "sterilised" by
draining excess sterling liquidity from the market through new
issues of government securities and foreign currency sales,
when the market allowed.
    This would limit the inflationary impact of intervention,
he said.
    "Sterilisation will be dictated by market tactics...Not
necessarily in the month in which intervention occurs," Lawson
said. "I am confident that we can sterilise on this scale."

<TITLE>U.S. ENERGY SECRETARY SEES HIGHER OIL PRICES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Energy Secretary Donald Hodel said he
expects oil prices to rise significantly by the year 2000,
probably to around 33 dlrs a barrel in current dollars.
    "I do anticipate a significant increase (by 2000).
Thirty-three dlrs a barrel is not unreasonable," Hodel told the
Senate Energy Committee.
    Hodel said the loss of some domestic oil production through
the shutdown of stripper (10 barrels a day or less) wells
because of low prices was probably permanent. He said he was
also concerned by the decline in domestic oil exploration.
    Hodel urged Congress to approve oil exploration in section
1002 of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. He said
geologic condtions in the area were favorable for the discovery
of oil fields equal to those in nearby Prudhoe Bay.

<TITLE>JUDGE TO DECIDE BURLINGTON &lt;BUR> IN SEVERAL DAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Greensboro, N.C., June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. District Court Judge Eugene
A. Gordon said he will decide "in the next few days" whether to
grant Burlington Industries Inc's request to stop a takeover by
Samjens Acquisition Corp.
    "I do not know how I come down on this preliminary
injunction," Gordon said after listening to arguments by
attorneys for 1-1/2 days.
    "It's been a long time since I was deluged with as much
information as I have been. I have to consider what's been
presented and issue an opinion on this. Both sides cannot be
winners," he said.
    Burlington requested the injunction to stop a takeover
effort by Samjens, claiming the partnership used illegally
obtained confidential information about the company to make its
offer. It also alleges there would be anti-trust violations if
Samjens, formed by Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of
Canada, were to succeed.
    Samjens last week topped a 76 dlr per share offer for
Burlington from Morgan Stanley Group &lt;MS> by one dlr per share.
Morgan Stanley made its 2.44 billion dlr bid after Samjens bid
72 dlrs per share for Burlington.
    Burlington lawyers told the court if the injunction is not
granted Samjens would win control of Burlington. A Samjens
lawyer argued that if the judge granted the injunction it would
"kill the offer"
    Jay Greenfield, an attorney for Samjens, said the
partnership would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction
were granted. "There's only one Burlington," he said. "If we
cannot get that then no amount of money can compensate us."
    Greenfield also said Samjens could sell its holdings in
Burlington for 95 mln dlrs. "We don't want that. We're not in
this for the money," he said.
    Irving Nathan, a Burlington lawyer, reiterated that
information provided by James Ammeen, a former Burlington
executive, was crucial to Dominion's decision to attempt o
takeover of Burlington.
    "Dominion relied on the information provided by the insider
Jim Ammeen," Nathan said.
    An attorney for Ammeen, who is named as a defendant, asked
the court to dismiss the lawsuit against his client. The judge
said he would not rule on the request today.

<TITLE>ALLEGIS &lt;AEG> TO SELL CANADIAN HOTELS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Allegis Corp said it has created a
limited partnership to sell selected hotels in Canada to the
public.
    It said the offering is expected to raise in excess of 350
mln Canadian dlrs and will be completed by the end of
September.
    The limited partnership will be similar to the Westin
Hotels limited partnership completed last year when Allegis
sold Westin hotels in San Francisco and Chicago. Allegis
reported a pretax gain of 80.6 mln dlrs as a result of that
partnership.
   
    An Allegis spokesman said the offerings have been in
planning stages for a long time and are unrelated to recent
corporate developments such as the firm's recapitalization plan
and a threatened takeover by an investor group lead by Coniston
Partners and the pilots of its United Airlines unit.
    The spokesman said the company has not yet identified which
of its Canadian hotels will be offered for sale.
    Allegis has 100 pct ownership in Westin hotels in
Vancouver, Calgary, Ottawa and Toronto, and 100 pct interest in
Hilton International hotels in Toronto and Montreal. It owns 60
pct of the Westin in Edmonton.
    Richard Ferris, chairman of Allegis, said in a statement
the hotel limited partnerships allow the company to convert
unrecognized asset appreciation into cash.
    As with the proceeds from the earlier limited partnership,
the money will be used for general corporate needs, the
spokesman said.
    Merrill Lynch Capital Markets and Wood Gundy will be lead
underwriters for to the public offering. The limited
partnership will be offered outside the U.S, Allegis said.

<TITLE>LUKMAN SEES STABLE OIL PRICE FOR NEXT COUPLE YEARS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The current crude oil price of between
18 and 20 dlrs a barrel will remain stable over the next couple
of years, rising only one to two dlrs a barrel per annum to
keep up with inflation, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman said.
    Lukman, who was speaking during talks with Swedish trade
officials, said the stable price depended upon output restraint
by both OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers, Swedish government
officials said.
    They said Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, made
the remarks whilst talking about the connection between Third
World debt and industrialised nations.
    Crude oil output controls did not necessarily mean higher
energy bills for the world's industrial nations, Lukman said.
    Although very low oil prices, such as those seen around the
beginning of the year, may appear beneficial for the industrial
countries that depend on imported energy, they would only lead
to wastage and overdependence on the fuel in the long term, he
said.
    This in turn would bring a swing back to extremely high
prices, he added.
    Sweden, heavily dependent on imported oil, suffered a major
crisis in the mid-1970s, when oil prices spiralled.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>BUNDESBANK CREDIT POLICY CHANGES UNLIKELY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jonathan Lynn, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bundesbank is unlikely to change
credit policies when its central bank council meets on Thursday
for its last session before the Venice summit, banking
economists and money market dealers said.
    The Bundesbank steered money market rates lower last month
by cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts, and is
unlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest rates
in the near future, they said.
    The council will meet in Saarbruecken, and the meeting will
be followed by a news conference at around 1030 GMT.
    But Bundesbank officials noted that a news conference was
usually called when the council meets outside Frankfurt, and
did not necessarily herald any policy moves.
    Bundesbank Vice-President Helmut Schlesinger said today
there was no reason to cut interest rates because money supply
growth had shown no signs of slowing in May and the dollar was
stable against the mark.
    Schlesinger told Reuters in Tokyo, where the Bundesbank has
opened a representative office, that the West German economy
was now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted
1/2 to one pct in the first quarter.
    Money market dealers said call money was likely to hold in
a 3.50/70 pct range for most of this month, after the
Bundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at a
minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, allocating funds at 3.55 pct.
    "They have set this signal and indicated they could maybe
lower market rates even further, but not with the discount or
Lombard," Winfried Hutmann, chief economist of Schroeder,
Munchmeyer, Hengst Investment GmbH said.
    Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said
German rates were among the lowest in industrial countries and
around historical lows for West Germany.
    A further cut in rates would have little impact on the
economy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand,
with companies swimming in liquidity, Chrobok said.
    The Bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a move
on interest rates, when this would be better held in reserve.
"The Bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder," he said.
    A cut in the discount or Lombard rates, to bring them in
line with the new structure of money market rates since last
month, would have little practical significance, dealers said.
    The Bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted a
diplomatic gesture before next week's Venice summit.
    But Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl has often made it
clear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere "eyewash."
    Economists said it was really up to the Bonn government to
cut taxes, rather than for the Bundesbank to ease monetary
policy, to meet pressure on West Germany at the Venice summit.
    But with Bonn struggling to finance already announced tax
cuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budget
deficit, it is hard to see how Bonn could cut taxes further.
    "The Bonn government will be in a very weak position in
Venice because they can't risk increasing the deficit further,"
said Schroeder, Muenchmeyer, Hengst's Hutmann.
    Bethmann's Chrobok said if anything is to happen before
Venice, it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy. "But I
don't expect any convincing measures," he said.
    Money market dealers noted that call money continued to
normalize today, falling to 3.60/70 pct from 3.75/85 yesterday
and as much as five pct on Friday when it was pushed up by
month-end distortions.
    Call money could come under upwards pressure later this
month because of a major round of tax payments by banks on
behalf of customers, starting in the week beginning June 15.
Two public holidays that week could also distort the market.
    Dealers said they expected the Bundesbank to allocate funds
tomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 3.55
pct, after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct,
and to fully replace the 5.5 billion marks in an outgoing pact.
    But dealers said it was possible the Bundesbank would
allocate funds at 3.6 pct rather than 3.55. That would not
represent a tightening of policy, however.
    Because the Bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates
at the minimum accepted rate, some banks may try to get a full
allocation by bidding heavily at 3.6 pct, dealers said.
    On another issue, Poehl has said the Bundesbank is likely
to lift restrictions on private use of the European Currency
Unit (ECU) at one of its meetings soon.
    Saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcement
on this gesture to European unity, as it is the capital of the
Saarland bordering France, and was twice under French
occupation this century.
    But dealers said an ECU announcement was unlikely to come
this week, as a number of technical and legal matters had still
to be resolved, for instance how German ECU accounts would be
treated for minimum reserve purposes.

<TITLE>GERMAN EXPERTS SAY NO FURTHER ECONOMIC STIMULUS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The West German government's independent
council of economic experts believes a further stimulation of
the economy is inappropriate, government spokesman Friedhelm
Ost said.
    A statement released by Ost after a meeting of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and senior government officials with the council
said the experts believed 1987 ecomomic growth of 1-1/2 to two
pct was achievable.
    It added the council believed "an intensification of the
already expansionary stimulation of monetary and financial
policy is not called for."
    Ost's statement said experts believed further pressure on
West Germany to adapt to external economic factors would not
increase.
    The government regularly uses the term "changed external
economic factors" when referring to the fall of the dollar,
which has severely damaged West German exports. Bonn officials
have said they expect exports to pick up during the year, but
could still fall below the 1986 level.
    Along with other leading industrial countries, West Germany
agreed to a package of measures at a meeting in Paris in
February aimed at stemming the fall of the dollar.
    The stance taken by the experts backs up the official
position of the West German government ahead of next week's
seven nation summit in Venice, where Bonn is expected to be
pressed by the U.S. And other partners to boost its economy.
    West German government officials have stressed Bonn is not
in a position to stimulate growth further since tax cuts due
next year and 1990 are already stretching the budget.
    The Bundesbank has also ruled out a quick cut in official
interest rates although it sees market rates continuing low.
    The experts' prediction for economic growth this year of
between 1-1/2 and two pct is a slight downward revision from a
forecast made last November when two pct growth was forecast.
    Many independent forecasters have revised down 1987
predictions in light of the downturn in exports. The government
itself has said it expects growth of just under two pct,
compared with a 2.4 pct expansion in 1986.

<TITLE>EX-USDA OFFICIAL URGES CHICKEN HANDLING LABELS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>A former U.S. Agriculture Department
official urged the department to require that packages of
chicken be labeled with handling and cooking instructions to
protect the public from disease.
    Carol Tucker Foreman, President of Foreman and Heidepriem
and a former assistant secretary of agriculture for food and
consumer services, told a House Agriculture subcommittee, "every
hour of every day, 22 Americans become victims of chicken
contaminated with salmonella."
    She said every two and a half weeks, an American dies of
salmonellosis or complications arising from it and the
incidence of poisoning from poultry has increased steadily over
the past several years.
    Foreman said USDA should follow a National Academy of
Sciences recommendation to label chicken packages to remind
consumers of preparation procedures necessary to avoid illness.
    She urged USDA to require that birds be washed thoroughly
before they are defeathered and that defeathering machines be
cleaned several times a day, that birds be condemned if their
intestines are punctured or there is visible fecal
contamination and that chiller water be changed more often.
    Kenneth Blaylock, President of the American Federation of
Government Employees, said a poultry industry recommendation to
move away from the current bird-by-bird inspection could prove
"disastrous." He said a strengthened bird-by-bird inspection with
slower line speeds was the foundation upon which new inspection
techniques should be overlaid.

<TITLE>U.S. WEIGHS LIFTING JAPANESE TRADE CURBS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The White House has completed a new
review of Japanese semiconductor trading practices but has not
yet decided whether trade sanctions levied against Japan last
April should be lifted, U.S. officials said.
    They said the president's Economic Policy Council looked at
Japan's adherence to the 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact
yesterday and that an announcement may be made shortly.
    But there was no hint what the announcement might be.
    Officials have said the 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs of
Japanese exports could be modified if Japan was found to be
honoring a portion of its semiconductor pact.
    But they also noted that the White House has said it was
unlikely the tariffs would be lifted before the meeting of the
world's seven major economic powers in Venice on June 8-10.
    The officials added that while the curbs complicated
U.S.-Japanese economic cooperation, they did serve to blunt 
Congressional criticism that the Reagan Administrtation was not
taking tough actions to reduce he U.S. trade deficit.
    Reagan imposed the sanctions on April 17 in retaliation for
Japan's failure to honor commitments to end dumping
semiconductors in world markets at less than production costs
and to open its own market to U.S. goods.
    The sanctions were levied on certain Japanese television
sets, personal computers and hand-held power tools.
    Reagan, in imposing the curbs, said they would be lifted as
soon as there was evidence of a pattern that Japan was adhering
to the pact.

<TITLE>ENERGY SECRETARY SEES HIGHER OIL PRICES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Energy Secretary Donald Hodel said he
expects oil prices to rise significantly by the year 2000,
probably to around 33 dlrs a barrel in current dollars.
    "I do anticipate a significant increase (by 2000).
Thirty-three dlrs a barrel is not unreasonable," Hodel told the
Senate Energy Committee.
    Hodel said the loss of some domestic oil production through
the shutdown of stripper (10 barrels a day or less) wells
because of low prices was probably permanent. He said he was
also concerned by the decline in domestic oil exploration.
    Hodel urged Congress to approve oil exploration in section
1002 of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. He said
geologic condtions in the area were favorable for the discovery
of oil fields equal to those in nearby Prudhoe Bay.
    "The area could contain potentially recoverable oil
resources of more than 9.2 billion barrels, an amount nearly
equal to the Prudhoe Bay oil field, which currently provides
almost one-fifth of U.S. domestic production," Hodel said.
    He said production from the new section could begin about
the time Prudhoe Bay production begins to decline in 2000
without endangering caribou or other wildlife in the area.

<DATELINE>    COPENHAGEN, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Denmark's net official reserves rose
to 60.629 billion crowns in May from 48.380 billion in April,
against 39.481 billion in May 1986, the Central Bank said in
its monthly balance sheet report.
    Total net reserves, including reserves held by commercial
and major savings banks and corrected for exchange rate
adjustments, rose to 58.373 billion crowns in May from 47.835
billion in April, against 32.443 billion in May 1986.
    The Bank said in a statement that public loan transactions
accounted for net capital import of 0.1 billion crowns in May,
with net registered private capital imports of 9.1 billion.
    "Of this, the net sale of Danish crown bonds to other
countries totalled about 2.5 billion crowns. There was balance
between the purchase and sale of foreign securities," the
statement added.
    The Central Bank said that figures for private bank
reserves and registered capital movements were provisional and
there was no estimate yet of unregistered movements.
    "It is therefore not possible on this basis to draw
conclusions about the developments of the external current
account," the statement added.

by a tightening in available nearby freight space needed to
move raw sugar to various destinations, notably from Thailand,
traders said.
    This has resulted in a hardening of freight rates in those
areas. These are now being quoted between 12.5 and 17.5 dlrs a
tonne per day, depending on shipment and destination, against
recent fixings below 12 dlrs a tonne.
    Charterers are considering combining contracted shipments
because of inadequate space, shipping sources said, noting 13

    A cargo of Thai raw sugar was reported traded at basis July
New York futures less 25 points for June/July 15 shipment,
traders said. But others said this was old business.

<TITLE>LEUTWILER WANTS FIRMER MARK AGAINST SFR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BADEN, Switzerland, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Fritz Leutwiler, chairman of
BBC AG Brown Boveri und Cie and a former Swiss National Bank
president, urged the National Bank to declare its intent of
achieving a rising rate for the mark against the Swiss franc.
    In a speech to shareholders, Leutwiler said, "A gradually
rising rate for the mark in relation to the franc would be
desirable from the standpoint of industrial exports and with
regard to sustaining Swiss industry."
    "Simply an appropriate declaration of intent by our bank of
issue (Swiss National Bank) could have a positive effect," he
said.
    Leutwiler, who served 10 years as head of the Swiss central
bank, said such a step would not contradict the National Bank's
target of monetary stability.
    "Bringing the franc close to the mark would, of course, have
to be done step by step under the watchful eye of monetary
policy," he told shareholders. "Realistically there is in fact no
persuasive reason why the German currency is quoted almost 20
pct lower than the Swiss."
    A National Bank spokesman said the relation of the mark and
Swiss franc was an example of stable currency parities over a
long period of time.
    The spokesman said exchange rates were made by the market,
not the central bank, and it would be impossible to influence
individual parities separately.
    Leutwiler said the Swiss National Bank could not support
the value of the dollar, even in conjunction with other central
banks, without putting monetary stability in jeopardy.
    "I would be the last to recommend that. The key to a
stronger dollar lies in the United States itself," Leutwiler
said.

<TITLE>SPECTRA-PHYSICS &lt;SPY> MULLS SALE, RESTRUCTURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Spectra-Physics Inc said it is
considering the possibility of recapitalizing, restructuring,
or seeking a buyer for the company following its rejection of
an unsolicitied 32 dlr a share bid from Ciba-Geigy Corp.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the San Jose, Calif., gas lasers and accessories company also
said its board Sunday agreed to a plan that gives 52 top
executives bonuses ranging from 20 to 50 pct of their base
salary if they stay with the company through August 29.
    In rejecting the takeover proposal by the U.S. subsidiary
of Swiss-based Ciba-Geigy AG, the company said it was unfair.
    The Spectra-Physics board voted unanimously, with two
Ciba-Geigy representatives not participating, to reject the
Swiss-based chemical and pharmaceutical company's takeover bid,
citing an opinion from its financial advsior, Morgan Stanley
and Co Inc, that it is "inadequate and unfair from a financial
point of view to the holders of shares," the company said.
    The board also authorized a special committee and Morgan
Stanley to "vigorously investigate, pursue and authorize any
alternatives which would maximize the value of shareholders'
investment in the company," the company said.
    Among the alternatives the special committee will consider
are a sale of the company to a third party for more than 32
dlrs a share, a recapitalization or restructuring, including
self tender offers and/or asset dispositions through the use of
dividends, Spectra-Physics said.
    The "retention plan" for the 52 top officers will pay an
average bonus percentage of 28 pct of salary, it said.
    Spectra-Physics said its board approved the plan "in order
to encourage key operating personnel to remain with the company
during the period of turmoil and uncertainty engendered by the
(Ciba-Geigy) offer."
    Under the plan, the executives would be entitled to their
cash bonuses if they stay with the company through August 29,
but could receive them earlier if they are fired for reasons
other than gross and willful misconduct, or if they leave the
company because their salaries have been sharply cut.
    Spectra-Physics also said it filed suit against Ciba-Geigy
yesterday in U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Del., charging
it with making a takeover bid that was false and misleading in
violation of securities law and with violating the intent of
July 9, 1985 standstill agreement.
    Spectra-Physics said Ciba-Geigy indicated at the time of
the standstill agreement that it would not make an unsolicited
takeover proposal for the company and that the intent of the
agreement was that Ciba-Geigy would not acquire more than 20
pct of the company unless there was another takeover threat.
    Ciba-Geigy was 18.8 pct of Spectra-Physics and Reliance
Group Holdings &lt;REL>, which is controlled by New York investor
Saul Steinberg, controls 12.8 pct.
    Spectra-Physics said the agreement prevents Ciba-Geigy from
raising its stake beyond 20 pct through Jan 1, 1992, unless
another person get more than 10 pct of its voting power.

<TITLE>VOLCKER DEPARTURE REVIVES DLR, INFLATION FEARS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    by Jeremy Solomons, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    New York, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Paul Volcker's decision not to go for a
third term as Federal Reserve Chairman and the nomination of
Alan Greenspan to replace him have revived deep concerns about
the U.S.' ability to prevent a further dollar decline and stem
rising inflation, financial market analysts said.
    Although Greenspan is known as a committed anti-inflation
fighter in the Volcker mould, doubts are already surfacing in
the U.S. financial markets as to whether he has enough
political clout and monetary experience to wage a tough
campaign against inflation over the next year or two.
    "The critical issue is how (Greenspan) will deal with
inflation," said Stephen Axilrod, Vice Chairman of Nikko
Securities Co International Inc and former staff director for
monetary and financial policy at the Fed.
    "A lot of questions have been raised by Volcker's
departure. Until Greenspan answers them, the markets will
remain nervous," added Stephen Slifer, money market economist
at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc.
    This morning's announcement sent the dollar into a
tailspin, which was halted only by concerted central bank
intervention in the open currency market.

<TITLE>ROYAL BANK (RY.TO) RECLASSIFIES BRAZIL LOANS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Royal Bank of Canada said it classified
1.3 billion dlrs in medium and long-term loans to Brazil as
non-accrual, leading to a seven pct drop in second quarter
profit.
    "The designation of these loans as non-accrual reduced the
bank's earnings by about 22 mln dlrs after tax," chairman Allan
Taylor said in a statement. "Without this reduction,
second-quarter earnings would have been about 138 mln dlrs," a
10 pct increase over last year's profit, Taylor said.
    The bank earlier reported second quarter profit fell to
116.2 mln dlrs from 125.1 mln dlrs a year ago.
    The bank said domestic earnings rose to a record 125 mln
dlrs in the second quarter, a 52 mln dlr increase from the year
before, due to higher business volumes and securities gains as
well as a better yield from its domestic non-accrual loan
portfolio.
    It said international operations reported a net after-tax
loss of nine mln dlrs, compared with a 52 mln dlr profit last
year. The decline largely reflects the impact of Brazil's
suspended interest payments, which resulted in about a 40 mln
dlr reduction in net interest income, Royal Bank said.
    Royal Bank said it keeping its 1987 loan loss experience
estimate unchanged from the last quarter at one billion dlrs.
It said it is committed to building its general provision for
loan losses to at least 20 pct of total outstanding loans to
troubled sovereign borrowers by the end of 1989.
    The bank said non-accrual loans totalled 3.3 billion dlrs
at April 30--1.5 billion in domestic loans and 1.8 billion in
international loans. Excluding the 1.3 billion dlrs in loans to
Brazil, net non-accrual loans at the end of the second quarter
declined 200 mln dlrs over the 1987 first quarter, it said.

<TITLE>SMALL RISE SEEN IN U.S. GASOLINE INVENTORIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. analysts expect the American
Petroleum Institute's weekly report on oil inventories to show
a slight build in U.S. stocks of gasoline for the week ended
May 29, oil traders and analysts said.
    While the consensus is for an increase, a few would not
rule out the possibility of an decline. Traders said that
barring any surprises in tonight's report, they expect the
report to be neutral to bearish for oil prices.
    Heating oil stocks are also likely to build and runs to be
steady to slightly higher, which could add pressure on oil
prices, the analysts said.
    Crude oil was seen likely to build assuming imports
continue at relatively high levels.
    Analysts expect gasoline stocks to rise 500,000 to two mln
barrels above the 234 mln reported for May 22.
    Peter Beutel, oil analyst with Elders Futures inc, who
looks for a build said, "We have had five weeks of gasoline
demand at 7.3 mln bpd or more and it is likely to taper off to
between 6.7-7.0 mln bpd, which should make stocks build. Demand
would have to stay above 7.0 mln bpd to have a draw," he added.
    Rising demand is why oil traders and analysts expect a draw
in stocks of about of about one mln barrels.
   
    The U.S. Energy Information Administration in its latest
report for the four weeks ending may 22 said that gasoline
demand was up 4.4 pct to 7.3 mln bpd from the previous year.
    But analysts said hopes of reduced stocks is likely to
founder on increased runs in refineries, which could be up 0.3
pct above May 22's 81.2 pct capacity operated.
    Such an increase would raise runs about 100,000 bpd and add
to U.S. stocks.
    But some analysts said that refiners may have held refinery
runs.
    Heating oil stocks were also expected to build between
700,000 barrels and one mln from the 96 mln barrel level
reported last week, but a rise in distillate stocks was
discounted as having a market impact at this time.
    "A build is seasonal now and not out of line with last year,"
one futures analyst said.
    Analysts said they also expect crude oil stocks to build
between 1.5 mln barrels and three mln from the 325 mln barrels
reported by API for the week of may 22.
    The consensus appears for about two mln barrels to be added
to the nation's inventory.

<TITLE>SHULTZ WELCOMES TOKYO ECONOMIC PACKAGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said
the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by Tokyo last
week went further than the U.S. Had expected.
    But he said the U.S. Would not lift the selective economic
sanctions it imposed on Japanese imports in April until Tokyo
changed its sales policies concerning computer microchips.
    Speaking in a televised news conference linking several
European capitals, Shultz said it was heartening that the
Japanese had confronted the problem of stimulating domestic and
global demand.

    "There is an even greater amount of stimulus than was
originally thought," said Shultz, speaking from Washington.
    "It is a lot more than nothing. It is more than was talked
about when (Prime Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone was here.
    "It involves a major reduction in tax rates and we believe
that getting the tax burden down is one way of stimulating the
economy," he added.
    But asked by Japanese reporters, also linked into the news
conference, whether the positive reaction meant the U.S. Might
decide at next week's Venice summit to lift its sanctions on
some Japanese electronic goods, Shultz replied:
    "These sanctions were undertaken on the basis of an
agreement that had been reached between the United States and
Japan on various sale practices and prices relating to the chip
market.
    "They will be lifted as the facts of change by Japan to the
agreement that it made become evident."
    He said U.S. Officials had only been able to monitor the
situation for a month and that it was impossible to determine a
trend on only one month's data.
    The U.S. Imposed 100 pct import duties on personal
computers, colour televisions and power tools, alleging that
Japan had violated last September's bilateral agreement by
selling computer chips at below fair market value.
    Shultz said West Germany and other nations would also do
well to look at what they could do to stimulate demand.
    Asked whether the U.S. Could reasonably ask its allies to
take action to stimulate the world economy without a bold
American initiative to reduce the size of the federal budget
deficit, Shultz said moves were already underway to tackle the
problem.
    He said by the end of the current fiscal year the deficit
would probably be reduced by around 35 billion dlrs against
last year, and that the budget being worked on this year would
contain a major reduction.

community in Commerce Township, Michigan, for a pre-tax gain of

    The company said the sales proceeds will be partly used to

development of communities requiring significant equity and
having lengthy projected life cycles.
    The company also said along with local landowners and
investors, it will acquire 33-acre tract Northtowne Meadows in
the Toledo, Ohio, area for development into 160 home sites and
three acres of commercial land.

<TITLE>ACP STATES SAY EC OILS TAX PLAN BREAKS ACCORDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Developing countries said the European
Community (EC) would breach two international agreements if it
went ahead with its plans for an oils and fats tax.
    Ambassadors to the EC from African, Caribbean and Pacific
(ACP) states told a press conference the tax would hit the
exports of 26 ACP countries.
    They said the EC failed to follow consultation procedures
laid down in the Lome Convention which regulates relations
between ACP states and the bloc for moves which could affect
trade between the two sides.
    They also said the EC would be in breach of an undertaking
not to bring in new protectionist measures during the current
Punta del Este round of world trade negotiations being held
under GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) auspices.
    The EC Commission has proposed a tax of up to 330 European
currency units (Ecus) a tonne on both imported and EC-produced
vegetable and marine fats for human consumption, which could
raise up to two billion Ecus a year.
    EC farm ministers, who would have to approve such a tax,
are split on the issue and are expected to decide it at a
marathon meeting on EC farm prices beginning in Luxembourg on
June 15.
    Jamaican ambassador Leslie Wilson said ACP countries are
convinced this would lead to EC industry substituting products
made within the bloc for oil and fat imports. The ACP estimates
this would result in a fall of 160 to 185 mln Ecus in its
member country exports.
    "We can't believe the EC would willingly take measures to
undermine our countries, but such would be the impact of these
measures," Wilson said.
    The U.S. and Malaysia say their exports would also be hit
by the proposed tax and they may take retaliatory action if it
is approved.
    Wilson said the ACP would take such steps only "as a very
last resort," but added that the ACP is in touch with other
countries which oppose the plan.
    Wilson, who was chairing the news conference, made it clear
Jamaica itself would not be hit by the tax as it does not
export oils and fats.
    Among the worst hit countries would be Ivory Coast,
Senegal, Nigeria and Papua New Guinea, the ACP says.

<DATELINE>    VANCOUVER, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Skyline Explorations Ltd said expects
construction can begin next month on a gold mine at Johnny
Mountain Camp, located 600 miles north of Vancouver.
    The company said a contract has been let for a 200 to 400
tons per day mill and the company is receiving cooperation from
provincial and federal agencies on its stage one report,
"approval in principal," which is required before actual
construction can begin.
    Skyline said it is optimistic the approval in principal
will be received in late June, by which time it expects to have
confirmed threshold tonnage and grade targets so construction
can begin in July.
   
    Skyline said the 1987 exploration drift on 16 vien east at
Johnny Mountain has advanced 320 feet. The vein is continuous,
averaging four feet thick plus an altered mineralized hanging
wall.
    It said periodic face samples indicate an average grade of
1.05 ounces per ton of ore ranging from a low of 0.78 ounce per
ton to a high of 55.8 ounces per ton.

<TITLE>SOYCOMPLEX COULD RALLY ON TIGHT U.S. FEED SUPPLY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Nearby months in soybean and soymeal
futures could post a short-term rally on tightening supply of
livestock feed, even if favorable growing conditions keep the
new crop outlook bearish, traders said.
    "A lot of soymeal dealers are just getting very worried
about where processors will get their soybeans this Summer,"
one Illinois soyproduct dealer said.
    Processors are competing vigorously with river dealers for
the few soybeans being offered by country elevators, with a
Decatur, Illinois processor raising its spot soybean basis bid
another two cents today to 10 over July futures.
    Farmer marketings of old crop soybeans continue very light,
with flat prices apparently well below levels they are willing
to sell, dealers said.
    Some terminal elevator operators are coming to the belief
that even if futures rally back to last month's highs, country
movement may remain light because farmers in many areas are
sold out of old crop soybeans, particularly in the eastern half
of the Midwest.
    Soybean processors will continue to take seasonal downtime
for maintenance if soybeans remain difficult to buy, reducing
the weekly soybean crush rate still further and keeping the
spot soymeal basis strong, dealers said.
    Futures traders said tight cash supplies should help July
soybeans and soymeal gain on deferreds. July soymeal has
already moved to a premium over the August through October
months and old crop July/new crop November soybeans may also
move to a July premium later this month, they added.

<TITLE>KAUFMAN SAYS GREENSPAN NOMINATION BAD FOR BONDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Henry Kaufman, managing director of
Salomon Brothers Inc, said the nomination of economist Alan
Greenspan to replace Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul
Volcker is bearish in the near term for the fixed income and
currency markets.
    "The basic direction of interest rates is not changed. The
fundamental direction of interest rates continues to be upward,
interrupted by intermittent rallies," Kaufman said in a
statement. He said the implication for equity markets in
neutral to bullish.
    Kaufman said, "Unlike Paul Volcker, who entered the office
of the Federal Reserve chairman with strong credibility both
domestically and internationally, Mr Greenspan will have to
demonstrate both his competence and policy independence before
he can gain full confidence of the financial markets."
    Greenspan is most knowledgeable on the behavior of the U.S.
economy, while his professional skills in the international
area are much more limited, Kaufman noted.
    "Consequently, although he is well known abroad, his views
on issues such as the Less Developed Country Debt may initially
carry less weight than have those of Mr Volcker."

<TITLE>MAJOR U.S. PIPELINE MAY BE CLOSED SEVERAL DAYS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By BERNICE NAPACH, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The operator of a major U.S. crude oil
pipeline, shutdown because of flood damage, said it may be
several days before repairs are made and the system is
functioning again.
    Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at
Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, operator of the pipeline through its
subsidiary Texaco Pipeline Co, said the company hopes repairs
will begin in about five days and expects it to take several
more days to complete.
    "At this point we are lining up what we know we need, to get
the job done," Stevens said, adding that the timing for repairs
will depend on the damage to the pipeline which is difficult to
assess because of flooding on the Red River.
    The pipeline was shipping roughly 225,000 barrels of crude
oil per day, or about 55 pct of its capacity during the 30 days
preceding its shutdown on Saturday, Stevens said.
    The pipeline was shut down from Cushing, Okla, to Witchita
Falls, Kan, on Saturday due to an undetermined leak at the Red
River crossing, near the Oklahoma/Texas border, because of
severe rains, a spokesman for Texaco said.
    Stevens said it was reasonable to suggest the pipeline
could operate at full capacity when it reopens in order to make
up for the shortfull but cautioned they will talk with
customers to determine their requirements.
    Oil analysts and traders said they were not sure if the 
shutdown will continue to raise U.S. oil prices.
    Monday, after Texaco confirmed that the pipeline had been
closed, West Texas Intermediate crude in the spot market and on
New York Mercantile Exchange's energy futures complex rose 20
cts a barrel.

a share in cash, 4.50 dlrs in subordinated debentures and a 1/4

<TITLE>OVERSEAS &lt;OSG> SEES OPEC QUOTAS KEY TO RATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Overseas Shipholding Group Inc president
Morton Hyman said if oil production by OPEC rises during the
second half of 1987, freight rates for tankers should rise
accordingly.
    Hyman, delivering a speech at the annual shareholders
meeting, said international tanker markets were generally weak
throughout the first quarter, but since the end of March OPEC
oil production has picked up. The result has been a modest
improvement in tanker rates.
    Overseas said 73 pct of its fleet handles liquid cargo.
   
    He said tanker requirements decreased in September 1986 as
OPEC production quotas dropped and levels of oil stocks rose.
    For the first quarter 1987, the company reported net income
of 10.3 mln dlrs, or 40 cts per share, compared to 9.3 mln
dlrs, or 36 cts per share, for the comparable quarter a year
ago.
    The company reported net income for 1986 of 37.3 mln dlrs,
or 1.45 dlrs per share.
   
    "The improvement in the company's 1986 results, after four
years of declining earnings, reflects a sharp, albeit
temporary, rise in freight rates in the international tanker
markets last summer," Hyman said.
    He said the Alaskan oil trade continues to be the principal
source of employment for its U.S. flag tanker fleet, which
represents approximately 15 pct of the company's tonnage.
    Overseas owns and operates 67 vessels.

<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Quebec government said it joined
with B.F. Goodrich Canada Inc to study the feasability of
building a vinyl chloride monomer plant in Montreal. The plant
would supply manufacturers of PVC construction and other
materials in Eastern Canada and the Northeastern U.S.,
government officials said.
    Theys said the  plant would cost about 125 mln Canadian
dlrs, with production beginning in 1991 if economic conditions
are right. more
    The Quebec government has said it wants the project to
proceed because it would provide future demand for Petromont
Inc petrochemical products. Petromont is jointly owned by Union
Carbide Canada Ltd &lt;UCC.TO> and the Quebec government's SGF
industrial development group. Its Montreal plant would provide
ethylene as a raw material for the project.
     Quebec said it also wants Interprovincial Pipe Line Ltd
&lt;IPIPF.O> to adapt its pipeline from Sarnia, Ont., to Montreal
to carry natural gas liquids, a decision that will be made by
the federal National Energy Board. It said the pipeline could
provide Petromont with feedstock at one-third the cost of
moving it by rail.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The buffer stock manager of the
International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) will tender for about
3,000 tonnes of cocoa beans Wednesday, June 3, the ICCO said in
a statement.
    It said all other conditions remain unchanged from the
previous announcement.
    These conditions are that offers from registered companies
should be in pounds sterling for cocoa beans for which standard
differentials have been set in the ICCO's buffer stock rules,
and can be for cocoa afloat through to December shipment and
spot to December arrival/delivery.
    The basis position will be afloat, May/July shipment or
June arrival/delivery. For later positions the appropriate
carrying costs will be taken into account.
    The deadline for the receipt of offers by the manager shall
be 1330 hrs london time (1230 gmt) in the case of offers
emanating from the secondhand market and 1400 hours in the case
of offers emanating from the origins.
    The competitiveness of offers will be assessed by taking
into account the standard differentials, the cost of taking
cocoa into store (currently 23.00 pounds sterling from "cif
landed" and 38.00 pounds sterling from "cif shipping weights"
to "in store") and the cost of carry which currently is 12.00
pounds sterling per month, the ICCO said.
    No more than four offers will be considered from each
offering party, it added.

<DATELINE>    LYON, France, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Two people were missing and six
injured after tanks containing thousands of cubic metres of
fuel burst into flames today at a Shell storage unit in Lyon,
rescue workers said.
    The blaze broke out with an explosion around 1330 local
time (1130 GMT). Shell is a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell
Group &lt;RD>.
    Some 200 firemen fought the flames at the gasoline storage
unit at Edouard Herriot riverside port complex and appeared to
have the blaze under control as night fell. The entire southern
section of Lyon was cordoned off.
    The fire destroyed five giant tanks and threatened four
others, the Shell spokesman said. He said that the company
estimated between six and seven thousand cubic metres of
domestic fuel oil, gasoline and additives had been burned.
    The total capacity of the burning tanks was over 10,000
cubic metres, but some had been empty when an explosion started
today's fire, he added.

<TITLE>PAY 'N PAK &lt;PNP> RECEIVES AMENDED PROPOSAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KENT, Wash., June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pay 'N Pak Stores Inc said it
received a revision to one of the two previously disclosed
proposals to buy the company.
    Pay 'N Pak said that the proposal from a leveraged buyout
firm had been amended to increase the dividend rate on the
cumulative preferred stock to be received by PNP shareholders
from 13.5 pct to 17.5 pct.
    As previoiusly announced, the proposal calls for a
transaction in which PNP shareholders would receive a
combination of 17.50 dlrs in cash and 2.50 dlrs in liquidation
value of cumulative preferred stock for each common share.
   
    Under the other proposal received from Paul Bilzerian, PNP
shareholders would receive on a blended basis 16.67 dlrs in
cash and 3.33 dlrs in liquidation value of cumulative
redeemable preferred stock for each common share, the company
said.
    Under the Bilzerian proposal, the dividend rate on the
preferred stock would be set so that in the joint opinion of
the financial advisor to Bilzerian and the financial advisor to
Pay 'N Pak, the preferred stock would trade at its liquidation
value on a fully distributed basis, the company said.

<TITLE>U.S. TO PROTECT ONLY AMERICAN SHIPS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. military forces in the Mideast
Gulf are under orders to protect only American flag vessels and
occasional U.S. arms deliveries on other ships to
"non-belligerent" states in the area, the Pentagon said today.
    "No one has ever stated or supported a policy of protecting
all shipping in those waters," Pentagon spokesman Bob Sims said
as the Reagan Administration drew up plans to increase the
protective U.S. military presence in the gulf.
    Sims denied published reports that U.S. Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger sought air cover to protect all neutral
shipping in the western gulf from attacks by Iran and Iraq.
    "As we have said repeatedly, only American flag vessels are
under our protection with the exception, on a limited
case-by-case basis, of ships carrying our Foreign Military
Sales equipment to friendly, non-belligerent states in the
region," Sims said.
    U.S. warships in the gulf two weeks ago protected a Kuwaiti
ship which sailed to Bahrain with U.S. arms for Bahrain and
Kuwait. But Sims said Washington had received assurances that
the the arms would not be used elsewhere.
    He said Kuwait, which is turning 11 oil tankers over to
U.S. firms to fly the American flag and be protected by the
U.S. warships, is not considered a belligerent despite Iranian
charges that Kuwait is supporting Iraq in the gulf war.
    Kuwaiti tankers have come under repeated Iranian attack.
    Sims refused to say how the United States will beef up its
seven-ship Middle East Task Force in the gulf to protect the 11
Kuaiti tankers. But Pentagon officials said that additional
ships and air cover are under consideration.

<TITLE>HOLLLINGER &lt;HLG.TO> PAYING 50 MLN DLRS FOR BUY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hollinger Inc will pay about 50 mln dlrs
cash for its previously reported acquisition of privately owned
Unimedia Inc, chairman Conrad Black told reporters after the
annual meeting, confirming a published report.
    Commenting on press reports about the 50 mln dlr price tag,
Black said, "That would not be wildly inaccurate," although he
declined to disclose the actual cost.
    Montreal-based Unimedia is Quebec's third largest newspaper
group, with three French language daily newspapers in Quebec
City, Ottawa and Chicoutimi, Quebec and four printing plants in
Ontario and Quebec.
    Black added that Hollinger would also continue seeking
acquisitions of daily newspapers with circulation under 25,000
readers. He said Hollinger was currently talking to about 10
such newspapers in the U.S. where the company currently owns 23
dailies.
    "There is really no end to the ones that are available," he
told reporters, although he added that most remaining
acquisition opportunities are in the U.S.
    He said that Hollinger's 58 pct-owned Daily Telegraph PLC,
of London, should become profitable in this year's fourth
quarter.
   
    For full-year 1987, the Daily Telegraph could break even or
better, said Black, citing major reductions in labor costs and
improved technology at the Telegraph, Britain's largest
circulation quality daily. The Telegraph lost 13.2 mln Canadian
dlrs last year.
    Daily Telegraph chief executive Andrew Knight told
reporters after the meeting that the Telegraph's daily
circulation had risen by 25,000 since September to about
1,150,000 on weekdays, despite added competition from the new
Independent daily newspaper.
   
    Knight said The Independent was not affecting the
Telegraph's growth, but was making inroads into the circulation
of other London quality dailies such as The Times and The
Guardian.
    Hollinger chairman Black predicted Hollinger would post
1987 net income of about 55 mln dlrs, or one dlr a share,
including extraordinary gains from previous sales of
discontinued operations. Hollinger lost 87 mln dlrs or 6.54
dlrs a share last year on fewer average shares and after an
extraordinary loss of 52 mln dlrs.
   
    Black told shareholders that first quarter operating
earnings on continuing operations amounted to 499,000 dlrs
against a year-ago loss of 165,000 dlrs.
    Revenues on continuing operations rose to 102.1 mln dlrs
from 1.5 mln dlrs last year, which did not include Daily
Telegraph revenues, he added. Consolidated first quarter
figures were not disclosed.
    He said the Daily Telegraph's first quarter operating loss
was sharply reduced from last year.

<TITLE>REAGAN SEEKS ROMANIA TRADE CONCESSION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan called for continued
nondiscriminatory treatment for Romanian exports to the United
States in the face of congressional opposition because of the
Bucharest government's record on human rights.
    A White House statement said Reagan's decision to press for
continuation of so-called Most Favored Nation (MFN) status for
Romania had been "exceptionally difficult" and came after "all
options were seriously considered."
    But the statement said that despite concerns about human
rights abuses by the Bucharest government, the president had
decided that should be continued because it helped stimulate
emigration from Romania and gave the United States influence on
human rights practices there.
    The statement was issued as Reagan sent to Congress
requests for one-year extensions of MFN for Romania, Hungary
and China.
    The House of Representatives has attached to a trade bill
legislation that would temporarily deny MFN for Romania pending
certification by Reagan that the country had made progress on
human rights. There is no controversy over continuation of MFN
for Hungary and China.

<TITLE>LAST-MINUTE OPPOSITION TO GULF BILL ARISES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>House Speaker Jim Wright predicted
passage of legislation requiring the Reagan administration to
provide Congress with a report on its Mideast Gulf policy, but
a last-minute revolt by an alliance of liberals and
conservatives left the bill's fate in doubt.
    The legislation was written in the wake of the May 17th
Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf,
which killed 37 Americans, and President Reagan's decision to
protect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags
-- effectively making them American ships.
    Since the administration made known its reflagging plans,
congressional leaders complained they had not been consulted,
and some charged the policy could lead the United States into
the 6 1/2-year-old war between Iran and Iraq.
    The House was to vote today on a bill -- supported by the
Democratic and Republican congressional leadership and the
administration -- which demanded a report within seven days on
plans to meet the security needs of U.S. forces in the gulf.
    The resolution was expected to pass without controversy
today in the House Foreign Affairs Committee before the full
House was to take up the bill. But in a surprise move, liberal
Democrats and conservative Republicans on the committee joined
in an unusual alliance to oppose the resolution.
    Liberal Democrats said a lack of any restrictions in the
bill implied consent to Reagan's policies.

Assistance Act will be available to all eligible winter wheat
producers, producers of other types of wheat who were prevented
from planting their 1987 wheat crop because of a 1986 natural
disaster, and all producers who operate farms with program crop
acreage bases subject to flooding on 50 pct of such crop's
permitted acreage.
    A producer who did not enroll in the 1987 acreage reduction
program may become eligible by signing-up no later than July
15. Producers will be informed by the local offices when
applications are being accepted, it said.
    The department said producers of wheat other than winter
wheat may use the 0/92 option if they were preventedf from
planting their intended acreage with wheat for harvest in 1987
because of any natural disasters which occured in 1986 or if
the farm is located in a county approved by Farmers Home
Administration for emergency loans for such disasters that
occurred in 1986.

<TITLE>PHELPS DODGE &lt;PD> SEES STRONGER COPPER PRICES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Phelps Dodge Corp officials said good
fundamentals in copper markets should lead to improving prices
for the metal.
    In an interview with Reuters, chairman G. Robert Durham
said continued strong demand and low inventories pushed prices
up eight to nine pct on the New York Commodities Exchange last
month.
    "Our customers in this country are living off the tailgates
of our trucks," he said, referring to tightness of supply and
strong demand. "The fundamentals are good."
   
    Asked if metal prices will continue to rise, Durham said;
"All I know is, fundamentals cannot be ignored."
    He said copper supplies are lower than they have been for
almost 20 years. Last year, copper demand was second highest on
record behind 1984, he said.
    Phelps Dodge is the nation's largest copper company, with
annual production expected to reach 500,000 tons this year.
   
    During the interview, executive vice president Douglas
Yearley said he believed it was only a matter of time before
the copper price rose "because there aren't that many new
projects coming on, and demand, short of a major recession,
will continue to grow modestly."
    Copper for July delivery rose more than two cts a pound to
more than 69 cents in Comex trading today. A one cent a pound
rise in copper prices yields 10 mln dlrs in annual earnings for
Phelps Dodge, the company said.
    "Demand has been surprisingly good in 1987, in construction
and other areas," Yearley said.
   
    New production later this year from a Bingham, Utah, mine
owned by Kennecott Corp, a unit of British Petroleum Co PLC's
&lt;BP> Standard Oil Co, a mine in New Guinea and Phelps Dodge's
own expanded Morenci, Ariz., mine will be offset by production
shortfalls in Mexico and Zambia, he said.
    Durham said production costs at the New Mexico-located
Chino mine will be in line with conventional copper production
at the company's other mines by the fourth quarter. The
company's total production costs, including depreciation but
before interest and corporate expense, should be below 50 cts a
pound by late 1989 or 1990, he said.

total value of export credit guarantees authorized to Haiti for
the current fiscal year for all commodities to 12.0 mln dlrs,

    All sales must be registered and exports completed by Sept
30, 1987, it noted.

<TITLE>U.S. WHEAT IN SENEGAL MARKET -- USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>After a highly favorable reception of
a trial batch of bread baked from 300 lbs of U.S. wheat flour
last February, the Senegalese appear ready to take delivery of
a first tranche of 10,500 tonnes of mixed U.S. wheat, the U.S.
Agriculture Department said.
    In its report on U.S. Export Markets for U.S. Grain, the
department noted Senegal had bought 100,000 tonnes of wheat
under the Export Enhancement Program last November, but local
opposition from millers, accustomed to French wheat, has been
delaying deliveries.
    As a result there were a series of baking seminars as well
as the trial batch, in an effort to satisfy local flour millers
and convince key officials of the qualities of U.S. wheat.
    The department said if deliveries of U.S. wheat to Senegal
remain on track, the U.S. could dominate a wheat market that
had been expected to import 140,000 tonnes of mostly French
wheat during the 1987/88 (July-June) season.

<TITLE>INVESTMENT CRUCIAL TO U.S. TEXTILE RECOVERY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>With more private investment, not more
protection, the U.S. textile industry could become competitive
with the most modern foreign producers, analysts from two
congressional agencies said today.
    The Office of Technology Assessment, a nonpartisan arm of
Congress told a House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee hearing
there was still concern for the future of parts of the U.S.
textile and apparel industry, but there was more reason for
optimism than a few years ago.
    "While textile producers are making significant
investments, they could do more," OTA analyst Henry Kelly said.
    The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the nonpartisan
budget analysis arm of Congress, said federal loans or loan
guarantees would be preferable options for Congress rather than
increased trade protection which could lead to foreign
retaliation.
    CBO analyst Edward Gramlich said past trade protections,
first imposed in the 1950's have had only a small benefit for
profits and investments of domestic firms.
    Trade Subcommittee chairman, Rep. Sam Gibbons, said the
agencies analyses seemed to agree with his opinion against
congressional approval of protectionist textile quota
legislation aimed mainly at Western Europe, Japan and other
Asian textile producing countries.
    President Reagan last year vetoed a textile protection bill
but it was reintroduced in this session of Congress and is
expected to be voted on in the House this year.
    However, approval this year is in doubt because passage of
a major trade bill without specific protections for textiles
showed a weakening of support for the legislation.
    Most U.S. producers have fallen behind other foreign
producers in the use of modern textile and apparel production
equipment and net imports are growing faster than the domestic
markets, Kelly said.
    He added that private investment in the textile and
clothing industry in 1983 of 0.5 pct was less than one-seventh
the average manufacturing investment of 3.9 pct.
    Despite existing import quotas and tariffs, imports of
textiles grew 26 pct in 1986 and imports of apparel grew 14 pct
while U.S. production rose only 1.9 pct.
    "The traditional industry seems destined to be replaced by
new technology, imports, or some combination of both. While the
industry may not be able to compete in all domestic markets
that it enjoyed twenty years ago, the results of our research
indicate that portions of the domestic market can be recovered,
and that exports can be expanded," Kelly said.

the Manitoba Agriculture weekly crop report.
    The rains replenished formerly low soil moisture reserves,
with reserves in all areas now rated good, the report said.
    Plantings were virtually complete across the province and
germination was well advanced. However, some fields still
showed spotty stands.
    Cereal crops in the southwest were 90 pct germinated, with
some fields already in the subsequent tillering stage, it said.
Oilseeds in the northwest region were about 80 pct emerged in
many areas, with other regions 50 to 70 pct emerged.

<TITLE>PHELPS DODGE &lt;PD> SETS SIGHTS ON ACQUISITION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Steven Radwell, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Phelps Dodge Corp chairman G. Robert
Durham said the company is prepared to make another large
non-copper acquisition and that a deal could be struck in the
near future.
    In an interview with Reuters, Durham said the company was
examining potential candidates but not yet talking with any.
    He declined to name the companies but said a deal could
occur as soon as the second half of 1987.
   
    Phelps Dodge, which ranks as the largest copper producer in
the U.S., last year paid 240 mln dlrs for Columbian Chemicals
Co, a maker of carbon black which is used in rubber and tires
among other products.
    The purchase was part of a strategic plan to diversify and
eventually match earnings from non-copper operations and copper
operations.
    Phelps Dodge could spend between 250 mln and 500 mln dlrs
to buy another non-copper company, Durham said, citing about
100 mln dlrs of cash and 580 mln dlrs of untapped bank credit.
   
    Any acquisition candidate would have to have a different
economic cycle than copper, substantial earnings and good
management, he said. Phelps Dodge would only want a friendly
deal, he added.
    "We're not talking high-tech, or financial services or
about a perfume company," he said. "We want a good basic
industrial company that will fit into our management
structure," Durham said.
   
    During the interview, Durham and other executives also said
continued strong demand and tight copper supply should lead to
higher prices for the metal.
    "In my view, it's not a matter of if but when the price
(for copper) will improve because there aren't that many new
projects coming on, and demand, short of a major recession,
will continue to grow modestly," said executive vice president
Douglas Yearley. Phelps Dodge continues to lower its cost of
producing copper, the executives said. Costs should be below 50
cents a pound, after depreciation but before interest and
corporate expense, by 1989 or 1990.
    Production costs are about 56 to 57 cents a pound now
compared to one dlr a pound in 1981, some Wall St analysts
said.
    Durham said copper supplies are lower than they have been
for almost 20 years and demand continued to be strong.
    He declined to project results for the second quarter or
year. But he said the quarter was going well and the rise in
copper prices in the last month will help results.
    Durham said last month that the second quarter should match
the first quarter when earnings rose about 11 pct to 16.8 mln
dlrs or 49 cts a share.
    First quarter sales rose 61.5 pct to 372.9 mln dlrs,
reflecting the acquisition of Columbian Chemicals and increased
copper shipments from the Chino copper mine in New Mexico, also
acquired last year.
    Analysts are projecting 1987 earnings of 2.20 dlrs to 2.75
dlrs a share, up sharply from 1.79 dlrs in 1986.

<TITLE>AMOCO &lt;AN> SAYS DOME &lt;DMP> BUY GOOD FOR CANADA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    EDMONTON, Alberta, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Amoco Corp's wholly owned Amoco
Canada Petroleum Co Ltd said its proposed 5.22-billion-
Canadian-dlr acquisition of Dome Petroleum Ltd will benefit
Canada just like the foreign investment that made possible
commercial development of Alberta's oilsands.
    Amoco Canada president T. Don Stacy told an oilsands
conference that "Amoco Canada has presented the solution to the
Dome problem, and we're investing our confidence, dollars and
determination to make that solution work."
    The Amoco buyout of debt-burdened Dome has angered Canadian
nationalists, who want a Canadian buyer for Dome.
    Stacy described Amoco Canada's previously reported share
offer proposal as a chance to increase Canadian ownership of
the country's oil and gas industry, now at about 50 pct.
    He reiterated that Amoco planned virtually no layoffs of
Dome employees. He also reaffirmed that Amoco would reinvest in
Amoco Canada-Dome properties all available cash flow for five
years after the acquisition.

<TITLE>U.S. HOUSE PASSES GULF BILL DESPITE OPPOSITION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. House of Representatives 
approved a bill that requires the Reagan administration to
provide Congress with a report on its Gulf policy but does not
place any restrictions on its actions.
    The bill passed 305-102 -- winning a necessary two-thirds
of those voting -- despite a last-minute revolt by an alliance
of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans who sought to
defeat it as a signal that a growing number of legislators
oppose President Reagan's policies in the region.
    The legislation was passed in the wake of the May 17th
Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf,
which killed 37 Americans, and Reagan's decision to protect 11
Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags --
effectively making them American ships.
    The legislation -- supported by Congress' Democratic and
Republican leadership as well as by the administration --
required Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger to provide a
report to Congress, within seven days of enactment, on plans to
protect U.S. warships and flag ships in the Persian Gulf.
    It did not, however, place any restrictions on the
administration as it proceeds to reflag the Kuwaiti ships and
thus has no immediate effect on U.S. policy.
    The Senate was expected to approve the legislation this
week. The bill would then be sent to Reagan for signature.
    Supporters of the bill said passage of the bill was only a
first step toward a greater congressional involvement in
formulating policy.
    But Democratic critics said the bill did not ask the
administration to address tough policy questions in the report.

<TITLE>U.S. SENATE TEAM WANTS MULTINATIONAL GULF FORCE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KUWAIT, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The leaders of a U.S. Senate team probing
American defense strategy in the MidEast Gulf said they favored
a multinational force to keep oil flowing through the waterway.
    Sen. John Glenn and John Warner, in Kuwait as part of a
Gulf Arab tour, said at a news conference that top officials in
the area appeared ready to discuss extra facilities needed if
the U.S. upgraded its defense role.
    The Senate team next heads for the United Arab Emirates,
their last stop on a fact-finding mission prompted by Reagan
administration plans to let half of Kuwait's 22-tanker fleet
fly the U.S. flag.
    Glenn and Warner said the U.S., Britain and France, should
explore the possibility of a unified Gulf force.
    "The American ships, the British ships, the French ships now
talk to each other and all we've got to do is formalize this
arrangement," Warner said.
    Glenn said a multinational force could be effectively
deployed within 24 hours of a decision.
    Glenn voiced a preference for a United Nations
multinational force, or failing that, an American, British,
French force with cooperation from the Gulf Arab states.
    Warner voiced concern that the Soviet Union might use the
situation in the Gulf to raise its presence. "And,
unequivocally, all GCC states we have talked with, have said
that would not be in the interests of the Arabian peninsula."

<TITLE>COLOMBIAN GROUP SUSPENDS BOMBINGS OF PIPELINES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOGOTA, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>A Colombian group announced the suspension
of its bombings of oil pipelines pending the government's levy
of a social tax on foreign petroleum companies and an 800 mln
dlrs fine on the Occidental Petroleum Corp &lt;OXY>.
    There was no indication the government would meet the
conditions demanded by the leftist National Liberation Army
(ELN).
    According to the state oil firm, ECOPETROL, the ELN carried
out 72 attacks on petroleum pipelines between 1984 and 1986.
    The assaults, the most recent launched two months ago, have
caused an estimated total of 50 mln dlrs in damage.
    In a communique, the ELN said it would demand a tax of one
dollar per barrel of crude oil pumped by foreign firms as a
condition for maintaining its suspension of the assaults.
    Foreign oil firms pump an average of 225,083 barrels per
day in Colombia. Colombian tax authorities are investigating
Occidental, a U.S.-owned firm, for alleged tax evasion.
    If the charges are proven, the firm could face a fine of up
to 800 mln dlrs. The ELN demands the government charge the
penalty.

    The locals, part of United Steelworkers of America,
represent 2,600 production and maintenance workers. No date has

    The spokesman said talks were still ongoing with the two
other striking locals, representing 600 office and technical

since the strike started May 9.
    Each of the five locals has a separate contract that
expired April 30, but the main issues are similar.
    The Trail smelter produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and
110,000 long tons of lead last year, while the Sullivan mine at
Kimberley produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year, most for

<TITLE>EC WATCHING GULF WAR DEVELOPMENTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUXEMBOURG, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community (EC) should
watch very carefully for any developments in the Gulf War and
their consequences on the oil market, EC Energy Commissioner
Nicolas Mosar said today.
    Speaking two weeks after a U.S. warship was attacked in the
Gulf, Mosar warned, "An escalation in the Gulf would increase
tensions in the oil market."
    "But I do not want to be alarmist," he told a news conference
after an EC energy ministers meeting in Luxembourg.
    He said the volume of EC oil imports from the Gulf had
declined to around 31 pct of total oil imports in the first
three months of 1987 against 35 pct in the same period last
year. "There are also other potential sources of supplies in the
world," he added.
    The issue of Gulf oil imports was not discussed at the
ministers' meeting, he added.
    A EC committee of national experts in the so-called oil
supply group would discuss Gulf oil supplies at their bi-annual
meeting on June 19, he said.
    But any major decisions would have to be reserved for EC
foreign ministers, diplomats said.
    West European nations have so far shown little enthusiasm
for backing a U.S. plan to give military protection to merchant
ships in the Gulf which could help insure the safety of oil
supplies.

of an estimated 3.24 mln is expected five pct up on 1986. The
south and south central areas of Alberta lacked moisture with
germination patchy at best. Growth prospects in northern areas
are generally in the good to very good range.
   Soil moisture is better in the north central and Peace
areas, the wheat pool said.

<TITLE>N.Z. APRIL CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT NARROWS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, June 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>New Zealand's current account deficit
narrowed to 76 mln N.Z. Dlrs in April from a revised 89 mln
dlrs in March, and 224 mln dlrs in April 1986, in a smoothed
seasonally-adjusted measurement, the Statistics Department
said.
    The March figure was revised from 69 mln dlrs.
    The department said in a statement seasonally adjusted, but
non-smoothed figures, showed a deficit of 99 mln dlrs against
76 mln dlrs in March and 230 mln dlrs in April 1986.
    Totally unadjusted figures show a deficit of 83 mln dlrs
against 164 mln dlrs in March, revised from 178 mln dlrs, and
compared with 262 mln in April 1986.
    The smoothed seasonally adjusted series shows a surplus on
merchandise trade of 145 mln dlrs against 135 mln dlrs in March
and 30 mln dlrs in April 1986.
    Seasonally adjusted but non-smoothed figures show a
merchandise trade surplus of 132 mln dlrs against a 148 mln dlr
surplus in March and a 14 mln dlr surplus in April 1986.
    Unadjusted merchandise figures show a surplus of 151 mln
dlrs against a 5.0 mln dlr (revised from 10 mln dlr) deficit in
March and a 31 mln dlr deficit in March 1986.
    The smoothed seasonally adjusted deficit on invisibles was
234 mln N.Z. Dlrs against 236 mln dlrs in March and 255 in
April 1986.
    The seasonally adjusted but non-smoothed deficit on
invisibles was 240 mln dlrs against 229 mln dlrs in March and
245 mln dlrs in April 1986. The unadjusted deficit on
invisibles was 234 mln dlrs against 158 mln dlrs, revised from
168 mln dlrs, in March and 231 mln dlrs in April 1986.
    Seasonally adjusted export and import figures were not
available.
    The department said these figures show a continuing
improvement in the current account deficit, caused mainly by an
improvement in the balance on merchandise trade which has now
being in surplus since november 1985.

<TITLE>STRONG DEMAND FOR PERU BISMUTH IN JAN/MAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Very strong demand from all markets
including, recently, Japan has resulted in Peru's bismuth
exports showing an impressive increase in January/May 1987,
Peru's state owned mining industry's marketing arm Minpeco S.A.
Said.
    In a statement released by its London office, Minpeco said
Peruvian customs figures for bismuth exports for the first five
months were 574.8 tonnes compared with 160.7 tonnes in the same
period of 1986 and 483.4 tonnes during the whole of 1986,
Minpeco said.
    A breakdown of the figures showed Peru exported 296.4
tonnes of bismuth to the U.S. During Jan/May 1987 compared with
127.0 during the whole of 1986. Other recipients were Peoples
Republic of China 110.4 (100.0), Holland 100.2 (150.0), USSR
50.0 (50.0) and other areas 17.8 tonnes (56.4).
    Sales to the U.K., West Germany, France and other Western
and Eastern European countries are hidden under the heading
Holland as Minpeco sells to customers in these countries from
stocks the company normally holds in Rotterdam, the statement
said.

<TITLE>U.S. MEAT INDUSTRY LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN IN JAPAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. meat industry has launched an
aggressive promotion campaign in Japan to increase consumer
awareness of U.S. beef and persuade the Japanese government to
relax current beef import quotas.
    U.S. beef sales to Japan, currently around 480 mln dlrs
annually, could increase to over two billion dlrs and as high
as six billion dlrs by the year 2000 if Japanese quotas were
removed and the Japanese consumer were made more aware of the
attributes of U.S. beef, officials of the U.S. Meat Export
Federation said at a press conference today.
    Partially funded with a 6.5 mln dlr award made through the
Agriculture Department's Targeted Export Assistance (TEA)
program, a five-year meat promotion campaign in Japan was
launched by the U.S. Meat Export Federation in April.
    "The promising Japanese beef market could be one of the
bright spots for U.S. agricultural exports," said Philip Seng,
Asian Director for the Federation. "We supply and they (Japan)
buy a very high quality of beef. They like our beef and want to
buy more," he said.
    Seng pointed to Japan's beef quota system, which limits
total Japanese beef imports to 177,000 tonnes per year and U.S.
imports to 58,400 tonnes, as the major constraint in expanding
U.S. beef shipments to Japan.
    The quotas were implemented in 1977 at a time of heavy
Japanese foreign beef imports. The current quota agreement
expires next March and beef quota negotiations are set to get
underway this fall.
    The Reagan administration has called for an end to the
quotas by April, 1988, but Japanese officials have said they
would not liberalize imports regardless of the U.S. pressure.
    Officials from the Meat Export Federation told Reuters that
they do not expect a complete lifting of the quota, but that
they hope for at least a gradual increase in the quota.
    High beef prices in Japan caused by the protected market
has also kept beef consumption at modest levels, meat industry
officials said.
    Japanese shoppers pay an average of 27.14 dlrs for a U.S.
tenderloin steak in a restaurant and an average of 47.42 dlrs
for a Japanese-produced restaurant steak, the meat association
said. At the retail level, U.S. striploin sells for 9.77 dlrs
per pound, while Japanese beef sells for 28.51 dlrs per lb.
    Japanese consumers currently eat less than 10 lbs of beef
per year, compared to 78 lbs for the average American,
officials said.
    Total beef consumption in Japan is now 700,000 to 800,000
tonnes per year, but Seng said with the removal of quotas and a
decrease in beef prices, consumption could increase to 3.2 mln
tonnes.

<TITLE>U.S. HOUSE PASSES MIDEAST GULF BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The House today approved a bill
requiring the Reagan administration to report to Congress on
its Mideast Gulf policy but not restricting its actions.
    The vote in favor was despite a last-minute revolt by an
alliance of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans who
sought to defeat it as a signal that a growing number of
legislators oppose President Reagan's policies in the region.
    In the Senate, a leading Republican senator, former Senate
Appropriations Committee Chairman Mark Hatfield of Oregon, said
he would try to prevent consideration of the bill.
    He said he will put a so-called "hold" on the bill until he
finds out whether the War Powers Act applies to protecting
Kuwaiti tankers.
    Congressional leaders complain they were not consulted
about plans to put the U.S. flag on Kuwaiti ships and some
charged the policy could lead the U.S. into the Iran-Iraq war.
    Conservative Republicans said increasing the U.S. military
obligation in the gulf would place impossible burdens on
American servicemen and equipment, and warned it could lead to
war.
    "It is a real snake pit at best and a powder keg that will
blow sky-high at worst," said Wisconsin Rep. Toby Roth.

<TITLE>VOLCKER LEAVES VOID ON LDC DEBT, BANKERS SAY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    BY ALAN WHEATLEY, REUTERS</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Paul Volcker's resignation as Federal
Reserve Board chairman creates a serious leadership vacuum at a
time of deep uncertainty about the future management of the
third-world debt crisis, bankers said.
    They said Volcker did more than any other official to hold
the financial system together when Mexico halted interest
payments in August 1982 and has played a central role ever
since.
    "Where is the leadership going to come from? Suddenly
there's a terrible void," one New York banker said.
    Volcker's expertise will be all the more sorely missed
because International Monetary Fund managing director Michel
Camdessus is new to his job and Barber Conable is finding it
hard to make a mark as World Bank president, bankers said.
    Moreover, Volcker's successor, Alan Greenspan, has little
experience of international affairs and third world debt.
    "Greenspan does not have the sensitivity to these issues
and the sense of understanding of their complexity that Volcker
has. Volcker understands what motivates people outside the U.S.
That was in his gut. Greenspan just does not have the intuitive
feeling," one banker said.
    This banker, who has discussed debt questions with
Greenspan, described his views as simplistic.
    But Robert Hormats of Goldman, Sachs and Co said he was not
worried by Greenspan's lack of international experience.
    "People rush to judgment, but once they get to know
Greenspan I'm sure they'll find him an excellent replacement,"
said Hormats, a former Administration official.
    Anyone nominated to replace Volcker would have paled in the
initial comparison, Hormats said. "Volcker had the status of a
financial demigod and you can't attain that status overnight,"
he said.
    One veteran debt rescheduler said Volcker, together with
the Bank of England, deserves credit for keeping the banking
system intact after Mexico's default.
    "If it hadn't been for him, the world would look a lot
different now," he said. "Whether you agreed with him or not,
he has a superb grasp of ideas."
    Certainly, not all bankers did agree all the time with
Volcker. In particular, he was roundly criticized by some for
more or less forcing them last September to grant Mexico
generous terms on its 77 billion dlr new-loan and debt
rescheduling agreement.
    "Volcker lost a lot of credibility by overstepping the
bounds and pushing the package onto the banks," commented one
banker who helped to negotiate the Mexican deal.
    Another critic was Citicorp chairman John Reed, who said
the 13/16 pct interest margin would deter some bank lenders and
thus delay Mexico's return to the voluntary markets.
    It was a review of the fate of the Mexican deal - and of
others that followed it for Chile, Venezuela, the Philippines
and Argentina - that helped to convince Reed that the debt
crisis was not about to be solved and that Citicorp needed to
bolster its reserves in case some of the loans went bad.
    "It certainly contributed to the general feeling of
malaise," one Citicorp banker said in describing the impact of
the Mexican package on the bank's decision to add three billion
dlrs to its reserve for possible loan losses.
    That decision, since followed by Chase Manhattan and
Security Pacific Corp, may profoundly alter the strategy of
creditors and debtors alike for tackling the debt crisis.
    But no one is sure what the impact will be. "It's very
difficult for anyone to know which way the debt problem is
going, and with Volcker out of the picture it just adds to the
uncertainty," one banker said.

<TITLE>NEAR TERM STRENGTH SEEN FOR CURRENCY FUTURES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    by Patricia Campbell, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Currency futures are likely to move
higher following the sharp rally today after President Reagan
announced that Paul Volcker would not accept a third term as
Federal Reserve Chairman and that Alan Greenspan was nominated
as his replacement, currency analysts said.
    Contrary to predictions before the Volcker resignation,
analysts are calling for higher currency futures prices between
now and the June 8 Venice economic summit.
    In particular, uncertainty about Greenspan's attitude to
the dollar could undermine sentiment toward the U.S. currency,
analysts said.
    Greenspan said today that the dollar appeared to be nearing
a bottom, but the market will bear in mind his remarks in
Chicago last week that the dollar's recent move upward was a
technical reaction and that it would trade significantly lower,
analysts said.
   
    "Disappointment of European central bankers over the
appointment will be used as an opportunity to sell the dollar
lower," said Manufacturers Hanover Futures vice president Carol
Mackoff.
    "The international community will not like this
appointment," as it suggests the possibility that the U.S.
budget deficit is too much of a burden on monetary policy and
that Volcker was unable to get the commitment he sought to
reduce the deficit, added Merrill Lynch Economics analyst David
Horner.
     Furthermore, "that Greenspan was not named two months ago
suggests that he was not the Administration's first choice --
and that the status of his appointment was as a bridesmaid,"
Horner said.
    A declining dollar scenario with higher currency futures
prior to and throughout the Venice meetings would be mitigated
only by concrete action as opposed to "jawboning" at the G-7
summit, he said.
    But G-7 finance ministers, judged by recent statements, may
be at an impasse, analysts said.
    Japan and West Germany today reiterated that neither
planned further interest rate cuts, despite pressure from the
U.S. to do so, Mackoff said.
    The U.S., on the other hand, has not cut its budget deficit
as Japan and West Germany have urged, she said.
    Should G-7 members force a U.S. commitment to cut its
budget deficit in the next two years, a further decline in the
dollar could be forestalled, Horner said.
    However, "the impact from Venice will be nothing if nothing
changes," Horner said.
    Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. analyst Craig Sloane
said European currencies will likely move to the higher end of
their 1987 ranges after today's sharp advance.
    For the next two weeks, Sloan calls for September yen
futures to advance toward the 0.007200 area. He said September
marks could close in on 0.5700 as an upside target, while Swiss
francs could climb to a range between 0.6900 and 0.6950.

<TITLE>WORLD BANK SUSPENDS LOANS TO PERU - CENTRAL BANK</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Walker Simon, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>     LIMA, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The World Bank has suspended loans to Peru
because the country has over two months of payment arrears with
the lending agency, central bank general manager Hector Neyra
said.
     He told reporters the government decided to stop paying
the World Bank because scheduled repayments outweighed the
loans it was due to receive.
     The measure was the latest hard-line debt stance adopted
by the government of President Alan Garcia, one of Latin
America's most delinquent debtors. The 22-month-old
administration has cut repayments to 10 pct of export earnings
on nearly all its 14.4 billion dlr foreign debt.
     Neyra said since late 1986 Peru had sought an accomodation
with the World Bank under which it would receive more credits
than it would remit in repayments.
     Neyra stressed Peru was not withdrawing from the world
bank. The country had recently increased its capital
suscription in the institution by about three mln dollars.
    The Bank would immediately resume loan disbursements to
Peru once it cleared its arrears, he said. He did not specify
the value of the overdue payments. The economy ministry said
Peru's debt to the world bank was 521 mln dlrs at end-1985.
    At the end of last year, Peru's total foreign debt stood at
14.46 billion dollars, 13.17 billion dollars of which is
medium- and-long-term debt, the central bank said. Total
arrears were 5.42 billion dollars.
    Central bank president Leonel Figueroa said Peru had enough
hard currency, gold and silver on hand to cover 10 or 11
months' worth of imports.
    The holdings of the two precious metals and the hard
currencies were valued at 2.172 billion dlrs on May 22, 1987,
he said.
    Gross reserves were slightly lower at 1.857 billion dlrs
because this classification did not include silver holdings and
undervalued the central bank's gold.
    Reserves were projected to fall at most 150 mln dlrs this
year, he said.

<DATELINE>    SEOUL, June 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Korea's wholesale price index, base
1980, rose 0.4 pct to 127.0 in May after a 1.1 pct rise in
April and was 1.5 pct higher than in May 1986, the Bank of
Korea said.
    The May consumer price index, which has the same base, rose
1.4 pct to 149.1 after a 0.3 pct gain in April, for a
year-on-year rise of 3.5 pct.
    Wholesale prices rose 2.0 pct in the first five months of
1986, while consumer prices rose by 3.2 pct. Bank officials
said the rises were due to a strong yen which made imports of
Japanese parts, raw and intermediary materials more expensive.

<TITLE>BRAZIL'S ECONOMIC PLAN MAY PERMIT NEW DEBT TALKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRASILIA, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil's new economic plan should enable
Brazil to renew negotiations with creditors on its 111-billion
dlr foreign debt within the next 30 days, Finance Minister Luiz
Carlos Bresser Pereira said.
    The plan, which predicted the economy would grow 4.5 pct
this year and inflation would drop to 10 pct a month by
December from 20 pct at present, would be officially announced
"within three or four weeks," he told a news conference.
    The minister said he presented an outline of the program
during a cabinet meeting in which President Jose Sarney
declared "a total war" on inflation.
    Sarney told the meeting an austerity plan to trim
government spending would be introduced.
    Bresser Pereira said Brazil faced the risk of economic
recession, but he estimated the gross national product would
grow 4.5 pct this year. It grew 8.3 pct last year.
    Its April inflation rate was a record 20.96 pct and
contributed to an accumulated rate of 84.19 pct in the first
four months of 1987.
    Bresser Pereira said the economic plan would seek to keep
the economy growing, to build an eight billion dlr trade
surplus and to force a sharp drop in the inflation rate.

    Nakasone told reporters he did not expect U.S. Policy to
change after Volcker steps down.

    The new rate, if unmatched by other banks, will be the

    Australian prime rates have now retreated from a recent
peak of 19 pct in October in line with declining money market

<DATELINE>    PEKING, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>China is moving to stabilise world prices
of tungsten after fluctuating prices this year affected the
country's export earnings, the China Daily said.
    The paper quoted industry officials as saying they would
fix export prices on the basis of the world market, stop
smuggling and encourage producers to reduce exports.
    Current world prices range from 49 to 55 dlrs per tonne
unit, but China suffered heavy losses when the price slumped to
39 dlrs earlier this year, it said.
    Some 45 pct of world tungsten exports come from China, but
the country imports high-grade tungsten products.

<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Australia's &lt;Ansett Airlines> will
exercise an option to acquire 20 pct of America West Airlines
Inc &lt;AWAL.O> for about 31.5 mln U.S. Dlrs, &lt;Ansett Transport
Industries Ltd> managing director Peter Abeles said.
    Exercise, involving the purchase of about three mln new
America West shares for 10.50 U.S. Dlrs each, was scheduled to
be finalised in July or August, he said in a statement.
    Abeles said Ansett would become the largest single
shareholder in what he said was the fastest growing airline in
the United States. America West is based in Phoenix, Arizona.
    Under the terms of the option agreement, Ansett would have
the right to maintain its 20 pct position in the event of
future stock sales, but could not go beyond 20 pct unless so
requested by America West, Abeles said.
    America West would retain the right of first refusal if
Ansett offered any of the shares for sale.
    In addition, Ansett would gain one board seat, he said.
    Ansett Transport Industries wholly owns Ansett Airlines,
one of Australia's two major domestic airlines, and is in turn
owned 50/50 by Abeles' international transport group TNT Ltd
&lt;TNTA.S> and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd &lt;NCPA.S>.

against four ships of 104,500 gt a year earlier, the Japan Ship

<TITLE>SHULTZ PREDICTS RAPID NARROWING OF U.S. TRADE GAP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SINGAPORE, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Secretary of State George Shultz said
the U.S. Would erase its large foreign trade deficit faster
than many predicted, and the consequences for its trade
partners might be traumatic.
    "The U.S. Economy will inevitably make the adjustment
necessary to move from a deficit to a surplus trade balance in
order to service our growing foreign debt," he told a conference
attended by the six members of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations and their leading Western friends.
    "In my view, this will happen more rapidly than many
observers now predict."
    "The universal strategy of aggressive export-led growth is
becoming less effective," Shultz said.
    "It is not arithmetically possible for every country in the
world to be a net exporter at the same time. The U.S. Deficit,
which we all decry, has been in a sense the place into which
everyone's export-led strategy for growth has gone."
    "The huge surpluses of Japan and (West) Germany have fed on
this deficit, so something will have to give and it will be
possibly a traumatic experience," he added.
    "While you must keep up the pressure on us to eschew
protectionist policies, you must act too," Shultz said.
    "I can do a better job of convincing the Congress to leave
our door open to imports if more of our trading partners open
their doors wider," he told the group, which included
representatives from Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand and
the European Community.

<TITLE>DAIRY FARM BIDS 146.6 MLN STG FOR 22 PCT KWIK SAVE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Dairy Farm International Holdings
Ltd> said in a statement it is making a tender offer for 22 pct
of Kwik Save Discount Group Plc &lt;KWIK.L> of Britain for a total
146.6 mln stg.
    Dairy Farm said it will offer to buy up to 32.58 mln Kwik
Save shares at 4.50 stg each.
    The offer will bring Dairy Farm's stake in Kwik Save to 25
pct from the present 3.5 pct, or 5.25 mln shares.
    The offer, which will begin on Monday and ends June 30,
requires that the shares tendered will bring its stake to at
least 15 pct.
    Dairy Farm said it will finance the acquisition by placing
89 mln shares with affiliate Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd
&lt;JARS.HK> at 5.10 H.K. Dlrs each for a total of 454 mln dlrs.
    The placement will raise Jardine Strategic's stake in Dairy
Farm to 39.75 pct from the current 35.3 pct.
    It said the Kwik Save purchase will also be financed with a
loan from the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp &lt;HKBH.HK>. It
did not give the size of the loan but it said it would raise
its net bank borrowings to a maximum of 2.2 billion H.K. Dlrs.
    Dairy Farm said it would reduce its bank borrowings by the
proceeds from the previously announced sale of its office
building in Sydney for 625 mln dlrs.
    It will consider raising additional capital, most probably
through a placement of convertible preference shares in the
Euromarket, it added.
    Company chairman Simon Keswick said the U.K. Market "offers
attractive opportunities for competitively priced food
retailers" and that "a strategic investment in Kwik Save offers
the best vehicle to pursue those opportunities."

<TITLE>JAPAN 1986/87 COMPOUND FEED OUTPUT UP 2.3 PCT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese compound feed output rose 2.3 pct
to 25.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87 ended March 31 from 25.23 mln a
year earlier, the Agriculture Ministry said.
    The marginal rise reflected slight growth in demand for
poultry raising and a moderate increase in demand for beef
cattle raising, Ministry officials said.
    Compound feed sales totalled 26.01 mln tonnes in 1986/87
against 25.40 mln a year ago, while end-March stocks were
217,554 tonnes against 224,101.
    Corn use in feed output in 1986/87 rose to 11.71 mln tonnes
from 11.02 mln a year earlier due to low import prices.
    The officials said corn imports rose because the world
surplus and the yen's strength against the dollar reduced
Chicago prices. The corn compounding ratio rose to 45.2 pct in
1986/87 from 43.4 pct a year earlier.
    Sorghum use rose marginally to 4.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87
from 4.79 mln, but the compounding ratio fell to 18.5 pct from
18.9 pct because of greater corn use. Higher import prices due
to poor harvests last year in major producing nations such as
Argentina made feed makers reluctant to use sorghum.
    Soybean meal use fell to 2.58 mln tonnes from 2.63 mln and
the compounding ratio declined to 10.0 pct from 10.3 pct.
    The drop in soybean meal consumption resulted from
increased use of cheaper rapeseed meal, the officials said.
    Rapeseed consumption in 1986/87 was 563,889 tonnes against
528,152 a year earlier. The compounding ratio rose to 2.2 pct
from 2.1 pct.

<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Commonwealth Bank of Australia said
it will lower its reference rate for loans to 15.75 pct from
16.25 pct and its overdraft reference rate to 16.25 pct from
16.75, effective June 24.
    Bank officials have said the bank regards the overdraft
reference rate, based on short-term rate trends, as its key
prime lending rate to corporate customers. The loan reference
rate is based on longer term trends.
    The bank is the latest to cut prime rates in recent days
following a continuing decline in market rates. Other prime
rates now range from 16 pct to 17.5 pct.

support in principle to the production of platinum and silver
bullion coins at the Perth Mint, Treasurer Paul Keating said.
    This followed the success of the Australian Nugget gold
bullion coins launched this year, he said in a statement.
    He said that, as with the Australian nuggets, the coins
would be legal tender. The platinum coins would be made in four
weights but the silver coin would be of one ounce weight.
    He said detailed arrangements for their issue would be
finalised after talks between the Federal authorities and the
Western Australian government, owner of the Perth Mint.

<TITLE>S.KOREA SEES GNP GROWTH MORE THAN 10 PCT THIS YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SEOUL, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Korea's gross national product (GNP)
will exceed 10 pct real growth this year and the won will rise
further as long as the current account surplus continues to
widen, Deputy Prime Minister Chun In-Yong told reporters.
    Chung, who is also Minister of Economic Planning, said his
GNP estimate was based on the assumption that the economy will
remain stable.
    The official target for 1987 GNP growth is eight pct.
    GNP rose 15.6 pct between the first quarters of 1987 and
1986, according to provisional Bank of Korea figures.
    GNP rose 12.5 pct in calendar 1986.
    In the first four months of this year, the current account
swung to a surplus of 2.5 billion dlrs from a deficit of 294
mln dlrs in the same 1986 period.
    "What the Minister said does not imply any major economic
policy change," a Ministry spokesman told Reuters. "But he tried
to urge business circles to prepare for the forseeable economic
(future) ... A high won era."
    South Korean manufacturers, who have insisted the won
should not rise more than seven pct this year, have said they
plan to ask the government to slow down its appreciation
against the dollar.
    The Bank of Korea today quoted the won unchanged at 812.05
against the dollar, a 6.02 pct gain so far this year compared
with a 3.34 pct increase for the whole of 1986.
    The won strengthened by 6.60 won to the dollar in three
days earlier this month while an International Monetary Fund
team held talks here to discuss revaluation.

<DATELINE>    CANBERRA, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Australian crude oil and condensate
output fell 7.6 pct to 23,480 megalitres, or about 147 mln
barrels, in the first nine months of fiscal 1986/87 ending June
30, the Department of Resources and Energy said.
    The decline in production in the nine months to end-March
reflected mainly a sharp dip early in the fiscal year, when low
oil prices and high marginal excise rates led to a reduction of
output from Bass Strait, department figures in its Major Energy
Statistics publication show.
    A megalitre is 6,290 barrels.

<TITLE>NEW ZEALAND TO REPAY UP TO 600 MLN DLRS OF DEBT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>New Zealand will repay a portion of
its 42.48 billion N.Z. Dlr public debt for the first time since
1952 as a result of a 379 mln N.Z. Dlr budget surplus for
fiscal March 1988, Finance Minister Roger Douglas said.
    Douglas said in a budget statement the surplus is the first
achieved in New Zealand in 35 years. It compared with a 1.95
billion dlr deficit in fiscal 1987.
    Douglas said this year's government bond tender program
would be adjusted in the light of the surplus, providing for
the repayment of up to 600 mln dlrs of New Zealand's 21.74
billion dlrs of overseas debt.
    Details of which loans will be repaid have still to be
decided.
    Douglas said the present scale of the public debt was
massive.
    "It will take many years to reduce the debt to an acceptable
level," he said.

<TITLE>GOVERNMENT TO SELL 25 PCT OF AIR NEW ZEALAND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The New Zealand Government will sell
25 pct of state-owned &lt;Air New Zealand Ltd> to the public,
Civil Aviation minister Richard Prebble said.
    Prebble said in a statement the government would appoint an
adviser to help it decide how the shares should be sold, the
timing of any sales and the price.
    "Clearly there will be a need to gauge the effect of other
proposed share issues so as to enter the market at the best
opportunity," Prebble said.
    "We are in no particular rush to sell our shares in Air New
Zealand," he said.
    "Our aim is to maximise the benefit to the taxpayer. If that
means waiting for a while, then so be it," Prebble said.
    He said Air New Zealand expects to release its results soon
for the year to March 31 1987. He said he was confident it
would post an excellent profit.
    Prebble said Air New Zealand was successful but its ability
to prosper in future was hampered by its
wholly-government-owned status.
    Prebble said access to new sources of capital would
increase its ability to expand and develop.
    This sale announcement follows the public float in March of
around 13 pct of the &lt;Bank of New Zealand Ltd>.
    The government has said it will also float part of the
capital of other state-owned operations, including &lt;DFC New
Zealand Ltd>, formerly Development Finance Corp of New Zealand
Ltd, and Petroleum Corp of New Zealand Ltd.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T> and Sharp Corp
&lt;SHRP.T> decided to maintain exports of lap-top personal
computers to the European Community (EC) at last year's levels,
despite the halt of shipments to the U.S., Company spokesmen
told Reuters.
    They said the voluntary restraints were aimed at averting
EC sanctions urged by European computer makers. The Europeans
feared Japanese personal computers would flood EC markets after
Washington imposed 100 pct tariffs last April.
    Toshiba and Sharp together control about 40 pct of the
personal computer market in the EC, the Sharp spokesman said.
    Toshiba said exports of T1100 and T3100 lap-top computers
would continue at 5,000 units a month for the time being.
    Sharp said exports to the EC of PC 7000 series lap-top
personal computers would continue at last year's level of
12,000 to 16,000 units a year.
    Washington imposed the tariffs because of Japan's alleged
failure to uphold a 1986 agreement on semiconductor trade.

<TITLE>BELGIUM CUTS TREASURY CERTIFICATE RATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Belgian National Bank said it cut
one, two, and three month treasury certificate rates, all by
0.10 points, effective immediately.
    The cuts take the one month rate to 6.75 pct, the two month
rate to 6.80 pct and the key three month rate to 6.85 pct, the
central bank said in a telex.
    A National Bank spokesman said the modest cut was made
after a decline in domestic money market rates yesterday, and
was not expected to be followed by a cut in the 7.60 pct
discount rate.
    The short-term treasury certificate rates, and especially
the three-month rate, have been the National Bank's main
monetary policy instrument for the last two years.
    The discount rate has been the market's penalty rate rather
than a guiding rate since 1985, and its advances are currently
little used as liquidity is ample, bank economists said.
    The bank last cut one- to three-month certificate rates on
June 5, also by 0.10 points.

nominations to lift a higher proportion of Arab Heavy crude oil
under term contracts in July, oil industry sources said.
    Japanese companies requested a ratio of 80 pct Arab Heavy

Aramco for 100,000 barrels per day, the sources said. The
contractual ratio is 30 pct heavy crude to 70 pct light.
    Japanese demand for heavy crude oil has increased
substantially since the All Japan Seaman's Union ceased sailing
into the northern Mideast gulf last month, causing problems
with liftings of heavy Kuwait and Khafji crudes.

has informed its affiliated Japanese companies that crude oil
supplies will be 40 pct less than contractual volumes in July,
a spokesman for an affiliated company said.
    He said the allocations were in line with Indonesia's
production ceiling under its current OPEC quota, so they might
be increased if OPEC ratifies a production rise next week.
    Allocations of Indonesia's main traded crude, Minas, had
been cut by 50 pct and Duri by 38 pct, he said.
    Last month contractual volumes were cut by 30 pct.
    Contractual volumes assume no production ceiling.
    Oil traders said Indonesian grades were already trading
above their official selling prices (osp) on the spot market
due to strong demand from Japan and the U.S. And tight
supplies.
    A cargo of Duri loading in July was reportedly traded
yesterday at 70 cents over its osp of 15.60 dlrs per barrel and
Minas is trading about 20 cents higher, they said.

<TITLE>FRENCH OFFICIAL RESERVES RISE IN MAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>French official reserves rose 258 mln
francs in May to 420.50 billion francs from 420.24 billion at
the end of April, the Finance Ministry said.
    The slight rise partly reflected the repayment last month
of France's outstanding 11.95 billion francs of debt owed to
the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (FECOM).
    It also reflected a negative 314 mln franc position with
France's Exchange Stabilisation Fund after intervention
purchases of 10.6 billion francs during May.
    Foreign currency holdings fell 7.28 billion francs to
124.58 billion while ECU holdings fell by 5.55 billion francs
to 58.52 billion due to the repayment of part of France's debt
owed to the FECOM and Stabilisation Fund operations, the
ministry said.
    Claims on the IMF rose 1.14 billion francs to 18.97
billion, including a 385 mln franc increase in France's reserve
position with the IMF and a 751 mln franc rise in holdings of
Special Drawing Rights.
    Gold holdings were unchanged at 218.46 billion francs.

<TITLE>FRENCH STATE SELL-OFFS RAISE 52 BILLION FRANCS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, June 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The French government's privatisation
program, which began late last year, has earned the French
State about 52 billion francs to date, the Finance Ministry
said.
    Sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the
revenues raised from the privatisation program would be used in
priority to pay off public debt, which stood at 398.2 billion
at the end of 1986.
    The Ministry said in a communique that the returns included
banking group Societe Generale &lt;SGEN.PA>, which began its
two-week public flotation last Monday.
    The government has carried out eight flotations, as well as
the private sale of telephone group &lt;Cie Generale de
Constructions Telephoniques> (CGCT) since its denationalisation
scheme began last December with the sell-off of glass makers
Saint-Gobain &lt;SGEP.PA>, it added.
    The government has pledged to privatise 66 state-owned
industrial, banking and insurance companies by 1991.
    Other companies to be sold to the private sector in the
near future are television network TF-1 later this month and
banking group Cie Financiere de Suez &lt;FSPP.PA> in the autumn.
    The ministry said TF-1's forthcoming sell-off meant that a
third of the government's programme would have been completed
in less than nine months.
    Balladur on Sunday rejected press and opposition charges
that the share prices for privatised companies had been pitched
too low.
    He said that the average premium of shares trading on the
Bourse was between 15 and 30 pct over their offer price. This
compared with premiums of between 60 and 80 pct on similar
share flotations in Britain.

<TITLE>FIJI MAKES SUGAR PAYMENT TO GET HARVEST STARTED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SUVA, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Fiji sugar farmers will receive an interim
payment on the 1986 crop, four months ahead of schedule, in a
move aimed at getting harvesting of the drought-hit 1987 crop
under way, Governor-general Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau said.
    Industry sources said latest forecasts for the 1987 crop
indicated output of 360,000 tonnes, well down on the record
501,800 tonne tel quel production in the 1986 (May-December)
crop year.
    The previous record was set in 1982 when Fiji produced
486,790 tonnes.
    For the past month Fiji sugar farmers have delayed
harvesting the 1987 crop pending a response from the
Governor-general to demands following the May 14 coup.
    Ganilau said in a statement the Fiji Sugar Corp would make
a payment of five dlrs per tonne against the final payment for
the 1986 crop on the understanding that preparations by growers
for commencement of harvesting would be completed at all mills
by June 23.
    Crushing would commence at Labasa and Penang mills on June
23 and at Lautoka and Rarawai mills on June 30, he said.
    The interim payment, to be made on or about June 30, is the
full amount of the grower's share of 1986 sugar proceeds
received to-date. The balance will be paid in October.
    Growers had also called for the full 1987 forecast price of
23.50 dlrs per tonne of cane to be paid in cash on delivery to
the mill, but this has been rejected by the state controlled
Fiji Sugar Corp, Ganilau said.
    However, in addition to the scheduled delivery payment of
14.10 dlrs, an additional sum of 2.35 dlrs, or 10 pct of the
forecast price, would be paid on December 15, on all cane
harvested by November 30, he said.
    Ganilau said, "This will be at least one month in advance of
the expected date of payment of the second payment of cane. The
balance of the second payment will be made six weeks after the
end of crushing."
    Another demand of Fiji's 22,000 small farmers was that an
estimated 14 mln dlr loan from the Fiji Development Bank (FDB)
for the 1983 cane crop rehabilitation programme be written off.
The FDB rejected this request.
    Ganilau said, however, "The bank is prepared to carefully
consider requests for rescheduling loan repayments in cases of
hardship on a case-by-case basis."
    In response to a further demand that all soldiers be
removed from the cane growing areas, Ganilau said the army
would restrict its presence in the cane areas.
    He said he had directed the authorities to issue permits to
harvesting gangs, cane growers and sugar industry trade unions
to hold the necessary meetings in preparation for the
commencement of harvest.
    Senior representatives of the sugar cane growers had
indicated a desire to commence the crush as soon as possible,
he added.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.K. Unemployment fell a record
provisional, seasonally-adjusted 64,300 in May to a total 2.95
mln or 10.6 pct of the workforce, the Employment Department
said.
    In April, seasonally-adjusted unemployment fell by an
upwardly revised 21,600 to 3.02 mln or 10.9 pct, it said.
    The unadjusted jobless total in May, including school
leavers, alos fell a record 121,000 to 2.99 mln or 10.8 pct
from April's 3.11 mln, 11.2 pct.
    May was the eleventh successive decline from a peak last
summer of 11.6 pct, the Employment Department said.
    "Unemployment has fallen to under three mln for the first
time in over three years. The May fall of 64,000 was the
largest drop since records were first kept (in 1948),"
Employment Minister Norman Fowler said.
    All regions have seen above average falls in long term
unemployment during the past year, he added.
    The last time the adjusted total of unemployed was below
three mln was July 1984, while the unadjusted total was last
below this level in June 1983.

<TITLE>COMMONWEALTH BANK CUTS AUSTRALIAN SPLIT PRIME</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Commonwealth Bank of Australia said
it will lower its reference rate for loans to 15.75 pct from
16.25 pct and its overdraft reference rate to 16.25 pct from
16.75, effective June 24.
    Bank officials have said the bank regards the overdraft
reference rate, based on short-term rate trends, as its key
prime lending rate to corporate customers. The loan reference
rate is based on longer term trends.
    The bank is the latest to cut prime rates in recent days
following a continuing decline in market rates. Other prime
rates now range from 16 pct to 17.5 pct.

<TITLE>DUTCH PARLIAMENT BACKS STAND AGAINST OILS TAX</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROTTERDAM, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dutch parliamentary parties have
re-affirmed their support for the government's opposition to
the proposed European Community tax on oils and fats,
parliamentarians said.
    A broad cross-section of members of parliament voiced their
opposition to the tax during a debate in the lower house
yesterday on the basis of possible retaliation from the U.S.
And on the potentially damaging effect on Third World
countries.
    State Secretary for Foreign Affairs Rene Van Der Linden
said the government was against the tax although it noted
deepening EC financial difficulties.
    "It is difficult to be against the tax and against extra
finance. The EC members have to make a choice," Van Der Linden
said.
    However, he denied the government had dropped its
opposition to the proposed tax or altered its position.

unconditional its takeover bid for &lt;Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd>

Pioneer at 2.54 dlrs a share, topping CSR's cash bid of 2.50.
    CSR is also offering one share, currently worth 4.04 dlrs,

Pioneer at 2.62 per share. It holds about 33 pct of Pioneer.

<TITLE>SANDVIK, DIAMANT BOART FINALISE DRILLS MERGER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sweden's Sandvik AB &lt;SVIK.ST> and
Diamant Boart SA of Belgium, in which Societe Generale de
Belgique &lt;BELB.BR> holds an indirect 52 pct stake, have
finalised negotiations on merging oil and gas drilling tool
activities, officials of both companies said.
    Staffan Paues, President of the new Brussels-based joint
venture company Diamant Boart Stratabit SA (DBS), told a news
conference that the merged firm would be able to offer products
for all types of drilling operations.
    He said there were already signs that a slow recovery from
recession was under way in the oil and gas industries.
    "Stability in oil prices should lead to renewed investment"
Paues said.
    DBS, which Paues said began operations today, brings
together Sandvik's wholly-owned U.S. Subsidiary Strata Bit Corp
of Houston and Diamant Boart's petroleum activities in Europe,
North America, the Middle and Far East and Africa.
    Paues said the merger was a direct result of the sharp fall
in oil prices 18 months ago which led oil firms to cut back
exploration activities. Officials said the complementary
character of the two firms' operations was a further reason.

<TITLE>VESSEL LOST IN PACIFIC WAS CARRYING LEAD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The 37,635 deadweight tonnes bulk carrier
Cumberlande, which sank in the South Pacific last Friday, was
carrying a cargo which included lead as well as magnesium ore,
a Lloyds Shipping Intelligence spokesman said.
    He was unable to confirm the tonnages involved.
    Trade reports circulating the London Metal Exchange said
the vessel, en route to New Orleans from Newcastle, New South
Wales, had been carrying 10,000 tonnes of lead concentrates.
Traders said this pushed lead prices higher in early morning
trading as the market is currently sensitive to any fundamental
news due to its finely balanced supply/demand position and low
stocks.
    Trade sources said that 10,000 tonnes of lead concentrates
could convert to around 5,000 tonnes of metal, although this
depended on the quality of the concentrates.
    A loss of this size could cause a gap in the supply
pipeline, particularly in North America, they noted. Supplies
there have been very tight this year and there is a strike at
one major producer, Cominco, and labour talks currently being
held at another, Noranda subsidiary Brunswick Mining and
Smelting Ltd.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>JWT Group Inc said it filed a suit
against &lt;WPP Group Plc> to enjoin the company from continuing
its tender offer.
    The company said it charged that former JWT Group unit
executive John Peters has breached his fiduciary duty by
disclosing confidential information about the company and its
clients.
    The company said the suit, filed in New York State Supreme
Court, seeks to halt the "ongoing misuse and misappropriation
of highly confidential and proprietary information concerning
JWT and its clients.
    The defendants in the suit are WPP Group and its units and
Peters, who until January 29 was a director of J. Walter
Thompson Co, JWT Group's main subsidiary and its president and
chief operating officer.
    JWT said it asked the court to enjoin the defendants from
acquiring any further JWT stock, make them return all
confidential and proprietary information and to disgorge all
profits or other gains.
    The company said it also asked the court to award JWT
unspecified damages.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>JWT Group Inc disclosed in a filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it awarded
so-called "golden parachutes" to 26 top officers.
    The company said it granted the special bonuses, which take
effect only if an executive is fired within two years of a
successful takeover, on June 8.
    It granted 25 of the officials a severance payment of just
under three times their annual compensation if they are fired
after a takeover. For chairman Don Johnston, the payment was
limited to twice his annual compensation.
    JWT approved additional lump-sum payments of one year's
compensation to an unspecified number of other highly paid
company officials.
    The company also altered its employee retirement and stock
incentive plans, to assure continued protection and benefits
for employees in the event of a hostile takeover.
    The company did not disclose the cost of the changes made
in the severance, retirement or stock plans.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>A spokesman for Unilever Plc &lt;UN.AS>
declined to comment on market rumours that it may be
considering a bid for the U.S. Health care group The Gillette
Co &lt;GS.N>.
    Gillette shares are traded on the over-the-counter market
in London and this morning stood one dollar higher at 38 dlrs
in response to the bid speculation. Unilever dipped 33p to
3,275 in a generally depressed U.K. Market.
    Most analysts dismissed the rumours saying it was an old
story, and one commented that it was "utter rubbish," adding he
thought Unilever would not be interested in Gillette.
    Gillette shares rose sharply at the beginning of the month
on Wall Street rumours that Sir James Goldsmith was building a
stake in the company.
    Gillette has been the subject of repeated rumours since
Ronald Perelman, chairman of the Revlon Group Inc &lt;REV>, made
an unsuccessful bid for the company last year.

<TITLE>RPT - EUROPEAN TRADE MAY PROPOSE NEW ICO FORMULA</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jeremy Lovell, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    AMSTERDAM, June 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>European coffee traders and roasters
may propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee
Organization (ICO) coffee quotas at the end of their meeting
here this week, traders and officials told Reuters.
    Although traders were unwilling to reveal details of the
possible new formula, they said it would give Brazil, the
world's biggest coffee producer, unchanged ICO quotas for the
next two years and could be a basis for renegotiation.
    "The main sticking point on quotas has been Brazil's
attitude, and this compromise could be a solution, " one said.
    However, the European coffee trade federation meeting,
which began here today and is to continue to the end of the
week, has revealed gaps in the European position on
re-introducing quotas.
    Traders said that, as a whole, the trade side was against
re-introduction of ICO quotas, while roasters were generally in
favour with the single proviso that there had to be some
formula basis for re-allocating quota shares among producing
countries.
    The roasters said the positions were generally fairly
close, and problems with some Government officials.
    Germany and Italy were cited as the extremes of polarized
Government attitudes, with most other countries on the fence.
    Sources said Germany was the most extreme against quota
re-introduction, while the Italians were most in favour.
    "Nevertheless, we expect to find enough common ground by the
end of the week to at least present a common European Community
(EC) view at the next meeting of consumer members of the
International Coffee Agreement (ICA) in July," one trader said.
    "We hope we can present the compromise proposal and that not
only the consumer side, but the producer side will accept it,"
one official said.
    "We have learned that we can live without the quotas that
were suspended in February last year, but would prefer the
stability they can bring to the market as long as we do not
simply return to the old and outdated status quo as far as
quota allocation is concerned," he added.
    Overall, however, trader and roaster opinion on the
likelihood of a successful re-negotiation was mildly
pessimistic, varying between a 50-50 chance and 60-40 against.
    "Our main difficulty will be to persuade the U.S. On the
consumer side and Brazil on the producer side to agree to quota
re-introduction, " he said.
    "The U.S. Position has, if anything, hardened, while the new
Brazilian Coffee Institute president has adopted the least
negotiable position of any of his predecessors," one trader
said.
    "However, with many producers starting to swing in favour of
the consumer position that quotas have to be re-allocated under
a new formula, Brazil is becoming increasingly isolated, which
gives at least some hope of a compromise at the ICO quota
meeting in September," the official said.

<TITLE>INDONESIA REJECTS WORLD BANK FARM REFORM PROPOSALS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesia rejected World Bank
recommendations for sweeping reforms to its farm economy, as
the country's foreign aid donors met to consider giving it 2.5
billion dlrs in grants and soft loans.
    Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarks
distributed today as Indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations met
at The Hague, said, "The general argument presented by the Bank
for this free trade, open economy view is weak."
    The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages the
largest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agricultural
growth was stagnating under subsisides for rice farming.
    The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peaked
and the subsidies are a waste of money.
    Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and provides
an income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies were
needed to support the fertilizer industry, including importers,
exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well as
assisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.
    Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmers
should be free to choose their own crops, but he said the
government would continue to maintain production targets for
"strategic commodities" such as rice and sugar.
    The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia's
drive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are double
the world average because of inefficiencies, and the country
would save money by importing the commodity.
    However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the need
to save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugar
industry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.
    He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in the
agricultural sector were needed to help domestic industry
develop and because of "over-production and price intervention
in the developed nations."

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>BUDGET PACT CUTS U.S. FARM FUNDS 1.25 BILLION DLRS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. House and Senate budget
negotiators agreed as part of an overall budget accord reached
yesterday, to cut 1.25 billion dlrs from fiscal 1988 spending
on agricultural programs, Congressional sources told Reuters.
    The agreed cut in farm programs is a compromise between 1.4
billion sought by the Senate and one billion by the House.
    The negotiators also agreed to cut 1.6 billion from the
farm budget in fiscal 1989 and 2.45 billion in 1990, for a
total of 5.3 billion in saving over three years, sources said.
    The agreement presents the House and Senate Agriculture
committees with difficult choices on how to make changes in
agriculture programs that achieve the budget savings targets
without jeopardizing popular support payments, senior
Congressional aides told Reuters.
    Some farm state lawmakers already are manuevering to find
the budget savings.
    Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., Chairman of the House grains
subcommittee, has introduced a bill which would freeze wheat
and corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 2.28 dlrs
and 1.92 dlrs respectively, saying it would save 500 mln dlrs.
    House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza has
said the committee will consider the Glickman proposal.
    But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely to
be approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers and
a strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who said
freezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other major
grain export competitors and would not achieve the budget
savings Glickman claims.
    Another area where Glickman and other have said budget
savings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program,
ARP, levels for wheat and corn.
    However, on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong stand
within the Reagan administration, arguing that the 1988 crop
wheat acreage reduction should be left at 27.5 pct and not 30
pct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB. Most
commodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail.
    Congressional sources said the only way to achieve
significant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boost
the 1988 corn ARP. But one informed Congressional source said
singling-out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen as
unfair to one commodity.
    Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is most
likely to eventually look for budget savings are some
tightening of the payment limitation rules, and possible 
adoption of a 0/92 program for the 1988 crops of major grains.
    Those changes would achieve a portion of the 1.25 billion
but not enough, they said.
    Ultimately, Congressional sources said the agriculture
committees may be forced to apply an across-the-board cut on
all Commodity Credit Corp. payments to farmers, including price
support loans and deficiency payments, similar to the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986.
    This idea has been suggested by the American Farm Bureau
Federation, AFBF, as the fairest approach for all commodities.

<TITLE>OPEC DIFFERENTIALS NOT SEEN POSING MAJOR PROBLEMS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Judith Matloff, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Some OPEC states are unhappy about the
prices assigned to their crude oil but this should not pose
great problems when the group reviews its six-month-old price
and output pact in Vienna next week, oil analysts say.
    They said Nigeria, which holds the OPEC conference
presidency, and Qatar probably have the biggest grievances
about price differentials making some of their crudes
uncompetitive.
    There has also been speculation by Japanese traders that
OPEC might want to mark up prices of high-sulphur heavy crudes,
to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices.
    But most experts agree that a major overhaul of price
differentials is unlikely, so as to avoid giving the market
signals of a dent in OPEC's new unity.
    "All OPEC members can make a good case for changing
differentials," said one analyst with a major oil company. "But
at the end of the day, the attitude is going to be "leave well
alone' and little or nothing is likely to be altered."
    Iran, Libya and Saudi Arabia are among those who also saw
sales problems earlier this year, traders say. But diminished
customer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases,
marketing incentives have helped their sales.
    Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by
means of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongside
better priced grades in a "package."
    Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at least
for some part of the year. But many experts say OPEC should
change prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for
fuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. At
its last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixed
prices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel reference
point. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985
when members offered discounts to attract customers.
    OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8
mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarter
and 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extend
or raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months.
    Spot market and netback values for some crudes do not
mirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlr
target and at most make minimal changes to differentials,
analysts say.
    The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and one
non-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key export
crudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest.
Extra heavy crudes were among those left out.
    Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oil
exports actually sold at official prices. Several experts say
only one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells at
official prices, with some of the rest included in processing
or barter deals or sold in the form of refined products.
    Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year,
when some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance to
pay the new prices.
   Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude
-- now OPEC's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel --
was uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain's Brent.
    In February and March, Nigeria's production shrank below
its 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived,
due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output has
risen.
    Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and say
its price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel.
    But Mehdi Varzi, chief oil analyst with London's Kleinwort
Grieveson Securities, doubts Nigeria will actively push the
differentials question in Vienna.
    "It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria, which
holds the presidency, raised the issue," he said.

<TITLE>NEW ZEALAND BUDGET FORECAST SEEN AS POSITIVE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Analysts said they were surprised at
the government's announcement of a forecast budget surplus for
fiscal 1988 but said it was consistent with previous policy
statements and positive for the economy.
    Finance Minister Roger Douglas predicted a budget surplus
for the year ending March 1988 of 379 mln New Zealand dlrs
against a 1.95 billion deficit last year.
    Analysts polled by Reuters said the forecast budget surplus
was even more positive than the most bullish analysts'
forecasts and that this was good news for financial markets.
    Market expectations among analysts questioned by Reuters
before the budget varied widely between a balanced budget and a
2.3 billion dlr deficit. But none predicted a surplus.
    The forecast initially looks positive for both the bond and
the foreign exchange markets, one analyst said. Paradoxically,
the New Zealand dollar could rise in the medium term, despite
lower interest rates, as overseas investors became more
confident about investing in New Zealand, he said.
    However, some foreign exchange dealers disagreed, saying
the local dollar is primarily interest rate driven and will
move lower.
    The local dollar dropped to 0.5940/50 U.S. Dlrs in after
hours trading, against 0.5970/77 just before the budget
release.
    Analysts said the budget was also positive for the share
market, despite an increase in the contribution of company
taxation to revenue figures.
    One equities analyst predicted that the budget surplus
announcement could push the share market up by 50 points
tomorrow.
    The Budget statement was broadly as expected, with a
continuation of existing policies, and the absence of
traditional pre-election incentives would be viewed positively
by overseas investors, another said.
    But one merchant bank economist said that certain anti-tax
avoidance measures could damage some sectors of the share
market, particularly multi-national companies.
    The government is also lowering its borrowing requirements,
through bond tenders, as a result of the surplus. The
requirement for the rest of the year is now down to 950 mln
N.Z. Dlrs from a predicted 1.75 billion.
    Predicted revenue in the Budget looked sustainable and
there appeared to be no holding back on expenditure, another
economist said. He added that the document seemed entirely
credible.
    "Altogether it looks good for Labour's election prospects,"
he said.
    An election is due before the end of September.

<TITLE>INDONESIA REJECTS WORLD BANK FARM REFORM IDEAS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesia rejected World Bank
recommendations for sweeping reforms to its farm economy, as
the country's foreign aid donors met to consider giving it 2.5
billion dlrs in grants and soft loans.
    Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarks
distributed today as Indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations met
at The Hague, said, "The general argument presented by the Bank
for this free trade, open economy view is weak."
    The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages the
largest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agricultural
growth was stagnating under subsidies for rice farming.
    The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peaked
and the subsidies are a waste of money.
    Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and provides
an income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies were
needed to support the fertilizer industry, including importers,
exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well as
assisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.
    Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmers
should be free to choose their own crops, but he said the
government would continue to maintain production targets for
"strategic commodities" such as rice and sugar.
    The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia's
drive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are double
the world average because of inefficiencies, and the country
would save money by importing the commodity.
    However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the need
to save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugar
industry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.
    He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in the
agricultural sector were needed to help domestic industry
develop and because of "over-production and price intervention
in the developed nations."

Transmission Co Ltd said it agreed to acquire the Western
Canada oil and gas reserves and properties of AGIP Canada Ltd,
a subsidiary of AGIP SpA, part of Italy's ENI group, for 54 mln
Canadian dlrs.
    At the end of 1986, AGIP Canada reported proven and
probable reserves of 4.2 mln barrels of crude oil and natural
gas liquids and 22.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas. AGIP
Canada also holds 176,000 net exploratory acres in Western

properties.
    AGIP Canada said it would retain offshore exploration
blocks in Labrador, a gold mine in Yukon Territory and uranium
interests in Saskatchewan.

is talking with a possible fourth bidder for the company.
    The company also said Lynch Corp &lt;LGL> has renewed its
offer for Becor which was withdrawn last week.
    Talks with the possible bidder are expected to be concluded
shortly, Becor said, adding its board will evaluate all then
existing offers at that time.
    In the meantime, the company said, it plans today to
adjourn further its meeting of stockholders to June 30. That
meeting was called to act on a merger agreement calling for a

    The third identified Becor suitor is &lt;Davis Mining and

    In Fairfield, N.J., Lynch said its latest proposal calls
Lynch to own 75 pct of Becor's stock and Becor holders to
retain the other 25 pct.
    Peviously, Lynch would have held about 25 pct, with Becor
holders receiving 25 pct and Becor management about half.
    Lynch said the proposal was changed because it believes
Becor's management "needs more guidance in terms of financial

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. personal income rose 0.2 pct, or
7.9 billion dlrs, in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 3,630.0 billion dlrs, the Commerce Department said.
    The increase followed a revised 0.4 pct rise in April. The
department previously estimated April income rose 0.3 pct.
    The department also revised up the March personal income
rise to 0.3 pct from a previously reported 0.2 pct.
    Personal consumption expenditures rose 0.1 pct, or 1.5
billion dlrs, to 2,893.3 billion dlrs in May after rising 0.6
pct or 18.6 billion dlrs in April, the department said.
    The department said both the April and May increases in
personal income were restrained by lower subsidy payments to
farmers and by initial payments to a newly established
retirement fund for federal government employees in April.
    Wages and salaries increased 8.8 billion dlrs in May after
a 7.0 billion dlr rise in April, while manufacturing payrolls
were up 1.6 billion dlrs in May after falling 1.3 billion dlrs
in April.
    Farmers' incomes fell 11 billion dlrs in May after
decreasing 6.7 billion dlrs in April due to lower farm subsidy
payments, the department said.

<TITLE>U.K. DATA DEPRESS RATE CUT OUTLOOK - ANALYSTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rowena Whelan, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Today's U.K. Economic data have pushed
the chances of another base lending rate cut from the current
nine pct further into the distance, analysts said.
    A record fall in unemployment and good manufacturing
production data showed that the economy is still strong and
does not need a fillip from lower rates.
    News that underlying earnings are rising 7.75 pct annually,
taken together with higher than expected bank lending and money
supply growth, revived inflation worries and monetarist
arguments against easier credit, they said.
    "The timetable on lower interest rates is being pushed back
all the while. The strength of the economy and broad money
growth are making it more difficult to see one in the near
term," said Chase Manhattan Securities economist Robin Marshall.
    Analysts have reached this conclusion despite yesterday's
mortgage rate cuts for new borrowers, which building societies
said were a sign of the expected near term trend for U.K.
Rates.
    It also counters the optimistic forecasts of last week that
a post-general election cut was imminent, supported by such
optimistic economic news as May's record reserves rise which
mirrored the Bank of England efforts to cap sterling's
strength.
    The gilt market lost nearly half a point as enthusiasm
about May's 64,300 fall in the seasonally adjusted unemployment
rate, to 2.95 mln or 10.6 pct of the workforce, was rapidly
replaced by dismay at the continued high level of underlying
average earnings in April, dealers said.
    The upset was compounded by news that sterling bank lending
rose 2.7 billion stg in May, above forecast, and that the Bank
of England looks likely to have to sell more gilts to offset
the impact on domestic money supply of its current
intervention.
    "The gilt market reaction was correct," said Bill Martin,
chief U.K. Economist at brokers Phillips and Drew.
    "That's very important ... It shows the economy in a very
good state indeed," Skeoch said.
    "There's no reason to get worries about inflationary
pressures because they're very subdued." Unit wage cost rises
were better than expected, just one pct higher in the year to
April, and it was these costs rather than average earnings
which were potentially inflationary, he added.
    "I don't think these average earnings numbers are a major
problem," agreed Chase Manhattan's Marshall.
    But he said the gilts market was likely to remain worried
about the funding implications of recent intervention.
    He said the inflow of foreign money into sterling assets
earlier this year, attracted by growth prospects and hopes that
the ruling Conservatives would win last week's election, now
looks likely to prevent a base rate cut as the authorities try
to prevent these funds swelling the domestic money system.
    However, David Owen, U.K. Economist at Kleinwort Grieveson
Securities, said any fresh sterling strength would still
trigger a base rate cut and that today's figures did not signal
higher inflation this year.
    "Wage increases are being offset by productivity growth. As
long as that continues we're okay," he added.

<TITLE>FED GOVERNOR SEGER SEES CURRENCY STABILITY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha
Seger said there were signs of helpful stability in foreign
exchange markets in recent weeks.
    "I think we are beginning to see more calm in those markets,"
Seger told reporters after a speech to the U.S. League of
Savings Institutions.
    "I think it is very healthy when you can get into a period
of stability," she said.
    She said market forces have a major influence on exchange
rates and said she did not know the right value for the dollar
against the Yen or the Mark.
    Seger told the Savings and Loan executives that she was
concerned about financial markets' absorption with exchange
rate influences.
    "I am concerned that we have gotten so nervous," about
exchange rates, Seger said.
    She said the Fed takes into account additional factors in
determining monetary policy than the value of the dollar
against other currencies.
    On the economy, Seger called the latest figures in gross
national product a modest upward revision.

Department of Transportation's Office of Public Counsel has
urged that expedited non-hearing procedures be used in its
proposed acquisition of Piedmont Aviation Inc &lt;PIE>.
    The company said that America West Airlines Inc &lt;AWAL.O>
was the only party voicing opposition to the acquisition.  The
Department of Transportation had asked parties to submit
statements by June 17 either supporting or opposing the
acquisition.
    USAir said it and Piedmont again requested expedited

    The company said the Office of Public Counsel could find no
evidence that the acquisition would substantially lessen
competition in any market.

<TITLE>ARCO &lt;ARC> SPIN-OFF SEEN AT 500 MLN DLRS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Samuel Fromartz, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Atlantic Richfield Co, considering a
spin-off of a 20 pct interest in its chemical operations, could
gain about 500 mln dlrs from the deal, industry analysts
estimated.
    Yesterday ARCO's stock jumped as much as five points on
rumors it was spinning off the chemical operations. Based on
about 183 mln outstanding shares, the market in its frenzy was
valuing the spin-off at about 900 mln dlrs, analysts said.
    Atlantic Richfield, aware of the rumors, issued a statement
around mid-day that it was considering a sale of only 20 pct of
the unit, leading investors to take profits.
    After the announcement, the company's stock retreated,
closing at 93-7/8, up 1-3/8. Today it was off 1/4.
    "It was a smaller deal than expected and somewhat
disappointing," said analyst George Baker at Smith Barney. He
said rumors of the spin-off had been around "for a couple of
days."
    Baker said the unit was very profitable but it wasn't
getting the type of exposure Atlantic Richfield sought, and its
value was not reflected in the company's stock price.
    Industry analyst Richard Pzena of Sanford C. Bernstein said
the unit had operating earnings of 132 mln dlrs last year and
he expected it to earn about 175 mln dlrs this year.
    Based on a multiple of 17 times earnings--which Pzena says
chemical companies now sell for--the entire unit is worth about
three billion dlrs, putting the 20 pct interest at around 500
to 600 mln dlrs.
    Pzena said he thought the company was selling the stake
because chemical margins had peaked, and he speculated the
company would use the proceeds to pay down debt.
    But he added the possibility remained the deal would fall
through. Yesterday, ARCO said the proposal had not yet been
presented to its board.
    The chemical unit last year had revenues of 1.9 billion
dlrs.

<TITLE>DUTCH CONSUMERS/INDUSTRY SEE VEG OILS TAX THREAT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    THE HAGUE, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dutch consumers and food processors
would be hit hard by the proposed EC tax on oils and fats, Dick
de Bruyn, chairman of the commodity board for margarine, fats
and oils, MVO, said at the annual meeting.
    The Dutch are the second largest consumers of margarine and
fourth largest consumers of vegetable oils in the EC.
    The fiercely contested tax would be a levy on consumers and
steeply increase the costs of industries such as potato
processing and cake and biscuit manufacturing, de Bruyn said.
    "A move by these industries to countries outside the EC
cannot be ruled out," he added.
    De Bruyn said the tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats
would be wide open to fraud, difficult to police, and hugely
expensive administratively.
    He also said the proposed tax contravened not only article
three of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the
Lome Convention, and the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) guidelines, but also the EC's own Treaty.
    The proposed tax would not only be inflationary but also
have consequences for employment and investment, he added.

government securities market to supply reserves via either a
large round of customer repurchase agreements or by overnight
or possibly four-day system repurchases, economists said.
    They said the Fed has a fairly large add need and is likely
to face the most reserve dislocations early in the new
statement period started today as corporate tax payments swell
Treasury balances at the Fed.
    Fed funds hovered at 6-3/4 pct after averaging 6.80 pct
yesterday.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The International Monetary Fund said
it has loaned Uganda 92.1 mln dlrs to aid in economic recovery.
    The fund said 60 mln dlrs of the loan is available through
the so-called structural adjustment facility (SAF) over the
next three years.
    The fund said 57.5 mln dlrs will be available immediately
under the SAF and a separate financing arrangement.
    After expanding in the early 1980's, Uganda's economy has
suffered setbacks since 1984 of falling industrial and
agricultural output and accelerating inflation, the fund said.
    The current economic downturn has been worsened by the
sharp decline in the world price of coffee, Uganda's major
export, the fund said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>EC COMMISSION DEFENDS OILS AND FATS TAX</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ****ANTWERP, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>A spokesman for the European
Community Commission defended the controversial plan for a levy
on oils and fats, saying that consumers would have to help
alleviate the surplus problem by paying the proposed tax.
    Norbert Tanghe, head of division of the Commission's
Directorate General for Agriculture, told the 8th Antwerp Oils
and Fats Contact Days "the Commission firmly believes that the
sacrifices which would be undergone by Community producers in
the oils and fats sector ... Would justify asking consumers to
make an appropriate contribution to solving the serious problem
within that sector by paying a levy."
    The proposed tax is necessary because the level of
budgetary costs resulting from olive oil and oilseeds
production has become unacceptable, Tanghe said.
    Recent estimates put these costs at 4.0 billion European
Currency Units and by 1990 they would rise by another 2.0
billion Ecus, he said. In 1990 the Community's "standstill"
agreements with Spain and Portugal end and the EC would then
feel the full impact of its enlargement.
    The Commission has proposed several cost and production
cutting measures which include the introduction of a maximum
guaranteed quantity system, he added.
    Under the Commission's system for stabilising consumer
prices in the oils and fats sector, a reference price of 700
Ecus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced, Tanghe
said.
    Consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatory
amount when market prices are below or above this level.
    He said the revenue generated by charging a regulatory
amount would be used to finance the Common Agricultural
Policy's oils and fats regime.
    "The Commission believes that hostile reactions (to the
proposed tax) have for the most part been based on incomplete
or an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal," he said.
    Tanghe said the proposed system conforms with General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, rules.
    It would not be discriminatory because it would be applied
to domestic and imported products, and past experience showed
it would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats.
    EC-produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they do
under present aid arrangements, he said.
    The competitiveness between different oils, whether EC
produced or imported, would remain unchanged and quantities
imported from third countries would not be affected by the tax,
Tanghe said.
    The proposed system would not alter the EC nations'
requirements as far as imports are concerned since the overall
effect would stabilise Community production levels without
affecting demand, he said.
    It is one of the proposal's objectives to maintain current
import levels, he said.
    Imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they are
imported primarily to satisfy the EC's cakes and meals
requirements, which are not covered by the stabilising system.
Furthermore, more than half the oil produced from imported
beans is re-exported to third countries, Tanghe added.

<TITLE>STEEL FIRMS STUDY USX &lt;X> UNIT PRICE HIKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Two major steel companies said they
were studying a price increase announced yesterday by USX
Corp's USS steelmaking division.
    Spokesman for Armco Inc &lt;AS> and Bethlehem Steel Corp &lt;BS>
said the proposed price hike was under study.
    Yesterday, USS said it plans to raise base prices on plate
products by 20 dlrs a ton, or about five pct, effective with
shipments October 4.
    A spokesman for LTV Steel Co, a unit of LTV Corp &lt;QLTV>,
declined comment, adding that the company does not make heavy
plate and makes few other plate products.
    A spokesman for &lt;National Steel Corp>, a joint venture of
National Intergroup Inc &lt;NII> and Nippon Kokan K.K., said the
company is not in the product lines affected.
    Reached later, an Inland Steel Industries Inc &lt;IAD>
spokesman said the company was studying the pricing move.
    USX said the increase will be on all plate products,
including carbon, high-strength low-alloy, strip mill and alloy
plates. It also said it planned 20-dlr-a-ton increases on some
special plate widths and thicknesses.
    Analysts have said firm prices for steel should contribute
to better results at the nation's major steelmakers.

<TITLE>U.K. COURT RULES AGAINST RTZ ON OIL FIELD COSTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.K. High Court dismissed an appeal
by Rio Tinto-Zinc Corp Plc's &lt;RTZL.L> RTZ Oil and Gas Ltd unit
and ruled that the financial provisions a company makes for the
future cost of abandoning an oil field are not tax deductible,
the Press Association reported.
    The company was appealing against a decision of the Tax
Commissioners that any such provision was a capital
expenditure, not a revenue expenditure, and was not deductible.
The court was told that since 1976 the company had made an
annual provision of around 750,000 stg for the eventual cost of
abandoning a rig.
    An RTZ spokesman said the ruling was not worrying as the
subsidiary had assumed that the provisions were not deductible
from corporation tax payable.
    It would have been a bonus if the company had won but all
budgeting had been on the assumption that it would not, he
said.
    Oil analysts said that RTZ's assumption of liability was
shared by the industry as a whole.
    The ruling appeared to mean that tax relief on the
expensive process of abandoning rigs would apply when the
expense occurred, not when provisions for future expenses were
built into the accounts, one analyst added.

<TITLE>INDONESIAN DEBT SERVICE RATIO PEAKS, MINISTER SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    THE HAGUE, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesia expects the recent years'
rise in its debt service ratio to peak at the current level of
41 pct, Development Supervision Minister Ali Wardhana told
journalists.
    He was speaking at a news conference following a two day
annual meeting of aid donors grouped in the Inter-Governmental
Group on Indonesia (IGGI) in which 3.15 billion dlrs in fresh
funds were pledged for the coming year.
    "The current debt service ratio of 41 pct will be the top,"
Wardhana said, noting the debt service ratio rose to that level
from 37 pct last year. Indonesia's debt totals 37 billion dlrs.
    "The current debt burden will be manageable if concessionary
loans can be attracted," he said.
    He said international organisations such as the World Bank
pledged an unchanged 1.68 billion dlrs in fresh funds to
Indonesia and this year's overall total, up from last year's
2.6 billion, reflected higher pledges from donor countries.
    He said Japan raised its pledge to 88 billion yen from 80
billion last year. Britain almost trebled its contribution to
130 mln stg from 45 mln. The United States raised its
contribution to 190 mln dlrs from 86 mln and the Netherlands
raised its figure to 232 mln guilders from 180 mln.
    Commenting on the increase in funds pledged to Indonesia,
which has been hard hit in export revenue due to the oil price
collapse, Wardhana said, "I am happily surprised, but in view of
the seriousness of the balance of payments situation the amount
is what we needed to cope."
    He noted donors pledged to increase local cost financing as
part of the aid package. Some 900 mln dlrs of the package will
be for programme aid or local cost financing, Indonesian
Central Bank Governor Arifin Siregar said.
    Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh said Indonesia will continue
to reform the economy and bring about further liberalisations.
    "Indonesia has undertaken reforms to meet external problems,"
Saleh said. "It's a good thing and we will continue with
deregulation in trade, industry and licensing of new
businesses."
    Asked whether the question of private capital exports from
Indonesia was discussed, central bank governor Arifin Siregar
expressed confidence that any drain of capital abroad would
only be temporary.
    He noted there had been a turnaround in a recent fall in
foreign exchange reserves three days ago.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>GROWTH OF PALM OIL USE SET TO SLOW, OUTPUT TO RISE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ANTWERP, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The rate of increase in world palm oil
use is likely to slow next season despite an expected 800,000
tonne production rise to 8.13 mln tonnes, Siegfried Mielke,
editor of the Hamburg-based newsletter Oil World said.
    He told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days that in
the next Oct/Sept 1987/88 season, palm oil use will rise to
8.25 mln tonnes from 7.71 mln, below the five-year average
increase of 550,000 tonnes.
     Opening stocks at the start of next October are expected
to be about 1.4 mln tonnes, 300,000 tonnes below year-earlier
levels, bringing total supplies to 9.5 mln tonnes, he said.
    The anticipated total supplies will be about 500,000 tonnes
above this season's available amount, Mielke said.
    The increase in mature palm tree areas in Malaysia will
slow down from this year on, but that will be offset by area
expansion in Indonesia, he said.
    He estimated the combined rise in Malaysian and Indonesian
mature area at 8.7 pct next year, after 9.5 pct this year, and
at 6.7 pct in 1989 and 5.0 pct in 1990.
    Malaysia also is shifting plantings to Sabah and Sarawak,
where the rate of expansion is higher than in the Peninsula,
but where yields are lower, he said.
     The stocks/usage ratio of seven major oils is also
expected to decline, Mielke said. The oils are soybean,
cottonseed, sunflowerseed, coconut, rapeseed, palmkernel and
palm.
    At the start of October 1986 stocks of these oils were
unusually high and represented 6.8 weeks of the current
season's prospective demand, compared with six weeks a year ago
and with 5.4 weeks in 1984, he said.
    Mielke expects the ratio to fall to 5.9 weeks by the start
of next October and to the unusually low level of 5.4 weeks by
the end of next season.
    The stocks/usage ratio for palm oil was 11.4 weeks last
October and is likely to be 8.7 weeks next October and 7.7 at
the end of next season, Mielke said.
    World oilseed stocks also are expected to fall in the
course of the next season, with the biggest reduction seen in
soybean stocks, which Mielke expects to decline by 5.0 mln
tonnes or by one fifth.
    Almost all of the decline is expected to occur in the U.S.,
for which he estimated ending stocks next season at 10.7 mln
tonnes, or 393 mln bushels, against anticipated ending stocks
of 15 mln tonnes, or 551 mln bushels, at the end of this
season.

Mexico 400 mln dlrs to help support an agricultural credit
project.
    The project hopes to increase agricultural productivity,
exports, and real farm income by providing credit to private
farmers, ranchers and agro-industries, the bank said.
    The loan will be used for lending mainly by commercial
banks and the National Rural Credit Bank, Mexico's largest
agricultural credit lender, the bank said.
    It also said the project hopes to aid in reducing the
government's interest rate and credit subsidies.
    The project will also support improvement of the
agricultural credit system through reduction of subsidies for
credit and crop insurance, and increased domestic resource
mobilization, the bank said.
    The loan, guaranteed by the government, is for 15 years,
including three years of grace, at a variable interest rate -
currently 7.92 pct, the bank said.

<TITLE>EUROPEAN COMMUNITY CRITICISES U.S TRADE MEASURES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GENEVA, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community (EC) accused the
United States of violating a political commitment to free trade
through practices including a tax on imported gasoline and a
customs user fee.
    EC ambassador Tran Van-Thinh made the formal charge to the
surveillance body of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT), GATT spokesman David Woods told reporters.
    Woods also said the EC was joined by the United States in
criticising Brazil for extending its list of products for which
import licenses have been temporarily suspended, so as to
improve its balance of payments.
    The United States charged Japan with violating GATT rules
by restricting imports of agricultural products through an
import licensing system. The United States asked for
consultations with Tokyo on the issue.
    Tran charged that the trade measures contravened a
political commitment to halt and reverse trade barriers,
pledged by ministers in Punta del Este last September.
    When ministers established the four year Uruguay round to
negotiate freer trade in 13 areas, they set up the GATT
surveillance body to monitor this commitment, known in GATT
jargon as "standstill and rollback."
    Tran criticised Washington for the "superfund" tax on oil
imports, a customs user fee, and the removal of a special
machine tool (known as category FSC34) from its government
procurement list for reasons of national security.
    Warren Lavorel, a U.S. Trade official, defended the
policies, saying they did not violate GATT trade rules.
    The surveillance body will send a record of today's talks
to the Trade Negotiating Committee, which oversees the round,
to decide any further action on the charges.
    The oil tax and customs user fee have already been the
subject of formal GATT dispute panels set up outside the
Uruguay Round to rule on the legality of the practices.
    The ruling GATT Council yesterday adopted a dispute panel's
report and ruled that the U.S. Superfund tax on oil imports
breached trade rules. It called on Washington to modify its
legislation.
    Mexico and Canada, along with the European Community,
brought the dispute to the GATT last year.

<TITLE>COMMITMENTS TO NEW ARGENTINE LOAN REACH 91 PCT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Commitments to Argentina's external
financing program for 1987 and 1988 have reached about 91 pct
of the 1.95 billion dlrs in new loans that banks have been
asked to provide, Citibank and Argentina said in a joint
statement.
    This percentage is close to the "critical mass" of
commitments that the International Monetary Fund has requested
as a condition for releasing new loans to the country.
    Senior Citibank executive William Rhodes said he was
encouraged by the banks' response and that telexed commitments
continue to arrive.
    The response of Argentina's 350 foreign bank creditors had
been eagerly awaited because the package is the first to be
marketed since U.S. banks, led by Citibank, decided to take
large second-quarter losses in order to boost their reserves
against existing loans to developing countries.
    Some bankers had feared that banks would refuse to lend new
money so soon after taking a "hit" on the old loans, but
today's news delivers a decisive rebuff to those skeptics.
    The strong response to the package was partly the result of
the inducement of a 3/8 pct early-participation fee for those
banks that agreed to sign up by June 17, bankers said.

<TITLE>ZAMBIAN COPPER INDUSTRY HOPES FOR STEADY OUTPUT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Buchizya Mseteka, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LUSAKA, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Zambia's copper mining industry is hoping
to achieve and maintain production at over 500,000 tonnes a
year in the next few years despite low world prices,
deteriorating ores and shortages of mine inputs, industry
officials said.
    But Zambia's decision to abandon last May 1 a tough
International Monetary Fund (IMF) economic recovery program has
introduced an element of uncertainty into plans to restructure
the ailing industry and boost profitability, they said.
    Copper production by the government-controlled Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) for the 1987 financial year
ended March 31 improved slightly to about 471,000 tonnes from a
record 1986 low of 463,354 tonnes.
    "We are convinced that by the end of the 1988 financial
year, copper production could well be over 500,000 tonnes due
to greater availability of spares and equipment," a ZCCM
official said.
    ZCCM officials said the production of cobalt, another
strategic income earner, will also be tailored to meet demand.
    Finished production in 1986 was 4,565 tonnes, 911 tonnes
higher than the previous year and the best production achieved
to date.
    Protracted low world metal prices have badly hit the copper
industry in Zambia, the world's fifth biggest producer. Mining
is monopolised by ZCCM and accounts for about 90 pct of the
country's foreign exchange earnings.
    Production has also been seriously affected in recent years
by equipment breakdowns, deteriorating ore and shortages of
spare parts, fuel and lubricants. The 463,354 tonnes output
last year compared with a peak 1975 output of 700,000 tonnes.
    A five-year production and investment plan launched in 1984
by ZCCM is being funded by the European Community, the African
Development Bank and the World Bank.
    The plan foresees the shutdown of some seven mining and
metallurgical units on the grounds they are unprofitable.
    ZCCM, the second largest employer after the government, has
said it intends to lay off 20,000 of its 60,000 workforce as
part of the plan.
    More than 250 mln dlrs have so far been channelled into the
industry in a bid to improve efficiency and profitability under
the five-year restructuring plan.
    Company officials said although reserves were being
depleted, Zambia could continue to produce copper beyond the
end of the century, though at lower levels of production.
    Industry sources said ZCCM's projected pre-tax profit for
the financial year ended March 31 would be around 500 mln
kwacha. But with the current mineral export tax level being
levied, a net loss is likely to be registered.
    ZCCM recorded a net loss of 718 mln kwacha in 1986 compared
with a net profit of 19 mln kwacha the year before.
    Under the foreign exchange auction system introduced in
1985, ZCCM's profits from its foreign exchange earnings rose as
the value of the kwacha fell to 21 to the dollar from just over
two to the dollar.
    But on May 1, President Kenneth Kaunda abolished the
auctioning system, inspired by the International Monetary Fund,
and announced Zambia would pursue a go-it-alone economic
strategy based on national resources.
    ZCCM officials are still cautious over what effects the
break with the IMF will have on the industry's plans.
    "We are still consulting to see how the new measures will
affect us but it is too early to say just how we shall fare
under the new situation," Peter Hansen, director of operations
and third in the ZCCM hierarchy, told Reuters.
    Some analysts believe the new officially-fixed exchange
rate of eight kwacha to the dollar will hit ZCCM's export
profits.
    "Most specialists I have talked to tell me the break-even
point for ZCCM is a rate of 10 kwacha per dollar," Frederick
Chiluba, leader of the Zambian Congress of Trade Unions said.
    High production costs continue to bedevil the Zambian
industry.
    Zambia mines copper at a relatively expensive rate of 69
cents per pound, compared with 55 cents in the United States
and under 40 cents in Chile.
    The industry also faces transport problems due to Zambia
being landlocked. The government confirmed this year it had
stopped sBending copper south through South Africa.
    Over 80 pct of shipments, some 35,000 tonnes a month, are
sent by rail to the Tanzanian port of Dar-es-Salaam, while
5,000 tonnes go via Zimbabwe to the Mozambique port of Beira.
Transport has often been hit by shortages of wagons, spares and
fuel.

    The Rio dockers did not get support from their colleagues
in Santos, Brazil's main port, but the spokesman said they
would not return to work unless their demands were met.
    Earlier this week, some 65,000 dockworkers cancelled a

them a wage increase and other benefits.
    A Rio port spokesman said the halt would cause daily losses
of about 100,000 U.S. dlrs.

<TITLE>TANZANIA RAISES FUEL PRICES,TAXES IN 1987/8 BUDGET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DAR ES SALAAM, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Tanzanian government, in its
second annual budget since embarking on an economic recovery
program inspired by the International Monetary Fund, announced
increases in fuel prices and sales tax and higher levies on
government services.
    Finance Minister Cleopa Msuya said the government expected
to spend 77.33 billion shillings in the financial year 1987/8,
39 pct more than this year's estimate. Revenue would provide
48.84 billion shillings, leaving a deficit of 28.49 billion to
be financed through domestic and foreign loans.
    This year's budget initially projected a deficit of only
3.35 billion shillings but in mid-year the government had to
impose new taxes to keep the deficit roughly on target. No
figure for the final deficit was avaialble.
    The budget gave civil servants a 20 pct pay rise with
effect from July 1, to compensate for inflation of more than 30
pct.
    Msuya said regular petrol would go up 52 pct, with similar
increases in the cost of premium and kerosene. Diesel would
rise by 75 pct.
    The higher levies affect official transactions such as road
tolls, vehicle transfers and various licence fees, he added.

    He said an auction of coffee would raise additional money

<TITLE>U.S. SAID UNFAIRLY PROTECTING DEFENSE INDUSTRY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Britain's Defence Minister George Younger
said the U.S. Was unfairly protecting its defence industry, and
this could lead to British firms demanding counter-measures.
    Younger told a U.S. Chamber of Commerce meeting that U.S.
Legislators were failing to realise "the true nature of the
two-way street in terms of ideas, technology and equipment.
    A British parliamentary report said that up to March
British firms had been awarded just 34 mln dlrs worth of
contracts for the Strategic Defence Initiative, compared with
the 1.5 billion dlrs Britain had hoped to secure.
    The committee said U.S. Technology export restrictions and
"selectiveness" towards foreign contractors had denied British
competitors more lucrative orders and largely excluded them
from technological research for SDI.
    Younger said London had given U.S. Companies contracts
under conditions of fair and open competition. "All we ask is
for our companies to be given similar opportunities," he added.
    If new American legislation aimed at curbing unfair
subsidies was used to exclude foreign suppliers it would not be
surprising if British firms pressed for retaliatory measures,
Younger said.

<TITLE>WEST TEXAS COTTON CROP UNSCATHED BY STORM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The West Texas cotton crop was largely
unscathed by an isolated thunderstorm in that region last night
that packed hurricane-force winds, crop and weather experts
said.
    "There might have been some isolated storms, but certainly
nothing damaging," said Charles Stichler, an extension
agronomist with the Agricultural Extension Service in far West
Texas.
    Rumors of a damaging storm in West Texas helped the New
York cotton futures market rally sharply this morning.
   Cotton for December delivery was 1.35 cents higher at 70.95
cents a lb at midsession after peaking this morning at 71.25
cents.
    "What happened is that the storm hit Lubbock airport, and
when that happens, everybody sees it," said Dale Mohler, a
senior meteorologist with Accu-Weather Inc.
    Lubbock is the heart of the West Texas cotton region, which
produces about 80 pct of that state's crop.
    The storm produced winds of about 75 mph. "That's hurricane
force. But they were isolated to just a small portion of the
West Texas area, probably less than five pct," Mohler said.
    "No doubt there was some damage. But if it had hit in July
or August (when fruiting would be underway) it would have been
worse," Mohler said.
    About 60 pct of the West Texas cotton crop has been
planted, and the remainder could be done by the weekend if
weather remains hot and dry, Stichler said.
    The temperature in West Texas since mid-week has been about
95 degrees. But a hot spell was sorely needed after far heavier
than normal rainfall for several weeks, he said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The World Bank said it has extended
Pakistan 220 mln dlrs in three loans to support projects in
education, energy conservation and modernization, and
small-scale industry development.
    The education project will be supported by a 145 mln dlr
loan through the International Development Association, the
bank's concessionary lending affiliate, the bank said.
    The bank noted Pakistan's low educational attainment,
particularly among women, is an obstacle to the country's
development.
    It said the education project aims to increase literacy and
school enrollment rates through curriculum reform, teacher
training, parental participation and school construction.
    A small-scale industry development project will be
supported by a 54 mln dlr loan, the bank said.
    The project hopes to aid small-scale industry by
encouraging bank lending, developing export markets, and
supporting technology transfer, the bank said.
    The third project, to improve refinery efficiency, reduce
energy consumption and increase crude oil processing capacity,
will be supported by a 21 mln dlr loan.

    The 30,000-member mainly black Chemical Workers Industrial
Union said it fears the planned move to the Bophuthatswana
homeland, where South African unions are not recognised, could
lead to job losses and affect wages.
    A mass dismissal last year at the Impala Platinum Holdings
Ltd &lt;IPLA.J> mines in the tribal homeland sent world platinum
prices rocketing.

    The union said talks with management over the proposed move
had broken down. It said an earlier ballot of refinery workers
showed that most favoured striking over the move but added that
no final decision had been taken on strike action.
    The refinery processes all platinum metals of Rustenburg
Platinum Holdings Ltd, the world's largest platinum producer.
    It is owned by Matthey Rustenburg Ltd, a joint-subsidiary
of Johnson Matthey and Rustenburg which, in turn, is owned by
mining group Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Co Ltd.

<TITLE>BANK OF AMERICA SEES SLOW U.S. CONSUMER SPENDING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAN FRANCISCO, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>A trade-led boom in the U.S. is
unlikely this year or next because growth in net exports will
merely offset a dramatic slowdown in consumer spending and
other sectors of the economy, Bank of America said in its
latest economic report.
    Although net exports will add 0.7 pct to GNP this year,
after reducing it by 1.2 pct in 1986, consumer spending will
contribute 1.4 pct less to GNP than it did last year.
    As a result, GNP this year is likely to expand a modest 2.5
pct, the same rate as last year, according to Daniel Van Dyke,
the Bank of America economist who wrote the report.
    "Growth in consumer spending in the United States will drop
dramatically this year because the jump in inflation will cause
a falloff in the growth of disposable income," Van Dyke said.
    Growth in U.S. consumer spending is likely to slow to 1.8
pct this year from 4.1 pct in 1986, he predicted.
    The report was released before the Commerce Department
reported today that personal income rose just 0.2 pct in May,
after increasing 0.4 pct in April, and that personal
consumption expenditures had risen just 0.1 pct, compared with
a 0.6 pct increase the month before.
    The rising cost of energy and imports is likely to boost
consumer prices by an average of 3.7 pct this year, up from 1.9
pct in 1986, Bank of America forecast.
    This rise in inflation will reduce real disposable income 
growth to only 1.3 pct in 1987 from 2.9 pct in 1986.
    As a result, Van Dyke calculated that the purchasing power
of an average family of four will increase by a modest 540 dlrs
this year compared to a surge of 1,210 dlrs during 1986.
    The slowdown in income growth is likely to cause housing
starts to drop by 4.2 pct this year and a further six pct in
1988 to an annual rate of 1.63 mln units.
    "For the first time in several years, a recession in 1988
or 1989 is more than a remote possibility," Van Dyke said.
    Currently, U.S. growth is fragile and depends heavily on an
improvement in trade. "However, with protectionist attitudes on
the rise in this country, this source of growth is at risk," he
added.

<TITLE>BROOKLYN UNION&lt;BU> SEEN HURT BY PIPELINE CLOSURE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By NAILENE CHOU WIEST, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brooklyn Union Gas Co, a New York gas
utility, will see its gas costs up sharply as a result of
Transco Energy Co's &lt;E> decision to close its pipelines to
transport spot gas sales, energy industry analysts said.
    Brooklyn Union, the fourth largest gas utility in the
United States, purchased 36 pct of its supplies on the spot, or
non-contract, market in 1986, and the proportion of spot
supplies was estimated much higher in the five months of 1987,
analysts said.
    Texas Eastern pipelines &lt;TET>, the other competing
pipeline, to deliver spot gas from producing areas in the South
closed its gate station for summer, and Brooklyn Union has
relied entirely on Transco for spot supplies.
     In the month of May, Brooklyn Union paid about two dlrs
per mln British Thermal Unit for spot gas, while contract gas
costs four to five dlrs per mln BTU, industry sources said.
    Transco announced yesterday it would no longer provide open
access to transport spot natural gas to its customers for fear
of accumulating more take-or-pay liabilities.
    Take-or-pay contracts oblige pipelines to pay producers for
gas even if delivery is not taken by its customers.
    Brooklyn Union will continue receiving a small amount of
supplies from minor fields under a grandfather clause, a
Brooklyn Union official said.
    Foster Corwith, gas analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said
most of the rising cost to Booklyn Union will be passed through
to rate payers.
    While net effect on the company will not be known for
several months because of the time lag in deferred earnings,
end-users, especially residential and commercial customers,
will end up paying more for gas, he said.
    Because the closure takes place in summer months when gas
demand is at seasonal low, the impact on cash flow would be
small, Curt Launer, natural gas analyst with Donaldson Lufkin
Jenrette, said.
    If the situation persists into winter heating season, high
cost gas could cut in the company's profits, he said.
    Gas utilities along eastern seaboard relying on Transco for
spot gas, such as North Carolina Natural Gas Co &lt;NCNG>,
Piedmont Natural Gas Co &lt;PNY>, will face the same high cost
factor as Brooklyn Union, Steve Richards, a supply manager with
end users supply system, a Houston based natural gas brokering
firm, said.
    "But these companies are not unwitting victims of the
take-or-pay dispute between Transco and producers," he said.
    Distributors have turned a deaf ear to Transco's request
for an inventory charge, which reserves the pipeline facility
for spot gas to be delivered to these companies, he said.
    Without spot supplies, the high cost of system gas will
threaten to drive away large customers capable of shifting to
alternative fuels, he said.
    In absence of any guidelines on inventory charges from the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the matter is being
negotiated between pipelines and customers, Richards said.
    Now that Transco has refused to transport cheap spot gas
for them, these distributors are likely to be more conciliatory
on the inventory charge, he said.
    "Cool heads will prevail," DLJ's Launer said, " but it may
take a while."

    Reynolds said work will commence on the potline restart in
the near future and it is expected that actual metal production
will begin on September one.
    The company said the start up was necessitated by
continuing strong demand for aluminum and dwindling worldwide
inventories, and that the metal is needed to supply Reynolds'
various fabricating businesses.

intervened in a High Court hearing in an attempt to prevent the
presentation of internal Council documents as evidence.
    The intervention in Shearson Lehman's action against the
London Metal Exchange over its "ring out" of tin contracts in
1986 is likely to have implications for other cases in which
the Council is involved following the collapse of its buffer
stock operations in October 1985, ITC delegates said.
    The ITC's case is being presented by Professor Rosalyn
Higgins and is expected to take a further one or two days next
week. Court does not sit tomorrow.
    In essence the Council is claiming that its status is
similar to that of a foreign embassy and that its archives can
therefore not be used in an English court of law.
    The Council ended its quarterly session today ahead of
schedule. The meeting had been expected to go on until tomorrow
when the European Community's legal advisers were due to
attend, but delegates reviewed the progress of the various
legal actions today.
    Otherwise, the meeting was occupied with internal
administrative matters, delegates said.
    The ITC will continue to operate with a reduced staff after
June 30 following the two year extension of the sixth
International Tin Agreement.
    As well as dealing with the ongoing litigation, the Council
will continue with its statistical work and carry out some
research studies, although staffing in the research department
is being cut to one from two previously.
    At this week's session the Council elected Philip Sparkes
of Australia as first vice-chairman for the producing members
and Heinz Hofer of Switzerland as second vice-chairman for the
consumers for the year from July 1. Future quarterly sessions
are scheduled for October 5/7 and December 14/16.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The World Bank said it approved a
97.4 mln dlr loan for China to help boost fertilizer output in
order to increase agricultural production.
    The 20-year loan supports a project aimed at improving the
efficiency of medium-scale fertilizer plants through technical
renovations and energy conservation, the bank said.
    It said the project also seeks to reduce agricultural
nutrient imbalances by building the capacity for phosphate
fertilizer production and to improve institutional efficiency
by introducing modern economic, financial and operational
systems and techniques.

<DATELINE>    RICHMOND, Va., June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Reynolds Metals Co said it plans
to restart the last idle potline at its Troutdale, Ore.,
primary aluminum plant.
    With the restart of this 22,700 tonne a year production
line, Reynolds said it will be operating at 100 pct of its
consolidated primary aluminum capacity of 695,000 tonnes per
year.
    Reynolds said work on the restart will begin in the near
future and it is expected that actual metal production will
begin September 1.
    The company said the start-up was necessitated by
continuing strong demand for aluminum and dwindling worldwide
inventories, and that the metal is needed to supply Reynolds'
various fabricating businesses.

<TITLE>GILLETTE &lt;GS> SEEN OBJECT OF GLOBAL BIDDING WAR</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ronald Perelman, head of Revlon Group
Inc &lt;REV>, may be trying to ignite a bidding war for Gillette
Co that could draw some big international players and in the
process make a lot of money for himself, Wall Street analysts
said.
    Several hours before a regularly scheduled board of
directors meeting, Gillette disclosed that Perelman requested
consent of its board for an offer of at least 40.50 dlrs per
share. Perelman needed the consent because he agreed in
November not to buy stock for 10 years without permission.
    "I think Ronald Perelman is less interested in Gillette and
more interested in putting Gillette into play because he stands
to make a ton of money," said Andrew Shore, analyst at Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc. "In play" is a term used on Wall Street to
describe what happens when a company becomes an unwiling
takeover target.
    Shore noted that according to the 1986 agreement Revlon
gets paid if there is any acquisition of Gillette through
November of this year at a price higher than 29.75 dlrs per
share. Gillette rose three to 40 today, following a gain of
three yesterday.
    The agreement would be calculated on the basis of
Perelman's previous holding of 18.4 mln shares, adjusted for a
split. For example, a deal between Gillette and some other
company at 44 dlrs per share would make Revlon richer by 262
mln dlrs under the formula. Neither Perelman nor his spokesmen
returned telephone calls seeking comment.
    "Revlon stands to make a substantial amount of money if
someone else takes over Gillette," said Analyst Deepak Raj of
Merrill Lynch and Co. "I'm not saying that is going to happen
but Gillette is an undervalued stock with a breakup value of 45
dlrs per share."
    Shore of Shearson Lehman said there are a couple of reasons
why Perelman may not be really interested in acquiring
Gillette. He said Perelman, in the process of taking Revlon
private after acquiring control of the cosmetics company two
years ago, probably wants to concentrate on improving Revlon's
operations. "He's trying to overhaul and improve the image of
the dearptment store business." Another reason is that Revlon
has recently made two other acquisitions.
    Under those circumstances, Shore would not be surprised if
some company such as Unilever plc &lt;UN.AS> or Procter and Gamble
Co &lt;PG> decided to take a look at Gillette.
    Shore mentioned half a dozen other potential buyers for
Gillette including Sir James Goldsmith, Hanson Trust plc &lt;HAN>,
RJR Nabisco Inc &lt;RJR>, American Brands Inc &lt;AMB> and Ralston
Purina Co &lt;RAL>.
    "Perelman is trying to put the company in play," said a
Wall Street arbitrageur. "He gets to share in the upside if the
company is sold." Another arbitrageur said he expects Gillette
to resist Perelman's overture. "I can't see the board
consenting, what has changed between November and now," he
said.
   
    Another arbitrageur said he was not sure what was going on.
"Perelman never does anything without a fair amount of
calculation," he said. But he added, "The Gillette board has to
be careful. They just can't say no or they'll be sued by
shareholders." Gillette's board was still meeting at 1700 EDT,
three and one-half hours after the scheduled starting time.
    According to a copy of Perelman's letter released by
Gillette, he would be prepared to sign a defnitive merger
agreement without any financing condition. He said Citibank
N.A. is his lead lender and First Boston Inc is his financial
adviser.

<DATELINE>    LIMA, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Peru's state minerals marketing arm, Minero
Peru Comercial SA (Minpeco), lifted a force majeure on zinc
ingot shipments from the country's biggest zinc refinery at
Cajamarquilla, a spokesman said.
    The spokesman said the problems affecting sulphuric acid
and roaster plants that had halted production since May 4 had
been resolved.
    However, he said production of zinc ingots this year was
expected to fall to around 86,000 tonnes this year at
Cajamarquilla, from 94,000 tonnes in 1986 because of the
stoppage.
    The refinery has an optimum annual production capacity of
100,000 tonnes but its highest production was 96,000 tonnes of
refined zinc ingots in 1985, the spokesman said.

<TITLE>SENATOR DEFENDS U.S. MANDATORY FARM CONTROL BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, defended his
controversial mandatory supply control farm bill and said U.S.
farmers should be allowed to vote in a referendum whether they
approve of the proposal.
    The Harkin proposal would set loan rates of 5.17 dlrs per
bushel for wheat, 3.77 dlrs for corn and 9.32 dlrs for
soybeans, all to be put in effect under strict controls on
planted acreage reductions. Present loan rates are 2.28 dlrs
for wheat, 1.92 for corn, and effectively 4.56 for soybeans.
    Also under the plan, the U.S. would seek a world market
sharing cartel with the European Community and other exporting
nations, to share-out export markets, Harkin said during the
first of several Senate Agriculture subcommittee hearings
examining farm programs.
    Harkin made the following claims in testimony on his
"Family Farm Act."
    -- The mandatory control bill would increase farm income
and reduce government spending on agriculture.
    -- Harkin said his policy of high price supports would not
ruin U.S. agricultural exports as critics claim, but would
increase overall revenue from exports.
    This would be done by seeking agreement among major
exporting countries including the European Community on market
sharing at agreed high prices.
    Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., countered during the hearing
that such a grain export cartel is not workable.
    -- Harkin acknowledged that higher commodity price supports
would be passed onto consumers, but he said high food prices
stem more from "gouging" by food processing companies than from
high farm product prices.
    Harkin cited what he termed "excessive" net returns on
equity over five years of 33.4 pct at Kellogg, 31.9 pct
Monfort, 22.8 pct Nabisco, 22.8 pct ConAgra, 21.2 pct H.J.
Heinz, 19.1 pct Ralston Purina, 17.2 pct Pillsbury and 16.7 pct
Quaker Oats.
    -- Harkin said a "legitimate" concern about his bill would
be the impact of higher prices on livestock producers.
    He said as a transition to the higher prices, he would
allow livestock producers to purchase Commodity Credit Corp.
grain stocks for three years.
    Thereafter, livestock farmers would benefit from a
"predictable and stable" grain price, he said.
    -- Harkin said that under his policy approach farm
participation would be no more "mandatory" than the current
farm program. He said farmers now must participate in farm
programs in order to receive credit for planting and to protect
farm income.

    Blair also said that Nova has made no decision as to
whether it would want to be lead partner in a joint purchase of
Dome.
    He added that some of the discussions with other parties
about Dome included TransCanada PipeLines Ltd &lt;TRP>, but
refused to name the other participants.

<TITLE>OECD SEES GERMAN GROWTH HIT BY LOW DOMESTIC DEMAND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German economic growth will slow to
1.5 pct this year from 2.4 pct in 1986 due to weak domestic
demand and tougher competition from abroad, the Organisation
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said in its
semi-annual review of the world economy.
    This view is less favourable than the West German
government's forecast of a growth rate of under two pct this
year, but is in line with forecasts by independent economic
institutes of growth ranging from 1.5 to two pct.
    The OECD said that the economy should pick up next year,
with the gross national product rising by two pct in real
terms.
    The OECD said it assumed the German economy was passing
through a period of temporary weakness and there would be some
recovery in business confidence in the near future.
    But it warned that the key to an improvement in the economy
was higher domestic demand, which is only forecast to rise by
2.5 pct this year and 2.75 pct in 1988, below 1986's 3.7 pct.
    While noting that the government is bringing forward a five
billion mark tax reform to January 1988, the OECD said that "the
medium to longer-term performance of the West German economy
could be improved by reduction of subsidies - which would allow
relatively lower tax rates."
    Since the OECD report was compiled, the West German Federal
Statistics Office has released figures showing that the GNP
actually fell 0.5 pct in real terms in the first quarter of
this year compared with the final three months of 1986.
    Diplomatic sources here said that West Germany appeared
likely to finish the year with the lowest growth rate of any of
the Group of Seven leading industrial nations.
    West Germany's current account surplus, the target of
considerable criticism by the Reagan administration, is
expected to rise slightly to 37 billion dlrs this year from
35.8 billion in 1986, before declining to 29 billion dlrs in
1988.

<TITLE>HIGHER GROWTH, UNEMPLOYMENT IN FRANCE, OECD SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>France's growth rate is expected to
strengthen in the second half of this year after a poor first
half, but unemployment will worsen, the Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.
    In its semi-annual review of the world economy, the OECD
forecast that growth in the French Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
would run at about two pct in the next six months. It said the
rate would be in line with the 1986 trends, but significantly
higher than in the first half of this year.
    The OECD said France's economic situation has deteriorated
somewhat during the early months of 1987. 
    Activity has slowed, primarily reflecting an inventory
adjustment, while unemployment has risen rapidly and inflation
has reaccelerated, the OECD said. Unemployment is likely to
reach 12 pct of the workforce by the end of 1988.
    The report said inflation should slow and domestic demand
pick up in the second half of this year. But both data are
likely to be worse than those recorded in 1986, it added.
    The OECD forecast a 2.75 pct rise in consumer prices for
the second half of this year, a one pct drop from the first six
months. The slowdown would bring the inflation rate to 3.25 pct
for the whole year, sharply up from last year's 2.2 pct.

<TITLE>ITALIAN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK LESS BRIGHT, OECD SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Italy's economic outlook for 1987 and 1988
is likely to be less favourable than last year with slightly
lower growth, higher unemployment and an increased trade
deficit, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) said.
    But the OECD, in its half-yearly report, forecast a
slightly lower inflation rate over the next two years. Last
year Italy ranked as one of the OECD's fastest growing
economies with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth at 2.7 pct.
    The OECD said Italy's GDP may grow by three pct in 1987,
but will then fall back to 2.5 pct in 1988.
    The inflation rate will probably stabilise at around five
pct during the projection period as a result of a turnaround in
import prices, particularly oil, an acceleration in labour
costs and the effects of domestic demand pressure, the report
said.
    This year, and to a lesser degree in 1988, domestic demand
should be stimulated by buoyant growth in household consumption
made possible by wage increases following pay negotiations.
    Domestic demand pressure, coupled with the deterioration in
Italian competitiveness, is likely to stimulate imports and
adversely affect exports in 1987 and 1988. This could result in
a sharp negative contribution to the currrent account.

<TITLE>JAPAN TRADE SURPLUS WILL GROW AGAIN IN 1987, OECD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's trade surplus is likely to
continue to grow in 1987, as sales of Japanese goods abroad
increase while domestic demand remains sluggish, the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
said.
    In its latest half-yearly review of the world economy, the
OECD said Japan managed to considerably reduce its surplus last
year, when domestic demand grew by four pct in 1986 while
export markets rose by only two pct.
    But it said this differential between the growth of
domestic and foreign demand would reverse in 1987 and 1988,
"thus weakening the international adjustment process."
    It forecast a slowing in domestic growth to little over two
pct but with a rise in exports of 3.3 pct in 1987 and 3.6 pct
in 1988. As a result, the current account surplus in 1987 will
rise to 95 billion dlrs from 86 billion in 1986, although in
1988 it should fall back to 87 billion dlrs.
    The OECD outlook did not take account of the 6,000 billion
yen package announced last month to stimulate domestic demand
and increase imports to Japan. However, OECD officials said the
measures will significantly strengthen domestic demand, quite
possibly exceeding one pct GNP when the full effects have
worked through, and thus will provide some stimulus to imports.
    The OECD outlook said, "Continued large current account
surpluses and the further build-up of an already-substantial
net external asset position could well lead to upward pressure
on the yen." It said that further appreciation could then lead
manufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thus
weaken domestic growth.
    The OECD said Japan's Gross National Product was likely to
gorw an annual two pct in 1987 and 1988, below 1986's 2.5 pct
growth. But it said Japan would continue its good performance
on inflation, with a zero figure expected in 1987 compared to a
0.6 pct rise in consumer prices last year.

<TITLE>U.S.-CANADA TIES SEEN WORSE WITHOUT TRADE PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S.-Canadian ties could worsen if
the two nations are unable to reach a free trade pact,
according to a study published by two nonpartisan public policy
research groups.
    The Cato Institute of Washington and the Fraser Institute
of Vancouver said removing the remaining tariffs on cross
border trade would benefit both countries.
    But Cato chairman William Niskanen added "the two nations'
generally harmonious trade relations are probably not
sustainable without a new agreement."
    The United States and Canada, whose cross-border trade
totaled about 125 billion dlrs last year, have been holding
talks since last June on a pact to end the few trade barriers
remaining between their two countries.
    The U.S. put a deadline on the talks of October 1, but both
sides have said an agreement is likely despite tough bargaining
remained.
    Niskanen said if no pact is reached, bilateral trade ties
could deteriorate because of Congressional pressure on
President Reagan to implement trade laws more aggressively, and
this could hit some Canadian trade practices.
    He noted Canada is seeking foreign investment in its auto
industry, which could put strains on the considerable bilateral
free trade in U.S. and Canadian autos and parts.
    Niskanen also said the Canadian government is vulnerable to
a resurgence of economic nationalism which could restrict U.S.
exports to Canada.
    A free trade pact, backed by President Reagan and Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney, would open new markets for Canada and
enable its industries to achieve economies of scale, which
would also help it widen exports worldwide, he said.
    It would also increase the gross national products of both
countries.
    Niskanen said the goal of a pact should be to end all
tariffs within 10 years, lower subsidies on exports, set rules
for trade in services and investments, end curbs on government
procurement and agree ways to resolve trade disputes.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC GROWTH SEEN SLUGGISH IN BENELUX COUNTRIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Economic growth will remain sluggish in
the Netherlands and Belgium next year and unemployment may
rise, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
forecast.
    Belgium's GDP growth may slow down to 1.5 pct this year and
next year, bringing a rise in the number of jobless, the OECD
said in its semi-annual survey. Belgian inflation could
stabilise at 1.5 to 2.0 pct, while the current account surplus
will probably remain large at about three pct of GDP.
    While the Belgian government has made progress in trimming
its borrowing requirement, "it will probably be insufficient to
check the self-sustaining nature of the deficit," the OECD said.
    In the Netherlands real GDP growth will also slip to 1.5
pct this year and one pct in 1988, with Dutch exports becoming
less competitive and imports rising. "Employment is forecast to
decelerate as well, reflecting more sluggish growth in the
private sector and budgetary cuts," the report said.
    Dutch consumer prices are set to fall by 0.5 pct in 1987
and stay stable in 1988, partly as a result of declining
domestic gas prices.
    Luxembourg's economy, by contrast, will see slightly faster
growth in GDP this year as a result of an upward movement in
wages. But real growth in consumption will ease next year.

<TITLE>SOUTHERN EUROPE HAS STRONG DOMESTIC DEMAND GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Strong growth in domestic demand was a key
feature of the economies of southern European countries in
1986, though the growth is seen slowing this year and next, the
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said.
    In its semi-annual report, the OECD said Portugal's total
domestic demand growth would decline from 7.6 pct last year to
five pct in 1987 and 3.75 pct in 1988 as slower wage growth
restrained private consumption.
    Turkey's economy grew much faster than expected in 1986 and
domestic demand surged 10.5 pct, but this growth was expected
to be halved to five pct next year.
    In Spain, buoyant domestic demand, led by fixed investment,
had been the driving force behind rapid growth in Gross
Domestic Product. Both fixed investment and private consumption
were expected to ease during 1988 but would still remain
strong.
    The OECD forecast that Spanish imports would rise sharply
next year, reflecting strong demand, entry to the European
Community and declining competitiveness.
    In Greece, inflation was forecast to turn downwards
following an increase early this year linked with the
introduction of Value Added Tax and a surge in food prices due
to cold weather.

<TITLE>OECD SAYS HIGH WAGE DEALS HARMING NORDIC STATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>High wage settlements in Nordic countries
threaten to cut exports and reduce the international
competitiveness of their industries, the Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.
    In Denmark, the OECD said wage settlements concluded in
early 1987 were likely to contribute to a marked deterioration
in competitiveness. Sweden's competitive position was also seen
at risk from accelerating wages.
    The OECD predicted that domestic demand would come under
pressure from tight fiscal policy in Denmark, as well as
Norway, Sweden and Finland.
    Overall economic growth will vary in the different
countries between 1986 and 1988, the OECD semi-annual report
said.
    After a strong rise of 7.8 pct in 1986, total domestic
demand in Norway was seen falling by 1.5 pct in 1987 and one
pct the following year. Denmark was also expected to see a
slump in domestic demand. The report said growth in Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) was likely to speed up slightly in
Sweden and Finland in 1987 and 1988, while declining in Denmark
and Norway.
    Iceland needs to try harder to implement its new economic
strategy if any more progress is to be made towards sustained
and balanced non-inflationary growth, the OECD said.

<TITLE>OECD URGES ACTION TO CUT U.S. BUDGET DEFICIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States should take urgent
action to cut its crippling budget deficit, including possible
reductions in non-defense spending, higher taxes and curbs on
growth of the defense budget, the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development said.
    The OECD, in its semi-annual review of the world economy,
said a failure of the Reagan Administration and Congress
quickly to agree on measures to cut the deficit "could seriously
affect confidence, both in the United States and elsewhere."
    It predicted that the federal deficit in fiscal 1987,
running until September 30 this year, would substantially
overshoot both the Balanced Budget Act's target of 144 billion
dlrs and official U.S. Estimates in February of 175 billion.
    "The OECD projection, which is based on assumptions of
slower growth, higher interest rates and actual data for the
first half of the financial year, is for a deficit of about 190
billion dollars," it said.
    While this would be 30 billion lower than last year's
deficit, much of the improvement would be due to corporate tax
increases being introduced before income tax cuts take effect.
    The U.S. Economic growth rate is expected to edge up to
2.75 pct next year from 2.5 pct this year and last.
    In contrast to the last two years, more competitive exports
boosted by the fall in the dollar should help GNP growth.
    Unemployment should continue to fall slowly as the service
sector continues to create jobs. But inflation appears to be
heading higher, partly due to the lower dollar, with consumer
prices forecast to rise four pct this year and 4.5 pct next
year after just 2.1 pct in 1986.
    "Monetary and fiscal policy appear to be the key factors
behind the avoidance of recession," the report said.
    The current account balance of payments deficit is expected
to be still around a high 125 billion dlrs next year, after
hitting a projected record 147.25 billion this year, it said.
    In Canada economic growth is expected to pick up slightly
to around 2.75 pct in 1988 from 2.5 pct this year, but will
still be below levels seen in recent years. Inflation is
expected to slow to 3.5 pct next year from 3.75 pct this year,
unemployment should edge down to nine pct in 1988 from 9.25 pct
this year.
    Canada's current account deficit is projected to shrink to
around four billion U.S. Dlrs this year and to remain at about
that level in 1988.

<TITLE>JOINT ACTION SAID VITAL TO BOOST WORLD GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Prospects for world economic growth remain
very sluggish, and coordinated action by western governments is
urgently needed to restore business confidence, stabilize
currencies and encourage investment, the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said here.
    "The economic situation has deteriorated in recent months,
and ... Slow growth, high unemployment and large payments
imbalances are likely to persist," it said in one of its
gloomiest reviews of the world economy in recent years.
    The gross national product (GNP) of the 24-nation bloc of
western industrialised countries is forecast to grow by only
2.25 pct both this year and next, even slower than last year's
2.5 pct growth rate.
    "We would like to see the aggregate for the OECD area
comfortably exceeding three pct," David Henderson, head of the
OECD's economics and statistics department, said.
    The OECD said that the dollar fall had led to rising
inflation expectations and higher interest rates in the U.S.,
Combining with world trade imbalances and the huge third world
debt problem to increase the risks of a world economic
downturn.
    "At the same time, many of the conditions for faster growth
remain favorable," it said, citing low inflation in most major
countries, healthy corporate finances, generally lower interest
rates, improvements in state budget positions and more flexible
labor markets.
    But private sector confidence had been undermined by
uncertainties over exchange rates, it said, and warned that "for
confidence to be restored, it is important for governments
swiftly to implement internationally-agreed commitments."
    This was a clear reference to last February's Louvre accord
of the Group of Five nations plus Canada, analysts said.
    The OECD said that apparent disagreements among major
countries on implementation of the Louvre accord had helped to
undermine business confidence, and called on more active fiscal
policies from the U.S., West Germany and Japan to slow demand
in the U.S. And raise it in the other two countries.
    Henderson said the 6,000 billion yen package announced
recently by the Japanese government to encourage public works
and cut taxes would make a significant contribution to this
process, though it was too early to estimate its precise
impact.
    He said the measures will help strengthen Japan's domestic
demand significantly, quite possibly exceeding one pct of GNP.
    The inflation outlook, while broadly satisfactory, has
worsened in recent months, with OECD consumer prices forecast
to rise 3.5 pct this year and 3.75 pct in 1988 after a 2.8 pct
increase in 1986.
    There is no prospect for any significant improvement in the
unemployment situation over the next 18 months, with the
average rate expected to stabilize at 8.25 pct, similar to last
year.
    The OECD called for efforts to liberalize world
agricultural markets through switching farm subsidies away from
price guarantees and other measures linked to production
towards direct income support for farmers.

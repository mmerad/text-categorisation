<TITLE>INCO SEES NO MAJOR IMPACT FROM DOW REMOVAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>Inco Ltd said it did not expect its
earlier reported removal from the Dow Jones industrial index to
make a major impact on the company's stock.
    "We don't think that individuals or institutions buy our
shares because we were one of the Dow Jones industrials,"
spokesman Ken Cherney said in reply to a query.
    Inco closed 1-3/8 lower at 19-3/8 in second most active
trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
    The Wall Street Journal, which selects the index, said Inco
was dropped to make the index more representative of the
market. Inco, the non-Communist world's largest nickel
producer, was a member of the index since 1928.
    Replacing Inco and Owens-Illinois Inc will be Coca-Cola Co
and Boeing Co, effective tomorrow.
    Nickel analyst Ilmar Martens at Walwyn Stodgell Cochran
Murray Ltd said Inco's removal from the index would likely
spark short-term selling pressure on the stock.
    "Some investors who have Inco may suddenly say, 'well,
because it's not now a Dow stock, we should eliminate that
investment,'" said Martens, although he added the move was
unlikely to have a serious long-term impact on Inco stock.
    Inco has struggled in recent years against sharply lower
nickel prices. Its net earnings fell to 200,000 U.S. dlrs in
1986 from 52.2 mln dlrs the previous year.

<TITLE>U.S. ECONOMIC DATA KEY TO DEBT FUTURES OUTLOOK</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Brad Schade, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. economic data this week could be
the key in determining whether U.S. interest rate futures break
out of a 3-1/2 month trading range, financial analysts said.
    Although market expectations are for February U.S. retail
sales Thursday and industrial production Friday to show healthy
gains, figures within or slightly below expectations would be
positive for the market, the analysts said.
    "You have to be impressed with the resiliency of bonds
right now," said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig
Sloane.
    Treasury bond futures came under pressure today which
traders linked to a persistently firm federal funds rate and a
rise in oil prices. However, when sufficient selling interest
to break below chart support in the June contract failed to
materialize, participants who had sold bond futures early
quickly covered short positions, they said.
    "Everyone is expecting strong numbers, and if they come in
as expected it won't be that bad for the market," Sloane said.
    Sloane said the consensus estimate for the non-auto sector
of retail sales is for a rise of 0.6 to 0.7 pct.
    Dean Witter analyst Karen Gibbs said a retail sales figure
below market forecasts would give a boost to debt futures, and
she put the range for the non-auto sector of retail sales at up
0.8 to 1.2 pct.
    Industrial production and the producer price index Friday
both are expected to show increases of about 0.5 pct, she
added.
    Retail sales "will tell us whether or not we will be able
to fill the gap," Gibbs said, referring to a chart gap in June
bonds between 100-26/32 and 101-3/32 created Friday. June bonds
closed at 100-4/32 today.
    Also key to debt futures direction, in addition to the
federal funds rate, is the direction of crude oil prices, said
Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures analyst Brian Singer.
    "A higher fed funds rate and firm oil prices precluded the
market from breaking out of the trading range the last time the
market approached the top of the range," Singer said.
    In order for bonds to break above the top of the range,
which is just below 102 in the June contract, "the crude oil
rally needs to run its course and pull back a little bit,"
Singer said. "Fed funds are already easing back down toward the
six pct level."
    The recent surge in oil prices has also been a concern to
Manufacturers Hanover Futures analyst Jim Rozich, but the rally
may be nearing a top around 18.50 dlrs per barrel, he said.
    Rozich said he is looking for the June bond contract to
ease to 99-6/32 and find support.
    "I'm not quite ready to jump on the bullish bandwagon yet.
The jury is still out this week," Rozich said.

<TITLE>UNUSUAL TEXAS INSTRUMENTS &lt;TXN> PREFERRED PRICED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>In a novel type of financing, Texas
Instruments Inc marketed a three-part, 225 mln dlr issue of
convertible money market preferred stock through Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc as sole manager.
    Shearson, which originated the new convertible concept,
said each of the three tranches totaled 75 mln dlrs. In the
first, a 2.85 pct dividend was set on the stock with a strike
price of 190 dlrs that represented a 15 pct premium over the
common stock price when terms were set.
    Also included were 4.36 pct dividend preferred with a 220
dlr strike price and 33 pct premium and 4.49 pct dividend
preferred with a 235 dlr strike price and 42 pct premium.
    Texas Instruments common closed at 167.25 dlrs, up 2-1/8.
    Ronald Gallatin, managing director at Shearson, said that
"demand for the offering was unbelievable, especially for the
first tranche."
    He said that Shearson originated the concept of auction
money market preferred stock three years ago. The conversion
feature of this issue is the new wrinkle.
    Commenting on the first tranche, Gallatin noted that the
original pricing talk called for a dividend in the four to 4.20
pct area. This was gradually cut to 2.85 pct because of intense
demand, saving the issuer money in financing costs.
    The Shearson official said that virtually all buyers of the
first tranche received less than they wanted. He said the
latter two tranches were less strongly oversubscribed.
    Like non-convertible money market preferred stock, the new
version allows investors to redeem their holdings every seven
weeks. Investors then can maintain their holdings, sell them,
or offer to hold on to the securities if the auction
dividend is at least at a level they specify in advance.
    Gallatin said the securities were sold to a broad range of
investors, including major insurance companies, banks, money
managers and pension funds.

<TITLE>FASTER TEST FOR SICKLE CELL ANEMIA DEVELOPED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>   BOSTON, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>A team of California researchers said
that they have developed a better, faster test for detecting
sickle cell anemia in unborn children than existing procedures.
     The test, developed by Cetus Corp &lt;CTUS> researchers,
requires only a small amount of genetic material from a fetus
and produces a diagnosis within a day, unlike other tests that
require several days and can only be done in a few specialized
centers, they said.
     Sickle cell anemia is a painful, inherited blood disease
that causes the normally-flexible red blood cells to stiffen
into a sickle-like shape. It is primarily found in blacks.
    The researchers said in The New England Journal of Medicine
that their "procedure promises to be a rapid, sensitive and
reliable method for the prenatal diagnosis of sickle cell
disease."
     In addition, they said, the technique might also be
adapted to detect other types of genetic disease.

<TITLE>USX &lt;X> PROVED OIL, GAS RESERVES FALL IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>USX Corp said proved reserves of oil
and natural gas liquids fell 28 pct to 802.8 mln barrels at the
end of 1986 from 1.12 billion barrels at year-end 1985.
    The figures, in USX's just-released 1986 annual report,
indicate much of the drop resulted from the exclusion of 293.7
mln barrels of Libyan reserves, after the U.S. government last
June directed U.S. oil companies to end Libyan operations.
    USX, which owns Marathon Oil Co and Texas Oil and Gas Corp,
had 60 pct of its 1986 sales of 14.94 billion dlrs from its oil
and gas operations.
    About 24 pct of total sales came from USX's USS steel unit
and 16 pct from diversified businesses, which include oilfield
services, raw materials, minerals, chemicals and real estate.
    According to the report, domestic liquids reserves fell
slightly to 628.5 mln barrels from 628.9 mln and foreign
reserves fell to 174.3 mln from 486.4 mln barrels. The large
drop in foreign reserves was in the Middle East and Africa,
where they fell to about 9.3 mln barrels from 316.7 mln,
reflecting the exclusion of Libya.
    Total natural gas reserves fell to 4.82 trillion cubic feet
at year-end 1986 from 5.18 trillion at the end of 1985.
    Again, most of the drop came from the Middle East and
Africa, where reserves fell to zero from 71.9 billion cubic
feet, excluding Libyan reserves.
    U.S. natural gas reserves fell to 3.44 trillion cubic feet
from 3.65 trillion and foreign reserves fell to 1.38 trillion
from 1.53 trillion.
    In other areas, USX said total capital spending fell to 962
mln dlrs in 1986 from 1.78 billion dlrs in 1985. The 1986
audited figure is eight mln dlrs higher than the unaudited
figure the company reported on Jan 27.
    USX also said it expects to record a gain of 150 mln dlrs
in 1988, representing 50 pct of previously existing investment
tax credits allowable under the new tax law. The loss of the
other half of the credits was reflected in the fourth quarter.
    In a discussion of steel results, USX said plants that were
shut down last month and some previously idled plants may be
permanently closed. USX took a fourth quarter charge of 1.03
billion dlrs to restructure its steel operations. The charge
included the "indefinite idling" last month of four plants in
Utah, Pennsylvania and Texas.
    Other plants or parts of plants in Pennsylvania, Indiana,
Alabama, Ohio and Chicago had been previously idled.
    "These operations are not permanently shut down. Improved
market conditions for the products from these plants may make
it feasible to reopen some of them," USX said in the report.
    "On the other hand, a lack of any future market improvement
may necessitate their permanent closing," it added.

<TITLE>PHILLIPS&lt;P> SAYS STOCK UP ON STEPS TO PARE DEBT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>Phillips Petroleum Co Chairman C. J.
"Pete" Silas said his company's stock, ranked fourth on the
most active list of stocks traded today, rose partly because of
steps it took to pare its debt.
    Silas told Reuters in an interview today, "part of this
strength results from the rise in oil prices and also because
some of the analysts have been happy with the steps we've taken
in 1986 to pare our debt."
    Phillips stocks rose 1/4 to 14 dlrs a share following
recommendations by some oil analysts, a company source said.
    Phillips debt stood at 5.9 billion dlrs in December 1986
down from a 1985 high of 8.6 billion dlrs, analysts said.
    "At 14 dlrs a share, Phillips is priced closer to the actual
price of oil," he added.
    Silas said, "if the analysts are right that oil prices will
rise to 20 dlrs or higher, then it seems to make sense to buy
Phillips." He is, however, more cautious about the strength in
crude prices, expecting the price to fluctuate between 16-18
dlrs a barrel for the year.
    Oil industry analysts said one reason for the stock's
popularity of the stock is that it traded at a strong discount
to its appraised value and was attractively priced for small
investors.
    Charles Andrew, an analyst who follows Phillips for John S.
Herold Inc of Greenwich, Conn said that the appraised value of
the company, based on available data is 34.25 dlrs.
    "The stock is trading at about 1/3 its appraised value. The
company has tremendous leverage and if it can get its act
together and if oil prices are steady to higher there is good
room for improvement," he said.
   But, he added, "if oil prices turn lower, there will be a
lot of pressure on Phillips."
   Phillips' shares fell as low as eight dlrs a share over the
last 52 weeks with a 1987 low of 11-3/4 dlrs in 1987.   
Analysts say that the appraised value of the company could be
revised due to asset sales of their oil and gas reserves.
   Silas told Reuters that the asset sales which amount to
about two billion dlrs for 1986 were completed and that none
were planned.

<TITLE>MICHIGAN GENERAL &lt;MGL> BEGINS EXCHANGE OFFER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SADDLE BROOK, N.J., march 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>Michigan General Corp said
it began an exchange offer for its 110 mln dlrs outstanding
principal amount of 10-3/4 pct senior subordinated debentures
due December 1, 1998.
    Pursuant to the exchange offer, each 1,000 dlr principal
amount will receive 500 dlr principal amount of senior
subordinated notes due March 1, 1992, 200 dlr principal amount
of non-interest bearing convertible senior subordainted notes
due March 1, 1997 and 12 shares of delayed convertible
preferred stock, liquidation preference 25 dlrs per share.
    The offer will expire April nine.
    Michigan General said the exchange offer is crucial to is
attempt to restructure and reduce its risk from Chapter 11.
    The principal purpose of the offer is to reduce its debt
service on the 10-3/4 pct debetures, increase stockholders'
equity and induce its lender to continue to fund.
    Assuming a 90 pct acceptance of the offer, Michigan's
annual cash interest requirements will be reduced by about 10.6
mln dlrs, it said.
    Completion is subject to the tender of at least 90 pct of
the debentures and its lender to waive it from default under
its loan agreements.

It said it did not know when distributions would be made.
    It earlier reported that operating profit for first quarter
ended January 31 fell to 273,000 dlrs from 1.7 mln dlrs the
previous year.
    For full-year 1986 ended October 31, the bank posted an
operating loss of 4.4 mln dlrs against year-earlier profit of
7.5 mln dlrs. The bank also posted a 66 mln dlr extraordinary
loss in fiscal 1986.
    Bank of British Columbia sold most of its assets last
November to HongKong Bank Canada, a unit of &lt;HongKong and
Shanghai Banking Corp>, of Hong Kong, for 63.5 mln dlrs.
    It said efforts to wind up the bank's affairs were
proceeding as quickly as possible.
    The bank said it expected to report positive earnings in
future periods, barring unforeseen circumstances.
    Loan losses, which the bank previously said figured in its
move to sell off most of its assets, rose to 105.7 mln dlrs in
fiscal 1986 from year-earlier 36.1 mln dlrs. The bank said 31.1
mln dlrs of the 1986 total represented downward adjustments to
its portfolio of syndicated sovereign risk loans as required
under the sale to HongKong Bank.
    Since November 27, the bank has confined activities to the
winding up of affairs, Bank of British Columbia said.

<TITLE>U.S. HOUSE PANEL TAKES FIRST TRADE BILL VOTES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jacqueline Frank</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>House trade lawmakers took their
first votes on measures designed to toughen U.S. trade laws but
held over until tomorrow the most difficult votes on
controversial plans to protect American industries.
    Meeting in closed session, the House Ways and Means Trade
Subcommittee failed to resolve one of the most sensitive issues
in the bill--whether they will force major foreign trading
partners to severely cut their trade surpluses with the United
States.
    The subcommittee is considering a toned-down version of
Democratic-sponsored trade legislation that aims to open
foreign markets but which drops last year's effort to force
President Reagan to retaliate with quotas or tariffs.
    Congressional aides who asked not to be identified said the
lawmakers intend to wrap up their proposals tomorrow and will
consider a proposal to mandate retaliation without setting
specific trade penalties.
    The legislation faces another hurdle in the full Ways and
Means Committee next week before the full House votes on it.
    Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat who is seeking
his party's 1988 presidential nomination, said he may offer an
amendment to call for reductions in the trade surpluses of
those countries with barriers to imports of U.S. goods.
    This would be a moderated version of his earlier plan to
force a mandatory ten per cent annual cut in the trade surplus
with the United States by Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, West
Germany and other countries with the largest trade imbalances.
    "My criteria for a good amendment sets a standard for
getting the trade deficit down," he told reporters.
    The trade law changes are to become part of a major
congressional and administration effort to turn around the
record U.S. trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last year by
opening up foreign markets and making U.S. products more
competitive.
    House Speaker James Wright, a Texas Democrat, said again
today he expects the full House will approve the trade bill by
May and that Reagan will accept the final congressional bill.
    "I expect whatever is reported (by the Ways and Means
Committee) will pass. We will have a good bill and an effective
bill," he told reporters.
    The comprehensive trade bill will include work by other
committees to ease export controls on high technology, to aid
U.S. workers displaced by foreign competition, to stimulate
research and development, to remove foreign trade barriers and
to improve education and worker training.
    The lawmakers agreed that for the first time a U.S.
industry could charge foreign producers with unfair competition
if they deny basic worker rights such as collective bargaining,
safety rules and payment of a minimum wage appropriate to the
country's economic development.
    They transferred to U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter the powers now held by Reagan to decide whether to
retaliate against foreign violations of fair trade rules and
whether an injured industry deserves import relief.
    They agreed to make it easier for a company to get
temporary relief from import competition but agreed the
industry should provide a plan to become competitive.
    The administration has not announced its support but
Yeutter said yesterday, "I am cautiously optimistic," that the
Democratic-led House will come up with an acceptable bill.

<TITLE>SOVIET MINISTER SAYS TRADE BOOST UP TO FRENCH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>Soviet first deputy prime minister
Vsevolod Murakhovsky said at the end of a brief visit here his
country wanted to boost joint business with France, but that a
reduction of France's trade deficit with the Soviet Union
depended on the French.
    Murakhovsky, who is also chairman of the State
Agro-Industrial Committee (GOSAGROPROM), told a news conference
he had discussed a variety of possible deals with French
companies Rhone-Poulenc, Pechiney and Imec.
    Declining to put figures on possible contracts he said he
had discussed plant protection and the processing of highly
sulphuric gas with Rhone-Poulenc, packaging technology for
agricultural products with Pechiney, and fruit and vegetable
juice processing with Imec.
    An official for Pechiney said an agreement of intent on
packaging could be signed soon, but could not give any other
details. The other two companies were not immediately available
for comment.
    Asked whether he foresaw a reduction this year of France's
trade shortfall, at 7.6 billion francs in the first 11 months
of 1986 against 5.1 billion for the whole of 1985, Murakhovsky
told Reuters: "It all depends on France."
    At a meeting in Paris last January French and Soviet
foreign trade ministers said they were committed to increased
efforts to reduce the deficit. Estimates at the time showed a
French 190 mln franc surplus for December 1986.
    Murakhovsky said the Soviet Union was prepared to talk with
anybody with "interesting" proposals offering latest technology
and assuring "a mutual advantage."
    He said the Soviet Union had many tasks ahead of it and
would deal rapidly with proposals it considered interesting.
    He encouraged companies to take advantage of new laws
guaranteeing "the interests of foreign partners" in joint
ventures.
    But he said no agreements had yet been finalised under the
new joint venture laws.
    He said concrete deals had not yet been finalised as a
result of a one billion dollar accord signed in Moscow last
month with French businessman Jean-Baptiste Doumeng.
    He said Doumeng's Interagra company was preparing proposals
for further examination by the Soviet Union. Doumeng last month
said the agreement was to exchange one billion dollars worth of
goods.
    Murakhovsky said the agreement was one of intent, and
designed primarily to renew and increase the Soviet Union's
food production capacity.

<DATELINE>    Caracas, march 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>venezuela will supply ecuador with an
as yet undetermined amount of crude oil to help it meet export
commitments, seriously affected by last week's earthquake,
energy and mines minister arturo hernandez grisanti said.
    He gave few details about the deal, but said a crude oil
loan agreement will be made between state oil companies
petroleos de venezuela (pdvsa) and ecuador's cepe.
    Ecuador was forced to suspend oil exports for an expected
four months after an earthquake damaged a pipeline. Oil
accounts for 60 per cent of its export income.
     Hernandez was speaking to reporters at miraflores palace
on the results of talks with ecuador's deputy energy minister
fernando santos alvite, who arrived here last night.
    "the volume lent to ecuador would be discounted from its
opec quota and would not affect venezuela's," he said. "we would
from august on produce our own quota and sell the additional
amounts that ecuador would be repaying us," he said.
    He did not elaborate on the quota arrangements but did say
ecuador would notify opec by telex that venezuela would be
lending it a certain amount over so many days.
    Venezuela's opec output quota is currently 1.495 million
barrels a day, and ecuador's has been set at 210,000 bpd.

<TITLE>BRITAIN CALLS ON JAPAN TO INCREASE IMPORTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>Britain today called on Japan to
increase foreign imports or risk the rise of protectionism and
the harm it would bring to it and other trading nations.
    British Trade and Industry Secretary Paul Channon said
Japan must heed a report issued by a Japanese government
advisory body in December calling for faster domestic demand to
help cut its trade surplus and restructure its economy.
    "I recognise that the strong yen has brought problems to
Japan's domestic economy," he told a group of Japanese
businessmen in London.
    "But these short term difficulties should not be allowed to
deflect Japan from the fundamental reforms necessary," he said.
    "It is not just a domestic issue for Japan. If import
propensity does not expand very soon there is a real risk from
protectionist lobbies, particularly in the U.S. With whom Japan
has so massive a surplus," he said.
    "They may well succeed in securing action by governments
which would be highly injurious to trading nations like Japan
and the U.K."
    Channon said there had been substantial growth in the
volume of trade between Japan and Britain, amounting to 6.2
billion sterling (9.8 billion dlrs) last year.
    But he added: "Regrettably too much of it was in one
direction, with the Japanese selling us 3.7 billion sterling
(5.8 billion dlrs) more than we sold them."

<TITLE>ECUADOR TO ASK OPEC TO RAISE EXPORT QUOTA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CARACAS, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ecuador will ask OPEC to raise its oil
export quota by 100,000 barrels per day to 310,000 to
compensate for lost output due to last week's earthquake,
deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite said.
    Santos Alvite, who arrived in Caracas last night to discuss
an aid plan for Ecuador, did not say when the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would be approached.
    The additional output would be related to plans now under
discussion for Venezuela and Mexico to lend Ecuador crude while
it repairs a pipeline damaged by the quake.
    Earlier, Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister Aturo
Hernandez Grisanti said his country would supply an unspecified
part of Ecuador's export commitments.
    But Santos Alvite told reporters he hoped a first cargo of
300,000 barrels could leave Maracaibo this weekend to supply
refineries near Guayaquil. He added Ecuador also wanted to make
up for 50,000 bpd it shipped to Caribbean destinations. Mexico
might supply Ecuador's South Korean market.
    Ecuador may be unable to export oil for up to five months
due to extensive damage to a 25 mile stretch of pipeline
linking jungle oilfields to the Pacific port of Balao.

<TITLE>CHINA CLOSES SECOND ROUND OF OFFSHORE OIL BIDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>China has closed the second round of
bidding by foreign firms for offshore oil exploration rights,
the China Daily has reported.
    It quoted a spokesman for the China National Offshore Oil
Corp (CNOOC) as saying China signed eight contracts with 15
foreign firms for blocks in the Pearl River mouth and south
Yellow Sea covering a total area of 44,913 sq km.
    Second round bidding began at the end of 1984 and only one
well has so far produced results -- Lufeng 13-1-1, 250 km
south-east of Shenzhen, with an output of 6,770 barrels a day.
The well was drilled by a group of Japanese companies.
    The spokesman added CNOOC was ready to enter into contracts
for offshore blocks before third round bidding began. He did
not say when this would be, but added the contracts would not
be bound by restrictions imposed during the second round.
    China has signed 36 oil contracts and agreements with 37
companies from 10 countries since 1979, when offshore
exploration was open to foreigners. Eleven contracts were
terminated after no oil was discovered.
    Foreign firms have invested 2.1 billion dlrs on offshore
China since 1979.

<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>American Motors Corp &lt;AMO> management
has ordered a hiring freeze in view of Chrysler Corp's &lt;C> 1.5
billion dlr takeover bid, a spokesman for AMC said.
    Analysts said the merger is virtually certain to go ahead.
    American Motors directors met for five hours Wednesday to
review the takeover proposal. "The board ... Expects to be
meeting periodically over the next several weeks on the
Chrysler proposal," AMC said in its first formal statement since
it acknowledged the Chrysler proposal on Monday.
    Chrysler, the number three U.S. Automaker, has said the
merger is motivated principally by its desire to acquire AMC's
profitable Jeep business and dealers, as well as a new modern
car assembly plant in Bramalea, Ontario.
    That means a guaranteed future for much of AMC, but it
leaves in question the fate of many of its 19,000-plus
employees, according to industry analysts. AMC's Toledo, Ohio
Jeep plant has 1,850 hourly workers on indefinite layoff while
its Kenosha, Wisconsin, car plant has another 2,250 on layoff.

<TITLE>FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN AUSTRALIA JUMPS IN LAST QTR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CANBERRA, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>The net inflow of foreign investment
into Australia jumped to 7.3 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter
of 1986 from 4.32 billion in the third quarter and 4.55 billion
a year earlier, the Statistics Bureau said.
    The Bureau attributed the increase to a turnaround of 2.08
billion dlrs in official sector transactions and a 1.09 billion
turnaround in direct investment.
    The turnaround in official transactions to a 1.52 billion
inflow from a 555 mln outflow in the third quarter, against a
520 mln inflow a year earlier, was largely on account of
government foreign currency borrowings, it said.
    Direct investment recorded a turnaround to a 1.04 billion
dlr inflow in the fourth quarter from a 57 mln withdrawal in
the third quarter, against a 546 mln inflow in the fourth
quarter of 1985, the Bureau said.
    It said the major part of the turnaround reflected an
injection of funds, estimated at around 700 mln dlrs,
associated with the previously reported restructuring of the
Australian operations of General Motors Corp &lt;GM>.
    GM used the funds to pay out or take over certain
Australian liabilities of its local unit &lt;General
Motors-Holden's Ltd>, it said.
    However, net borrowings remained the major part of total
inflow, accounting for 6.16 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter
against 3.88 billion in the third quarter and 4.03 billion a
year earlier, the Bureau said.
    Net official borrowings comprised 1.52 billion dlrs against
a net outflow of 548 mln in the third quarter and a 516 mln
inflow a year earlier.
    Total private and semi-public authority net borrowings rose
to 4.64 billion dlrs from 4.42 billion in the third quarter and
3.51 billion a year earlier.

<TITLE>TAIWAN FURTHER RELAXES FOREIGN GOODS IMPORT CURBS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Taiwan said it would soon relax import
controls on some 400 foreign items, including stationery and
books, in a further effort to allow trading partners,
especially the U.S., Greater access to its markets.
    Taiwan announced the easing of import curbs on some 600
farm and industrial products last month, a Council for Economic
Planning and Development spokesman told Reuters.
    He said the new move was intended to balance trade between
Taiwan and its trading partners. The island's trade surplus
reached a record 15.6 billion U.S. Dlrs last year, up from
10.62 billion in 1985.
    In January, Taiwan cut import tariffs on some 1,700 foreign
products and allowed imports of U.S. Wine, beer and cigarettes.
    "We hope the measures will help reduce our trade surplus
this year, especially with that of the U.S.," the spokesman
said.
    Washington is pressing Taiwan to open its markets wider as
a way of cutting its trade deficit with the island, which rose
to 2.35 billion U.S. Dlrs in the first two months of 1987 from
1.87 billion in the year-earlier period.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - MITSUBISHI HEAVY FIGHTS BACK</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Fumiko Fujisaki, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>International efforts to redirect Japan's
export-driven economy toward domestic consumption face heavy
going if the country's largest defence contractor and world's
biggest shipbuilder is anything to go by.
    Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd &lt;MITH.T> (MHI), which began
making ships and iron goods for Japan's military rulers 130
years ago, is responding to the strong yen by redoubling its
efforts to maintain its share of export markets.
    "If we sell the best quality and the cheapest products,
everyone will buy them," MHI president Yotaro Iida said.
    Although two of MHI's main businesses, shipbuilding and
power plant construction, have been hit hard by the yen's 40
pct rise against the dollar, the company has no plans to
abandon them, Iida told Reuters in an interview.
    Its other big activity, aircraft component manufacture, has
performed so well that MHI now accounts for half of the money
Tokyo spends on defence procurement each year.
    "We have made the utmost efforts among the world's
manufacturers to improve productivity," he said. "You may be
surprised if you come to see our plants. The outside is old but
the inside is ultra-modern, with robots and computers."
    Securities analysts at major securities houses agreed that
MHI has pared costs more quickly than its competitors. The
company has slashed its workforce to 47,000 from 86,000 in
1976.
    Despite its cost-cutting, MHI expects profits to drop 40
pct to 30 billion yen in the current fiscal year ending March
31, from 1985/86's record 50.14 billion.
    And that includes gains from the sale of MHI's stake in
Mitsubishi Motors Corp &lt;MIMT.T> for 49 billion yen.
    Iida is optimistic about the future, however. He said a
resurgence of demand from the Middle East following the recent
recovery in oil prices coupled with persistent demand for power
plants in developing countries will help MHI restore its
exports-to-sales ratio to the past decade's average of 30 pct.
    MHI's exports-to-sales ratio fell to 25.9 pct in the
half-year ended last September, from 35 to 36 pct five years
ago.
    China is the most promising market, although MHI also
considers other non-oil-producing developing countries as major
customers.
    "Our customers are all seen as being in trouble due to a
lack of foreign currency," Iida said. But he added that he felt
MHI could sell to those markets with Japanese government
financial support.
    It can also finance the plants itself and recover its
investment through product sales, a strategy Iida said could
prove popular in the future.
    In shipping, MHI is fighting back against low-priced South
Korean competition by building more technologically advanced
carriers to carry liquefied natural gas and other products
difficult to transport.
    Shipbuilders Association officials told Reuters MHI is the
world's largest shipbuilder in terms of orders and capacity.
    Domestically, MHI is involved in 12 national projects,
including development of nuclear fusion reactors and launch
vehicles for man-made satellites.
    It has been the biggest contractor for the Japan Defence
Agency's F-15 and F-14 jet fighters and missiles, although all
of these have been built under licence from U.S. Firms.
    MHI is now heading up five Japanese companies seeking to
develop the country's own fighter plane to replace the
currently used F-1 support fighters in the late 1990s.
    Military experts said Washington is putting strong pressure
on Tokyo to buy a U.S. Plane, either the McDonnell Douglas Corp
F-18 or General Dynamics Corp F-16, to reduce Japan's huge
trade surplus with the U.S.
    "It might be a good idea to jointly produce planes with U.S.
Makers as Japan is supported by the U.S. Defence umbrella," Iida
said.
    MHI also plans to cooperate with the U.S. In its Strategic
Defence Initiative space defence program by participating in
the project when it moves from the research stage, he said.
    The U.S. Has been seeking Japan's technological support.
    In fiscal 1985/86, aircraft accounted for 17.1 pct of MHI's
sales, shipbuilding 17 pct and power plants 27.9 pct. Iida said
the ideal ratio is power plants 30 pct, aircraft and special
vehicles 25 pct and shipbuilding 15 pct.
    As for the remaining 30 pct, Iida said he wanted to shift
the domestic focus away from heavy machinery sold to
manufacturers and towards household goods, but he declined to
specify which products.
    "By the end of this year, you may find our brand name on
your daily products, although this does not mean we will run
away from our mainstream business," he said.

<TITLE>LEIGH-PEMBERTON OPPOSES TAKEOVER PROTECTION RULES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>   LONDON, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England does not favour the
introduction of rules to shield companies from hostile takeover
attempts, its governor, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, said.
    Instead, merchant banks advising bidding companies must
show restraint and responsibility to avoid the excesses that
have marred recent takeovers, he told the Yorkshire and
Humberside Regional Confederation of British Industries' annual
dinner.
    Leigh-Pemberton also called on companies to improve ties
with institutional investors, suggesting representatives of
those institutions be granted seats on the boards of directors
of companies they invest in.
    "Boards cannot expect protection from unwelcome predators,
for that is but a short step from saying that they should be
protected from their own shareholders -- who are, after all,
the proprietors of the company," Leigh-Pemberton said.
    He added takeovers and mergers had an important role to
play in furthering economies of scale, integration and more
efficient market penetration. "The degree of success or failure
(of a takeover) has not in my experience depended on whether or
not the takeover was contested," he said.
    Leigh-Pemberton noted there had been excesses in takeover
activity in the recent past. "The aim is to pressurise a
company's management into action dedicated solely to a
favourable impact on the share price in the short-term, partly
or even primarily at the expense of the future," he said.
    Such bids "often depend for their success on creating a
highly-charged and artificial situation in the share market,
and give rise to temptations, on both sides of the battle, to
engage in aggressive, even manipulative tactics that are
immensely damaging to the interest of the shareholders," he
said.
    In a clear reference recent events, he said "those in the
City who act for companies or individuals .. Must, I suggest,
be ready to accept a full measure of responsibility -- even if
it entails opprobrium -- for the transactions that may result."
    They "should exercise the most careful judgment at the
outset with respect to the clients for whom they act and the
activities contenplated. Those who sow wind cannot expect the
whirlwind to visit elsewhere," he added.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige
has asked the White House to consider blocking the planned
Japanese acquisition of a major U.S. Computer and semiconductor
maker, U.S. Officials said yesterday.
    The officials told reporters Baldrige had serious concerns
on national security grounds about the sale of Schlumberger Ltd
&lt;SLB> unit &lt;Fairchild Semiconductor Inc> to Fujitsu Ltd
&lt;ITSU.T>. The officials said the sale could leave the United
States overly dependent on a foreign company for equipment used
in advanced missiles, aircraft electronics and intelligence
gathering.
    The U.S. Officials added the sale would also worsen the
strained relations between the two countries stemming from the
huge Japanese trade surplus.
    The White House Economic Policy Council would consider the
sale in the coming weeks, they said.
    Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger's position was not
known, but in the past, he has opposed the transfer of high
technology to foreign governments or companies.
    Computers made by U.S. Manufacturers are widely used in the
world, but Tokyo told U.S. Negotiators recently it prefers
local manufacturers and would not buy U.S. Supercomputers.

<TITLE>S.KOREA TO BUY MORE COTTON, ESPECIALLY U.S. COTTON</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SEOUL, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Korea plans to import about 387,000
tonnes of cotton this year compared to 225,000 tonnes in 1986,
trade ministry officials said.
    More than three quarters of the total, some 290,000 tonnes,
will come from the United States. That will be a 93.7 pct
increase on 1986 when U.S. Imports totalled 150,000 tonnes, an
official said.
    He said the U.S. Increase is due partly to the
competitiveness of American cotton and partly to efforts by
Seoul to reduce its trade surplus with Washington. South Korea
is the second largest importer of U.S. Cotton after Japan.

<TITLE>AWB SAYS AUSTRALIAN WHEAT SALES OVER 10 MLN TONNES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MELBOURNE, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Australian Wheat Board's (AWB)
1986/87 export program is well advanced with over 10 mln tonnes
already sold, AWB general manager Ron Paice said.
    "We are certainly within reach of our 15 mln tonne export
target for the year," he said in a statement.
    He did not detail the commitments already made, but an AWB
spokesman said they include sales to Egypt, China, Iran, the
Soviet Union and Iraq.
    In the 1985/86 wheat year ended September 30, the AWB
exported a record 15.96 mln tonnes.
    Paice also said the 1986/87 Australian wheat harvest has
ended after a long, cool summer with 15.14 mln tonnes delivered
to the AWB.
    The season produced another good crop, with only 0.2 pct of
receivals being downgraded to feed quality, he said.
    However, it is likely that some weather-damaged grain was
still being held on farms and further milling and feed wheat
may be delivered following the recent announcement of the final
Guaranteed Minimum Price for 1986/87, he said.
    Paice did not give a crop estimate, but the AWB's February
Wheat Australia publication put the crop at 16.7 mln tonnes.
    But the AWB spokesman said it is likely this estimate could
turn out to be too high, based on the receivals level, and the
final crop figure would probably be nearer to 16.2 mln tonnes.
The official estimate is not yet available.
    In the 1985/86 season, the AWB received 15.08 mln tonnes of
the 16.13 mln tonne crop.
    Another 422,000 tonnes was retained on-farm and 620,000
sold under the permit system introduced in 1984/85 to allow
farmers to sell feed wheat to the grain trade outside the AWB's
receival system, according to Bureau of Agricultural Economics
data.

&lt;NBHA.ME> (NBH) said it will offer one &lt;Norgold Ltd> share for
every five NBH shares in the float of its newly created gold
offshoot.
    The 20 cent par-value shares will be offered at 22 cents to
shareholders registered April 3, NBH said in a statement.
    Norgold's issued capital will be 240.5 mln shares, of which
63 pct will be held by NBH after 89 mln are issued to
shareholders to raise 19.6 mln dlrs, it said.
    Norgold will take control of a portfolio of precious metal
exploration and pre-development interests held by NBH.
    The major gold deposit to be acquired by Norgold is 100 pct
of the Bottle Creek deposit, west of Leonora in Western
Australia, NBH said.
    Production of gold from the project, at an annual rate of
35,000 ounces, is scheduled to begin early in 1988.
    Norgold will also have a 10 pct stake in the Coronation
Hill gold/platinum project in the Northern Territory and 43 pct
of the Poona copper/gold project in South Australia.
    Other gold exploration interests to be acquired by Norgold
are in Western Australia, Queensland, New South Wales and
Tasmania, NBH said.

<TITLE>CONVERTIBLE YEN BOND BROKERAGE FEE MAY BE CUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Tokyo Stock Exchange said in a
statement it is considering reducing brokerage fees on yen
convertible bonds.
    The cut would be in response to a planned increase in
securities transaction tax to 26 yen per 10,000 yen from 4.5 as
part of the government's proposed tax reform bills, securities
house managers said.
    Under the current system, investors must also pay 0.6 pct
of face value as brokerage fee to securities houses for
transactions involving principal over 30 mln yen.
    The exchange's draft revision sets brokerage fee percentage
rates in inverse proportion to the size of amounts transacted,
market sources said.
    Details of rates on transactions under 30 mln yen have yet
to be worked out, an exchange spokesman said.
    The news had little immediate impact on the convertible
bond market because participants are unsure when the new rates
will be introduced and because the timing of parliamentary
approval of the tax reform bills is uncertain due to opposition
to them, securities dealers said.

<TITLE>STRIKING BRAZIL SEAMEN THREATEN MASS RESIGNATION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Stephen Powell, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SANTOS, Brazil, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Striking seamen said they would
offer their collective resignation rather than end their
13-day-old national strike on management's terms.
    The seamen said they were spurred to their decision after
marines occupied the ship Docemarte in Santos harbour Tuesday
night. They said seamen on the vessel were being forced to work
under duress.
    President Jose Sarney's government despatched troops to
Brazil's ports and oil installations on Tuesday.
    Seamen in Santos, Brazil's main port, are in defiant mood.
One of their leaders, Orlando dos Santos, told Reuters that
most of the 1,100 seamen in the port offered their resignations
on Wednesday. The national strike headquarters in Rio de
Janeiro said seamen were offering to resign in all the
country's main ports.
    The strike by 40,000 seamen comes as Brazil faces a serious
debt crisis brought on by a sharp deterioration in its trade
balance. The country needs all the foreign exchange it can get,
and shipowners have been quick to denounce seamen for the harm
the strike is doing to exports.
    An advertisement placed in the newspapers by the Shipowners
Association read, "The seamen's strike is illegal, irrational
and unpatriotic."
    The seamen respond that they cannot live on their present
salaries. According to officical pay lists available in the
union's office, the basic pay for ordinary seamen is 1,977
cruzados a month, while various allowances can bring their
total pay up to 4,000 cruzados a month.
    At the other end of the scale, captains earn 7,993 cruzados
a month basic pay, which is brought up to 15,229 cruzados with
allowances. 
    "Brazil's seamen are the second worst paid in the world,
after Ghana's," dos Santos said. He said the seamen had not
received a pay increase since February 1986, and prices have
doubled since then with the collapse of the government's
Cruzado Plan price freeze.
    Talks in Rio de Janeiro Wednesday involving Labour Minister
Almir Pazzionotto, seamen and employers failed to resolve the
dispute. The seamen are demanding pay raises of about 200 pct
but have been offered less than half that.

<TITLE>INDONESIAN COFFEE PRODUCTION MAY FALL THIS YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesia's coffee production in
1986/87 ending September 30 may fall slightly from last year's
level of 360,000 tonnes, Dharyono Kertosastro, chairman of the
Association of Indonesian Coffee Exporters told Reuters.
    He said shade trees had been damaged by pests and this may
have affected the crop, though it remains to be seen how
seriously. Indonesia's main crop is harvested next month.
    He gave no figure for expected output, except to say it
would probably be down a little from 1985/86. He said stocks
were about normal at 90,000 tonnes.
    Kertosastro predicted that exports were unlikely to rise
much from last year's level of 320,000 tonnes. "I expect exports
will be a bit more, maybe 330,000 tonnes, but not above that,"
he said. Exports in 1985/86 were valued at 944 mln U.S. Dlrs,
but the value could fall by 30 pct this year because of low
prices, he added.
    Dharyono said production was behind a five year plan target
of 420,000 tonnes for the current year, but Indonesia is trying
to boost output through introduction of higher yielding seeds,
better training for farmers and increased use of fertilizers.

<TITLE>RENOUF SELLS 10.83 PCT NZI STAKE TO BRIERLEY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Renouf Corp Ltd> said it sold its
10.83 pct stake in &lt;NZI Corp Ltd> to &lt;Brierley Investments
Ltd>, (BIL), for 207.7 mln N.Z. Dlrs.
    Renouf managing director Mike Cashin said in a statement it
had been Renouf's intention to build up a long-term strategic
position in NZI. "But it became clear to us that it was in the
best interests of both NZI and ourselves for Brierley
Investments to acquire our holding," he said.
    He said Renouf built up its NZI holding over the past six
months. The sale comprised 74.9 mln shares at 2.725 N.Z. Dlrs a
share and 2,095 warrants at 1,709 dlrs each.
    The warrants are attached to a 150 mln Swiss franc note
issue. Each bond of 5,000 francs carries a detachable warrant
entitling the bearer to 2,486 NZI shares.
    In its 1986 annual report BIL reported that it held a 19
pct stake in NZI.
    NZI has 673.4 mln ordinary shares on issue. Total capital
including shares attached to warrants is 678.8 mln shares.
    Cashin said the sale will result in a significant profit
and places Renouf in a good position to consolidate on recent
transactions and pursue other opportunities.
    NZI shares were at 2.18 N.Z. Dlrs, BIL at 4.08 and Renouf
at 6.15 at the close of trading.
    BIL executives were unavailable for comment.

<TITLE>SAUDI BANKS FACE FURTHER LEAN PERIOD</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Stephen Jukes, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    RIYADH, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Saudi Arabia's 11 commercial banks are
reporting a further decline in profits for 1986 as increasing
provisions have to be set aside to cover the burden of non-
performing loans.
    Bankers in the Saudi capital said the need to build
reserves for bad and doubtful debts may start to decline a
little this year.
    But the kingdom's still sluggish economy and legal problems
hampering traditional lending operations mean earnings will
remain vulnerable.
    One senior bank credit officer said "The work is largely
done in terms of identifying bad loans and making provisions,
but banks are still going to face difficulties earning money."
    The sudden decline of Saudi Arabia's corporate sector in
1983 - culminating in a number of debt reschedulings - has
taken a heavy toll of bank profits, with first results now
appearing for 1986 showing a fourth successive year of broad
decline.
    The cumulative net 1985 earnings of the kingdom's banks had
sunk to 827.9 mln riyals from 2.66 billion in 1982 before world
oil prices tumbled.
    Of the kingdom's nine joint-venture banks which operate on
the Gregorian calendar year, four have already reported and
revealed a further profits decline - or net loss - for 1986 at
the expense of increased provisions.
    The newest and smallest of the joint ventures, &lt;United Saudi
Commercial Bank> (USCB) reported a 1986 net loss of 15.9 mln
riyals, marginally less than 1985's shortfall of 17.0 mln.
    Profits before provisions were sharply higher, in part
reflecting an 18 pct staff cut last year. But the bank nearly
trebled the amount set aside against bad and doubtful loans to
60 mln riyals from 22 mln in 1985.
    Other results released so far show &lt;Saudi American Bank>
(SAMBA) reporting a 53.8 pct fall in 1986 net profit to 80.7
mln riyals, while &lt;Al Bank Al Saudi Al Fransi>, known as Saudi
French, slid 14 pct to 94.9 mln riyals.
    Both Saudi American, owned 40 pct by Citicorp's &lt;CCI.N>
Citibank NA and Saudi French, 40 pct owned by Banque Indosuez,
increased provisions sharply.
    &lt;Arab National Bank>'s net profit fell 17.8 pct to 152.1
mln riyals and provisions were more than doubled to 86.6 mln
riyals.
    Bankers said there are first signs that the number of non-
performing loans has stopped growing as the decline in the
Saudi economy bottoms out.
    Few are willing to predict a sharp upturn in economic
activity, but one banker said "The top 50 pct of the Saudi banks
are now at or close to international levels on provisions."
    From 1982 to 1985, the kingdom's largest bank &lt;National
Commercial Bank> (NCB) stashed away 1.7 billion riyals in
provisions or 8.9 pct of its total loans and advances to the
private sector, bankers calculated.
    Between 1982 and 1985, &lt;Riyad Bank>, NCB's rival as the
second biggest of the two all-Saudi shareholding banks, had
covered 12.8 pct of its loans and advances. Both banks operate
on an Islamic year that does not coincide with the other nine.
    Although the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) has been
tightening supervision, there is still no standardised rule for
declaring loans as non-performing.
    Bankers say this makes comparison of profit figures
difficult because some banks still book non-accruing interest
as revenue while others follow more conservative practices in
force in major world financial centres.
    Bankers generally said NCB, Riyad Bank and the
joint-ventures SAMBA, Saudi French and Arab National Bank rank
as the strongest earners.
    Other banks such as &lt;Saudi British Bank>, 40 pct owned by
the &lt;British Bank of the Middle East>, are disadvantaged by a
relatively low deposit base.
    Saudi British slashed 1985 profit 91 pct to just 9.1 mln
riyals and 1986 accounts due soon are expected to show another
low figure. But the bank has traditionally been one of the most
conservative in making provisions.
    Bankers said SAMA has proved it is not prepared to see a
Saudi bank go under and not only supported &lt;Saudi Cairo Bank>
after its troubled 1985 accounts came to light but also made
available cheap deposits to &lt;Saudi Investment Bank> and USCB.
    The banks can on-lend these to generate profit, but
generally banks are awash with liquidity since they are
unwilling to risk incurring fresh non-performing loans.
    And while banks in more liberal financial markets can
attempt to diversify away from traditional lending,
conservatism in Saudi banking has made it difficult to generate
fee income from new investment banking products.
    One banker said "Operating earnings in the Kingdom are not
good."
    Reflecting the caution in new lending, the amount of
advances is showing a declining trend, while the days when
banks had ample funds in interest-free current accounts to
invest are disappearing as Saudi customers seek a better return
on their money.
    In 1979, the ratio of interest-bearing accounts to current
accounts was 27 to 73 pct. Today, only about 40 pct of customer
funds are held on current account.

    Guinness says its former chairman Ernest Saunders and Ward
"breached their fiduciary duty" in authorising the payment to
Ward, via a Jersey-based company, Marketing and Acquisitions
Consultants and has gone to the Jersey court to recover it.
    MAC said in defence documents that Ward was the main
negotiator in the battle for Distillers against rival bidder
Argyll &lt;AYLL.L> Group Plc.
    "The bid would not have been successful but for the ...
Services of Mr Ward," MAC attorneys said in the documents
submitted in court. "The payment was, in all the circumstances,
reasonable, proper and fully earned."

<TITLE>INDONESIA PRESSING FOR COMPROMISE OVER COFFEE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jeremy Clift, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesian coffee exporters are
preparing for a period of depressed prices while urging their
government to lobby for a resolution of the deadlocked issue of
export quotas, the chairman of the Association of Indonesian
Coffee Exporters (AICE) told Reuters.
    Dharyono Kertosastro said in an interview that Indonesia,
the world's third largest producer, is trimming costs and
improving its marketing while seeking a compromise on quotas.
    "But as long as Brazil sticks to its hardline position, we
can never bridge the gap," Dharyono said.
    Indonesia was one of a group of eight producing countries,
along with Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador,
Honduras, India, Papua New Guinea and Peru, which proposed a
new quota system at last month's failed International Coffee
Organistion (ICO) talks in London.
    Brazil, which would have had its quota reduced under the
Group of Eight scheme, blocked the proposal.
    AICE officials are now hoping Colombia can use its contacts
with Brazil to suggest a compromise.
    Edward Muda, an AICE official who attended the ICO
negotiations, said Latin American members of the Group of Eight
were in contact with Colombia, the world's second largest
producer, but gave no details.
    "Colombia has shown interest because they will gain from a
compromise. Without one, they will suffer if the present market
stays like it is," Muda said.
    He said Indonesia was in contact with consumers such as the
U.S., Japan, the Netherlands, West Germany and Canada ahead of
an ICO executive board meeting scheduled for April 1.
    Dharyono said the AICE will send delegations to the U.S.
And Japan to brief Indonesian embassy officials there and press
them to present Indonesia's case more firmly.
    He urged the Indonesian government to do more to help the
country's coffee traders through the ICO negotiations.
    Muda said the Group of Eight had some common ground with
the big consumers because they agreed on the need for basing
quotas on what he termed "realistic criteria."
    The breakaway group believes the old quota system, which
gives Brazil a 30 pct share of the quota exports, does not
reflect up-to-date supply and demand trends.
    Brazil has stuck rigidly to its insistence that the old
system be applied.
    Export quotas were suspended in February 1986 when market
prices surged because of the failure of the Brazilian crop.
    Although prices have long since come down to a point where
export controls could be reintroduced, producers and consumers
at the 75-member ICO have not been able to agree on new
guidelines. Brazil and the U.S., The largest consumer, are both
refusing to alter their positions.
    Dharyono said if new quotas are not agreed he believed
Indonesia was well placed to survive low prices.
    Indonesian farmers are trimming production costs and the
AICE is improving its marketing system, Dharyono said.
    Indonesia's coffee output in 1986/87, ending September 30,
is expected to stagnate or fall slightly from last year's level
of 360,000 tonnes, he said.
    He said stocks, at 90,000 tonnes, were about average for
the time of year.

<TITLE>JAPANESE CORPORATE EARNINGS RECOVERY PREDICTED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese corporate earnings will rise 8.9
pct in fiscal 1987/88 for the first year-on-year increase in
three years, partly because of the yen's stable exchange rate,
the Nomura research institute said.
    Sales of all industries are predicted to rise 1.9 pct in
the year, which starts April 1, the research arm of Nomura
Securities Co said in a statement.
    Recurrent profits were estimated to fall 20 pct in the
current fiscal year with sales forecast to drop 14 pct.
    The forecast assumes an average rate of 148.5 yen to the
dollar in 1987/88, compared with 160 yen in the current year.
    Corporate efforts to cope with the yen's appreciation, such
as cutting production costs, are expected to bear fruit next
fiscal year, the institute said. The economy should also
benefit from pump-priming expected from the government and a
halt in rising prices of manufactured goods, it said.
    Recurrent profits of manufacturing industries are projected
to rise 29.6 pct next fiscal year against an estimated 40.1 pct
fall in the current year.
    Non-manufacturing sector profits will decline 4.5 pct in
1987/88 against an estimated 2.2 pct rise in the current year,
it said.

<TITLE>BOLIDEN SAYS RESULTS BURDENED BY LOSS WRITEOFF</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     STOCKHOLM, Mar 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Swedish mining and metals group
Boliden AB &lt;BLDS ST> forecast a return to profitability during
1987 after recording a 1.08 billion crown 1986 loss burdened by
a massive write-off.
    The company, which consolidated the Swedish wholesale and
investment conglomerate &lt;Ahlsell AB> this year, said the result
included restructuring costs and write-offs of 802 mln crowns.
    "These costs have arisen as a results of a change of
direction for the group. They are mainly one-off but they have
burdened the annual accounts," the company said in a statement.
    Boliden said the company's liquid assets were 1.36 billion
crowns at year-end which together with an investment portfolio
of 1.60 billion made it one of the most liquid Swedish
companies.
    As a result of the 1986 losses, the board proposed
cancelling dividend for the year although it predicted a return
to profitability during 1987, the statement added.
    Swedish tyres, process equipment and components firm
&lt;Trelleborg AB> has taken a majority stake in Boliden since the
beginning of this year. Trelleborg then said it had no plans
for consolidating Boliden.

<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>The French 1986 current account balance
of payments surplus has been revised slightly upwards to 25.8
billion francs from the 25.4 billion franc figure announced
last month, the Finance Ministry said.
    This compares with a 1.5 billion deficit in 1985, and while
it is the first surplus since 1979, is substantially lower than
the 50 billion surplus forecast by the previous socialist
government before they lost office in March last year.
    Net long-term capital outflows rose sharply to 70.5 billion
francs last year from 8.8 billion in 1985, largely due to a
major program of foreign debt repayment, the ministry said.
    In the fourth quarter alone the unadjusted surplus rose to
14.1 billion francs from 6.6 billion the previous quarter, but
the adjusted surplus fell to 7.4 billion from 9.1 billion.
    Fourth quarter medium and long-term foreign debt repayments
exceeded new credits by 11 billion francs.

<TITLE>ROWNTREE REPORTS PRETAX PROFIT AT 84 MLN STG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Rowntree Mackintosh Plc &lt;RWNT.L>
announced it made a pretax profit of 84 mln stg in the 53 weeks
ending January 3, 1987, compared with 79.3 mln stg in the
previous year.
    Turnover was up to 1.29 billion stg from 1.2 billion. A
final dividend of 9.2p was proposed, after a final 8.2p last
year. Earnings per share rose to 35p from 34.8p.
    The results were broadly in line with market expectations,
leaving shares at 499p in early trading, up one pence from
yesterday's close, but slightly off pre-announcement opening
levels.
    Profit on ordinary activities after tax was 66.2 mln stg,
up from the previous year's 60.7 mln.
    The U.K. Remained Rowntree's largest centre for trading
profits, accounting for 47.9 mln stg, up from 45.3 mln in 1985.
Profit from its second largest geographical area, North
America, slipped to 34.7 mln stg from 37.2 mln. North American
profits were affected by the fall of the value of the dollar.
    Operations in continental Europe made 7.8 mln stg in
trading profit, up from 3.4 mln, with 4.0 mln stg made in
Australasia, up from 2.3 mln, and 11.3 mln stg from the rest of
the world, against 13.1 mln in the previous year.
    Extraordinary items amounted to a 11.3 mln debit after a
16.5 mln debit previously. A company spokesman said this
represented additional provisions for the cost of
rationalisation plans announced in earlier years.
    Rowntree expects North American operations will this year,
ahead of company expectations, be of the same order as those
from the U.K. And the rest of Europe combined, the statement
said. A spokesman said no specific figures had been forecast.
    Acquisitions will continue to be sought worldwide,
including further moves in the speciality retailing business
which Rowntree first entered in 1983, the statement said.
    Rising profit from Europe this year was forecast by
chairman Kenneth Dixon in a statement. He added the performance
of seven businesses bought last year was encouraging.
    The U.K. Confectionery side gained market share and
increased trading margins. The Sun-Pat British grocery concern
increased profit and Rowntree's small health food business,
Holgates, raised earnings 10-fold, the statement said.
    Offsetting factors included currency movements, which cost
the company nearly 5.0 mln stg. Sales tax hurt Canadian profits
on confectionery operations, and the company faced strong
competition in the U.K. Snack and Mid East export markets.

<TITLE>BANK OF ENGLAND OFFERS EARLY HELP IN MONEY MARKET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England said it had invited
the discount houses to make an early round of bill offers to
help offset a large liquidity shortage in the money market.
    It estimated the shortage at around 1.55 billion stg, one
adverse factor being the unwinding of a sale and repurchase
agreement, with the market having to buy back bills worth 542
mln stg from the Bank.
    Bills maturing in official hands and the treasury bill
take-up would drain 957 mln stg wile exchequer transactions and
a note circulation rise would take out 15 mln and 25 mln
respectively. Above target bankers' balances would add 10 mln.

<TITLE>TAIWAN CLAMPS NEW CONTROLS ON CURRENCY INFLOWS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Andrew Browne, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Taiwan's new controls on currency
inflows, implemented today, are a desperate bid to stem a flood
of speculative money prompted by the local currency surge
against the U.S. Dollar, local and foreign bankers said.
    The central bank now has to clear remittances exceeding one
mln U.S. Dlrs earned from exports, shipping and insurance and
bank lending plus remittances of more than 10,000 dlrs from any
other source.
    Petitioners have to show their remittances relate to
genuine commercial transactions.
    Meanwhile, traders are no longer required to report all
outward payments concerning invisible trade, including freight,
insurance and royalties, to the central bank.
    But bankers said they believed the new controls would be
ineffective since businessmen could split up remittances into
smaller units or simply remit money through Taiwan's
flourishing currency black market.
    The bankers said the controls, announced on March 6, are a
panic reaction to U.S. Pressure, which has intensified over the
past week, for a faster appreciation of the Taiwan dollar to
slow the growth of Taiwan's exports to the U.S.
    The government has denied local press reports Washington is
pressing for an exchange rate of up to 28 dlrs.
    The Taiwan dollar opened four cents up today at 34.70.
    "I don't think the central bank has a final target," said an
executive with a U.S. Bank. Other bankers and economists said
they are wary of making any firm predictions about how far the
Taiwan dollar will rise.
    Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. Hit 13.6 billion U.S.
Dlrs last year against 10.2 billion in 1985. The surplus
widened in the first two months of the year to 2.35 billion
dlrs from 1.87 billion in the same period last year.
    Economists estimate up to five billion dlrs in speculative
money flowed into Taiwan in 1986.
    This inflow helped boost foreign exchange reserves to more
than 51 billion dlrs from just under 25 billion this time last
year and provided further upward pressure on the currency.
    The Taiwan dollar has appreciated by almost 15 pct against
the U.S. Currency since September 1985, further encouraging
speculators.
    Central bank governor Chang Chi-cheng said last week
Washington's pressure plus rising foreign exchange reserves
meant a further strengthening in the currency is inevitable.
    Many local bankers argue the only effective solution to the
currency problem is to drop foreign exchange controls and allow
the local dollar to find its own level.
    "Lifting exchange controls is the final answer, but the
central bank is not prepared to do it. It simply does not want
to take the risk," said one local banker.
    He said he believed the new restrictions are a temporary
measure designed to buy time as the central bank grapples with
the exchange rate problem.
    The restrictions are a bureaucratic imposition and skirt
around the real issue, he said.
    Taiwan needs a fundamental restructuring of foreign
exchange controls, said an executive with a western bank.
    "The controls will create more paperwork, but the extra bank
charges will not outweigh the profits of speculation," said the
manager of a European bank.
    Economists criticised the controls, saying they could
antagonise Washington, which is pushing for further economic
liberalisation in Taiwan.
    "Instead of liberalising outflows, the government has
restricted inflows," said Kate Newman, an economist with Vickers
da Costa.
    A local banker, who declined to be named, said, "It's
basically ridiculous. It's a backward movement and goes against
the government's liberalisation programme."
    Taiwan last year eased some of its financial regulations to
enable Taiwan nationals to invest in foreign government bonds,
treasury bills and certificates of deposit and to allow
individuals to take 5,000 U.S. Dlrs in cash out of the country
each year.

<DATELINE>    ROTTERDAM, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dutch sugar traders deny involvement
in a plan to offer more than 850,000 tonnes of sugar to
intervention in protest at EC export policy and prices, traders
told Reuters.
    Although some 2,500 tonnes of sugar have been offered to
intervention in the Netherlands, Dutch producers and traders
said this sugar was actually Belgian and was being offered by
the Belgian industry.
    "We sympathise with the actions of the French, West German
and Belgian traders and producers, but we are not party to it,"
a spokesman said.
    EC Commission sources said yesterday French traders planned
to sell 775,000 tonnes into intervention stocks, West German
traders 75,000 tonnes and Dutch traders 2,500. Dutch trade
sources gave the same figure for France, but estimated up to
110,000 tonnes offered by German traders and producers.
    The Dutch spokesman added, "The weekly export tender policy
and prices are squeezing the European sugar industry, and this
is the only way in which they can really register their
protest.
    "These are desperate actions, but we believe that most of
this offered sugar will be withdrawn within the three-week
breathing space allowed."

<TITLE>BRITISH TELECOM SEES SATISFACTORY 1986/87 RESULTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>British Telecommunications Plc &lt;BTY.L>
expects to announce satisfactory results for its 1986/87
financial year ending March, chairman Sir George Jefferson said
in a third quarter statement.
    Full year results will be published in June. In the 1985/86
financial year, pre-tax profit rose to 1.81 billion stg from
1.48 billion in the previous period.
    Jefferson said good progress was made in the latest nine
months, while most customers were able to maintain their normal
level of calls during the recent strike by company engineers.
    The statement said a positive cash flow of 381 mln stg for
the first nine months will diminish in the final quarter due to
corporation tax and dividend payments.
    Earlier, the company reported third quarter pre-tax profit
for the period ended December 31 of 506 mln stg compared with
452 mln a year earlier. Nine month pre-tax was 1.51 billion stg
against 1.35 billion.
    British Telecom shares were last quoted at 246-1/2p, level
with late yesterday, in the wake of results which were in line
with market expectations, dealers said.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIA EXPECTS RISE IN MEAT EXPORTS TO MIDEAST</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Ian MacKenzie, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Australia expects meat and livestock
exports to the Middle East to maintain an upward trend this
year, managing director of the Australian Meat and Livestock
Corp, Peter Frawley, said.
    He told Reuters an improvement in the economic climate and
less competition from the European Community should lead in the
Gulf area to higher beef sales, which dropped from 33,000
tonnes in 1980 to just 2,300 tonnes last year.
    "In the last three to four months there has been a
resurgence of inquiries," he said.
    Frawley is on a Gulf tour which will also take him to Saudi
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait to assess market
potential.
    On beef exports, he said a 50 pct drop in European
Community intervention stock in the past 12 months would help
Australian sales.
    The fall meant the EC was not as aggressive in these
markets, where the Australian trade was the natural source of
supply, and Australia was "now back in," Frawley said.
    He said there was a debate in Australia as to whether the
Middle East market for livestock, which accounts for two-thirds
of meat export value to the area, would be maintained.
    He believed the trade would remain with a continuing demand
for fresh meat.
    The number of live sheep shipped last year to Saudi Arabia,
the biggest single market, was 3,214,159 compared with
2,939,226 in 1985. The numbers shipped to the United Arab
Emirates and Bahrain fell, however.
    Frawley said the slackening in demand in the Gulf had been
offset by other Arab countries around the Mediterranean.
    Other than livestock, Australia's overall meat sales to the
Middle East rose to 72,374 tonnes in 1986 from 52,403 tonnes
the previous year, largely due to the sale of 25,790 tonnes of
mutton and lamb to Iran.
    Australia sold 9,824 tonnes to Iran in 1985 after being
virtually excluded by New Zealand competition for several
years. Frawley said the 1986 sale contract had included a
barter provision, but Iran had paid in full in cash.
    Negotiations with the Iranians for 1987 shipments were
currently under way, with Iran again seeking credit and barter
provisions, he said.
    Frawley said there had been a tremendous growth in demand
for chilled lamb in the last four to five years and he
predicted this would continue.
    "The Middle East, and the Gulf in particular, is now
Australia's largest market for lamb, chilled and flown in.
Australia is in an ideal position to provide the supplies if
the market is willing to pay a premium for a fresh, young
product," he said.

<TITLE>INDIA 1986/87 COTTON EXPORT QUOTA UP 190,000 BALES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW DELHI, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>India's raw cotton export quota has
been raised by 190,000 170-kg bales to 600,000 bales in 1986/87
ending August, still well below the 1985/86 quota of 1.35 mln
bales, Minister of State for Textiles R.N. Mirdha said.
    State and private agencies contracted to export 1.34 mln
bales in 1985/86, he told journalists. But only 433,000 bales
were shipped that year, with the rest to be delivered in
1986/87. About 758,000 bales from 1985/86 contracts were
shipped up to February 2 in 1986/87.
     The government will export 600,000 bales of long and
extra- long staple cotton in the three years from 1986/87, he
said.

<TITLE>LYONNAISE DES EAUX FORECASTS 1987 PROFIT RISE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Consolidated attributable net profit of
Ste Lyonnaise des Eaux &lt;LYOE.PA> is likely to rise by at least
10 pct this year from the 360 mln francs reported for 1986,
Chairman Jerome Monod told a news conference.
    Group turnover should rise about seven pct from the 15.7
mln reported for this year, while group investments should
total around 1.8 billion francs, somewhat above the 1.3 billion
annual average of the past three years, he added.
    Investments will be aimed mainly at developing the group's
leisure industry, health and communications activities, Monod
said.
    In the leisure sector the group planned a joint development
with Club Mediterranee &lt;CMI.PA>, Club Med, of a 200 hectare
pleasure park at Puisaye in the Yonne department of Eastern
Central France, he said.
    Wholly-owned subsidiary Lyonnaise de Developpement
Touristique would carry out the construction work and financial
planning of the development which would be leased to Club Med
as operator of the complex, he said.
    He gave no financial details but said leisure sector
investments would total about 100 mln francs over the next
three years.
    Investments in the communications industry would go mainly
to develop the group's cable television activities and its 25
pct owned Metropole Television affiliate. Metropole recently
won the concession to operate a sixth television channel in
France.
    Financing requirement of Metropole would be about 700 mln
francs over the next four years, of which Lyonaise des Eaux
would provide about 175 mln, Monod said.
    Monod said Metropole aimed to win a 15 to 20 pct audience
share and to capture about 10 pct of the national television
advertising market.
    Total investment by the group in the communications sector,
including cable activities, would be between 300 mln and 400
mln francs over the next five years, mainly concentrated in the
coming year.
    Investment in cable operations would total between 150 mln
and 200 mln over the five years, with the aim of widening the
audience to 280,000 subscribers from 12,000, and boosting
turnover to around 450 mln francs a year from 10 mln.

<TITLE>GERMAN PUBLIC AUTHORITY BUNDESBANK HOLDINGS FALL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>The net position of federal states
worsened in the first March week, cutting public authority net
holdings at the Bundesbank by 500 mln marks, the central bank
said.
    States' cash deposits at the central bank fell to 800 mln
and they also drew down 1.2 billion marks in book credit, 900
mln marks more than in the prior week.
    By contrast, however, the federal government was able to
reduce its credit drawdown at the central bank by 900 mln marks
to 900 mln.
    Despite the stronger states' net needs in the week, their
cash position and other market dependent influences just about
balanced the outflow of liquidity from the money market through
an increase in cash in circulation, the Bundesbank said.
    Cash in circulation rose by 1.4 billion marks in the week
to 122.9 billion.
    Liquidity also came in through the maturing of short-term
treasury bills bought from the Bundesbank in the prior week.
    Gross currency reserves rose in the week by 400 mln marks
to 109.9 billion. Foreign liabilities of the Bundesbank were
largely unchanged at 22.8 billion marks, giving a rise in net
currency reserves of 400 mln to 87.0 billion, it said.
    The Bundesbank said its balance sheet total fell by 3.77
billion in the week to 218.45 billion.

<TITLE>HUNGARIAN 1987 SUGAR BEET AREA LITTLE CHANGED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BUDAPEST, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hungary is to grow sugar beet on
105,000 hectares of land this year compared with some 95,000 in
1986, the official MTI news agency said.
    Diplomats said this reflected Hungary's policy of keeping
the sugar beet area stable under the current five-year plan
(1985-89) and producing enough to cover only domestic demand
despite the recent rise of world prices to 10 month highs.
    Drought cut the 1986 harvest to 3.58 mln tonnes from 4.07
mln in 1985. But a record yield of 130 kilos per tonne of beet
kept production at 454,000 tonnes, with 30,000 extra refined in
Yugoslavia from Hungarian beet. Output was 483,000 in 1985.

<TITLE>BULLETIN SAYS TIN PRICE MAY RISE TO 20 RINGGIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KUALA LUMPUR, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>The tin price is likely to rise to
20 ringgit a kilo this year because of the producers' accord on
export quotas and the reluctance of brokers and banks to sell
the metal at lower prices, a Malaysian government bulletin
said.
    The Malaysian Tin bulletin said it is in producers'
interest to keep to their quotas to limit total exports to
90,000 tonnes and to gradually deplete the 80,000 tonnes
overhang.
    It said consumption by industrialised countries should stay
at 160,000 tonnes and that International Tin Council creditors
and brokers are not likely to dump their stocks excessively
unless there is a large and abrupt price jump.
    The continued depreciation of the dollar could also help
push up the price of tin, the bulletin said.
    A depreciation of the dollar means the depreciation of the
ringgit which is closely pegged to it, making the price of tin
cheaper in sterling terms, it added.
    "Even in the absence of economic rationale in the tin
market, psychological optimism alone is sufficient to secure a
price recovery of up to 20 ringgit per kilo," the bulletin said.

Yellow Sea covering a total area of 44,913 sq km.
    Second round bidding began at the end of 1984 and only one
well has so far produced results -- Lufeng 13-1-1, 250 km
south-east of Shenzhen, with an output of 6,770 barrels a day.
The well was drilled by a group of Japanese companies.
    The spokesman added CNOOC was ready to enter into contracts
for offshore blocks before third round bidding began. He did
not say when this would be, but added the contracts would not
be bound by restrictions imposed during the second round.
    China has signed 36 oil contracts and agreements with 37
companies from 10 countries since 1979, when offshore
exploration was open to foreigners. Eleven contracts were
terminated after no oil was discovered.
    Foreign firms have invested 2.1 billion dlrs on offshore
China since 1979.

<TITLE>ECUADOR SEEKS HALT TO PAYMENTS TO BANKS IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    QUITO, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ecuador, stricken by a severe earthquake,
is seeking through negotiations with private foreign banks to
postpone all payments due to them for the rest of the year,
Finance Minister Domingo Cordovez said.
    He said in a statement, "The idea with the foreign banks is
to obtain from them the best terms to give the Ecuadorean
economy a complete relief in the period of deferral of payments
on the foreign debt during the present year."
    The statement referred only to payments due to private
foreign banks, a senior government finance official told
Reuters.
    These creditors hold two-thirds of Ecuador's foreign debt
which totals 8.16 billion dlrs.
    It did not refer to debts maturing to foreign governments
and multilateral lending agencies, accounting for the remainder
of Ecuador's foreign debt, the official said.
    He said Ecuador owed the private foreign banks between 450
and 500 mln dlrs in interest payments for the rest of 1987 and
about 66 mln in principal payments maturing this year.
    Cordovez said Ecuador would seek new loans from
multilateral organisations. A World Bank mission was due here
soon to evaluate emergency loans, government officials said.
    Ecuador has also appealed for emergency aid from about 40
foreign governments.
    Government officials have calculated losses to the 1987
budget from last Thursday's earthquake at 926 mln dlrs.
    In 1986, Ecuador's total service on the foreign debt was
about 996 mln dlrs to all creditors.
    The quake ruptured Ecuador's main oil pipeline, suspending
crude exports for five months until the line is repaired. Oil
accounts for up to two-thirds of its total exports and up to 60
pct of total revenues. Before the tremor, Ecuador suspended
interest payments on January 31 to private foreign banks.
    Officials said they stopped interest payments due to a
cash-flow squeeze stemming from a slide in world oil prices,
which cut 1986 exports by about 25 pct to 2.18 billion dlrs.
    Ecuadorean finance officials have been in telephone contact
every day this week with some of the banks who sit on its
14-bank advisory committee, the senior government finance
official said. The committee represents the country's 400 or so
private foreign bank creditors.
    Cordovez also said in the statement, "The banks should
perceive that it is impossible at this moment to comply with
what was forseen."
    Cordovez added, Ecuador must make a new proposal in line
with the reality since the earthquake by seeking better options
of deferment and of softening the negotiation conditions."
    Interest payments fall due at least monthly to private
foreign banks.
    Ecuador's initial proposal earlier this year was to make
only one semi-annual or one annual interest payment this year.
    Under this proposal, it sought to defer interest payments
until June at the earliest, foreign bankers and government
officials here said.
    Ecuadorean officials held their last formal meeting with
the advisory committee in New York in January, but the
negotiations were suspended on January 16 due to the 12-hour
kidnapping of President Leon Febres Cordero by air force
paratroopers.
    The Red Cross says that least 300 people died and at least
4,000 are missing due to the earthquake.

<TITLE>LEIGH-PEMBERTON OPPOSES TAKEOVER PROTECTION RULES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>   LONDON, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England does not favour the
introduction of rules to shield companies from hostile takeover
attempts, its governor, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, said.
    Instead, merchant banks advising bidding companies must
show restraint and responsibility to avoid the excesses that
have marred recent takeovers, he told the Yorkshire and
Humberside Regional Confederation of British Industries' annual
dinner.
    Leigh-Pemberton also called on companies to improve ties
with institutional investors, suggesting representatives of
those institutions be granted seats on the boards of directors
of companies they invest in.
    "Boards cannot expect protection from unwelcome predators,
for that is but a short step from saying that they should be
protected from their own shareholders -- who are, after all,
the proprietors of the company," Leigh-Pemberton said.
    He added takeovers and mergers had an important role to
play in furthering economies of scale, integration and more
efficient market penetration. "The degree of success or failure
(of a takeover) has not in my experience depended on whether or
not the takeover was contested," he said.
    Leigh-Pemberton noted there had been excesses in takeover
activity in the recent past. "The aim is to pressurise a
company's management into action dedicated solely to a
favourable impact on the share price in the short-term, partly
or even primarily at the expense of the future," he said.
    Such bids "often depend for their success on creating a
highly-charged and artificial situation in the share market,
and give rise to temptations, on both sides of the battle, to
engage in aggressive, even manipulative tactics that are
immensely damaging to the interest of the shareholders," he
said.
    In a clear reference recent events, he said "those in the
City who act for companies or individuals .. Must, I suggest,
be ready to accept a full measure of responsibility -- even if
it entails opprobrium -- for the transactions that may result."
    They "should exercise the most careful judgment at the
outset with respect to the clients for whom they act and the
activities contenplated. Those who sow wind cannot expect the
whirlwind to visit elsewhere," he added.

<TITLE>ECUADOR TO ASK OPEC TO RAISE EXPORT QUOTA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CARACAS, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ecuador will ask OPEC to raise its oil
export quota by 100,000 barrels per day to 310,000 to
compensate for lost output due to last week's earthquake,
deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite said.
    Santos Alvite, who arrived in Caracas last night to discuss
an aid plan for Ecuador, did not say when the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would be approached.
    The additional output would be related to plans now under
discussion for Venezuela and Mexico to lend Ecuador crude while
it repairs a pipeline damaged by the quake.
    Earlier, Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister Aturo
Hernandez Grisanti said his country would supply an unspecified
part of Ecuador's export commitments.
    But Santos Alvite told reporters he hoped a first cargo of
300,000 barrels could leave Maracaibo this weekend to supply
refineries near Guayaquil. He added Ecuador also wanted to make
up for 50,000 bpd it shipped to Caribbean destinations. Mexico
might supply Ecuador's South Korean market.
    Ecuador may be unable to export oil for up to five months
due to extensive damage to a 25 mile stretch of pipeline
linking jungle oilfields to the Pacific port of Balao.

<TITLE>JACOBS SUCHARD EXPECTS ANOTHER EXCELLENT YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Jacobs Suchard AG &lt;JACZ.Z> hopes for
another excellent year in 1987 after a 27 pct increase in 1986
net profit. Results in the first few months show it heading in
the right direction, company president Klaus Jacobs said.
    The group reported 1986 net profit of 190.9 mln Swiss
francs compared with 150.4 mln in 1985 and raised its dividend
per bearer share to 160 francs from 155 francs.
    Jacobs said the increase in profit, which far exceeded the
company's target of five pct real annual growth, had been made
possible by restructuring measures introduced in January 1986
which had also made some major acquisitions possible last year.
    Hermann Pohl, general director in charge of economic
affairs, said the 2.7 pct decline in group turnover to 5.24
billion francs was due to currency factors.
    A 5.2 pct negative currency influence was partially offset
by growth in operations and by structural changes within the
group.
    Turnover in the coffee business fell to 3.10 billion francs
from 3.56 billion in 1985 while turnover in the chocolate
sector rose to 2.14 billion francs from 1.82 billion. The
tonnage sold in both sectors declined due to higher prices and
lower consumer demand, especially in France and West Germany.
    Jacobs Suchard increased its market share in West Germany
to 44.9 pct from 39.9 pct in 1985, largely as a result of
acquisitions. Market share in France was little changed at 25
pct against 25.3 pct.
    Pohl said the group's average tax rate rose to 32.5 pct
from 28.8 pct because of the higher profits and despite
write-offs on the losses of new acquisitions. A further
increase in tax levels was expected in future.
    Taxes jumped 51.3 pct to 92 mln francs in 1986 from 61 mln
the previous year.

<TITLE>JAPAN FIRM PLANS TO SELL U.S. FARMLAND TO JAPANESE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MORIOKA, Japan, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>A Japanese real estate company
said it will launch a campaign to sell land in U.S. Farming
areas to rich Japanese.
    Higashi Nippon House said it would offer around 2,200 acres
of land in Illinois, California, Florida and Indiana from early
April to gauge response. It set up International Farm Corp of
America in Chicago last September to oversee the operation.
    American farmers would continue as working tenants and part
of the profits from harvests of rice, corn, soybean and oranges
would go to the Japanese investors as rental.
    Japanese Agriculture Ministry officials told Reuters sales
were limited to farmers to keep land in agricultural use.
    "Two years ago, I began to seek my own farmland in Japan,"
said Isao Nakamura, president of Higashi Nippon. "However, sale
of Japanese farmland is strictly controlled by the government,
so I began to look for the land in the U.S to make my dream to
own farm land come true."
    Nakamura said hundreds of companies exist in the U.S. To
sell farmland to investors as more and more farmers face
difficulties due to the recession in U.S. Agriculture.

<TITLE>DRESDNER BANK UNIT SAYS NOT WORRIED ON BRAZIL DEBT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HAMBURG, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Deutsch-Suedamerikanische Bank AG, a
wholly owned subsidiary of Dresdner Bank AG &lt;DRSD.F>, said it
was not worried about Brazil stopping its interest payments.
    Board member Herbert Mittendorf told a news conference that
Brazil's example was unlikely to be followed by other Latin
American countries.
    He pointed out that the region's debt rose by only 2.8 pct
last year to a total 396 billion dlrs. The countries' efforts
to further economic growth and to consolidate budgets were "not
unsuccessful." But the slump in oil prices and the decline in
commodity prices hampered these efforts, he said.
    Latin American countries' exports fell last year by about
16 pct to 80 billion dlrs, with imports declining slightly to
around 65 billion dlrs, Mittendorf said.
    The region's 1986 trade surplus was halved to an estimated
15 billion dlrs, he said. The cut in exchange earnings of oil
exporting countries was only partly offset by the advantages
gained by the region's oil importing states, he noted.
    The region's principal debtors are Brazil and Mexico, each
owing about 100 billion dlrs at the end of last year, followed
by Argentina with around 49 billion dlrs, Venezuela with 33
billion and Chile with 20 billion dlrs debt.
    Deutsch-Suedamerikanische Bank welcomed Mexico joining the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in mid 1986,
which it saw as an effort to integrate the country to a larger
extent into the world economy.
    However, realistic exchange rates were needed if the debtor
countries were to compete in the world market, Mittendorf said.
    In this respect an easing of protectionist barriers was
imperative, he said.
    The conversion of debt into equity was regarded as an
important additional step towards debt consolidation.
    West German exports to Latin America declined by 4.1 pct in
1986 to 11 billion marks. Shipments to Mexico fell 19 pct to
1.9 billion marks and to Colombia by 15 pct to 600 mln marks,
Mittendorf said.
    Exports to Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador and Central America were
also lower last year than in 1985, while shipments to Brazil
rose 11.5 pct to around two billion marks. Exports to Argentina
went up by over three pct to 1.5 billion marks and those to
Paraguay surged by 42 pct to 106 mln marks, he said.
    Brazil was West Germany's main Latin American supplier, but
shipments fell to 4.4 billion marks from 6.4 billion in 1985.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Turnover in the U.K. Government bond
(gilt) market in February slipped to 81.25 billion stg from
January's 83.37 billion, although it was 165 pct higher than
the 30.63 billion in February 1986, the Stock Exchange said.
    The Stock Exchange noted, however, that turnover between
bond market-makers through the inter-dealer broker (IDB) screen
system, as distinct from business with outside clients, has
only been included from October 1986, meaning that prior data
is not strictly comparable with recent figures.
    The contribution to overall February, 1987 volume from IDB
 business was 43.10 billion stg, against 43.19 in January.
    In the 20 trading days of February, the average daily
volume of business was 4.06 billion stg, against an average of
3.97 billion in January, which had 21 trading days.
    Total Stock Exchange turnover for the month was 116.73
billion stg, marginally higher than the 116.65 billion recorded
in January but 129 pct more than the 50.92 billion of February
1986.

<TITLE>SOUTHWEST REALTY &lt;SWL> HAS LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DALLAS, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>Southwest Realty Ltd said it believes it
could make all of its scheduled montly debt service payments
for 1987 despite the falloff in its rental operations, but
making the payments would probably severely impair its
liquidity and restrict its ability to maintain the quality of
its properties.
    The company today reported a 1986 loss of 1,544,000 dlrs
compared with a 1985 profit of 3,912,000 dlrs.
    Southwest said in addition to its monthly scheduyled debt
service payments, a 1,743,000 dlr loan on one of its Houston
properties is due to mature on April One.
    Southwest said a commitment to reduce the interest rate and
extend the Houston loan for one year has been accepted.
    It said talks are underway with lenders on other Houston
properties to obtain partial debt service moratoriums which, if
granted, would cut 1987 cash deficits from 1986 levels.  The
loan renegotiations could involve bankruptcy or other
litigation connected with the specific properties involved and
could involve the suspension of interest and principal payments
to some of the lenders.  Southwest said if the attempts to
restructure debt do not succeed, it could lose one or more of
the properties.
    Southwest said the Houston properties made up about 10 pct
of its current value equity as of December 31 of 14.20 dlrs per
share, down from 16.68 dlrs a year before.
    The company said depending on the success of the talks and
operating results for 1987, one or two more properties could
become subject to similar negotiations.  The two additional
properties comprised about 11 pct of its current value equity
at year-end, Southwest said.

has repurchased 780,000 common shares from Putnam Mills Corp
principals Sidney and Peter Kaplan for 2.25 dlrs per share.
    It said the purchase price will be applied against the
1,700,000 dlrs Putnam Mills currently owes Pope Evans for
merchandise.  Pope Evans has about 7.6 mln shares outstanding.
    The company also said it has agreed in principle to acquire
privately-held Pat Fashions Industries Inc for 18 mln dlrs in
cash and notes, with financing to come partly from bank
borrowings, subject to approval by the Pope Evans board and Pat
shareholders.
    Pat Fashions imports apparel from the Far East and makes
apparel domestically as well.  In the year ended November 30,
Pat earned 5,400,000 dlrs pretax on sales of 83.0 mln dlrs.

<TITLE>JACOBS SUCHARD SEES 100,000 TONNE COCOA SURPLUS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Jacobs Suchard AG expects a world cocoa
surplus of around 100,000 tonnes in 1987 compared with a
104,000 tonne surplus in 1986, Jens Sroka, head of commodity
buying, told a news conference.
    The company expects prices to remain at around current
levels despite the likelihood of agreement on buffer stock
rules at the forthcoming London cocoa talks, and believes
market intervention by the buffer stock manager would stabilise
prices.
    Sroka said world coffee prices are expected to remain weak
if any international coffee talks fail to produce agreement.
    Sroka said stagnating consumption and slight overproduction
will continue to weigh on coffee prices and he forecast a
continued build-up in stocks.
    The recent failure of the London coffee talks had surprised
market observers.
    Unless reason prevails and the major producers return to
the conference table, the world coffee market will remain free
and the consequences for some producers dependant on coffee for
their foreign exchange earnings would be catastrophic, Sroka
added.

<TITLE>U.S. RETAIL SALES RISE 4.1 PCT IN FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. retail sales rose 4.77 billion
dlrs, or 4.1 pct, in February to a seasonally adjusted 122.29
billion dlrs, the Commerce Department said.
    The increase came after a revised 7.4 pct drop in January
sales to a level of 117.52 billion dlrs. The department
previously reported January retail sales fell 5.8 pct.
    Excluding autos, retail sales in February were up 1.5 pct
after falling by a revised 0.4 pct in January.
    Department spokesmen said the major cause for the revision
downward in January sales was a weaker January auto dealer
sales figure than originally estimated.
    Auto dealer sales were 26.91 billion dlrs in February, a
14.4 pct rise from January levels. But January sales dropped by
27.7 pct from December levels to 23.52 billion dlrs, more than
the 22.4 pct fall originally reported.
    The expiration of the sales tax deduction under new tax
laws on January 1 was the main reason for the drop in January
sales, department spokesmen said.
    Sales of durable goods rose in February by 8.8 pct to 46.72
billion dlrs after dropping by 17.7 pct in January.
    Building materials rose 1.8 pct in February after falling
by 1.7 pct in January.
    Non-durable goods sales rose by 1.3 pct to 75.58 billion
dlrs in February after falling by 0.2 pct in January, the
department said.
    General merchandise stores rose 1.4 pct after increasing
sales by 1.6 pct in January, and department stores were up two
pct in February after rising 1.5 pct in January.
    Food store sales increased 0.4 pct after declining by 1.0
pct in January, while grocery store sales increased 0.3 pct in
February after falling 0.6 pct in January.
    Gasoline service station sales rose 2.0 pct in February
after a 1.9 pct January increase.
    Apparel store sales were up 0.8 pct last month after
falling 3.0 pct in January, while sales at eating and drinking
places increased 1.5 pct after rising 0.5 pct in January.
    February's retail sales were 4.4 pct above the year-ago
level of 117.09 billion dlrs, the department said.

<TITLE>CANADA LEADERS FAIL TO SET PACT ON FREE TRADE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Russell Blinch</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said he
held "frank" discussions with the Canadian province premiers on
the pace of free trade talks with the United States, but the
longstanding issue of provincial ratification remains to be
settled.
    Speaking to reporters after nearly five hours of meetings
with the 10 premiers, Mulroney said further discussions would
be held in June and September to discuss the role of the
provinces in approving any new trade deal.
    But he maintained progress was being made in the sweeping
talks with the Unites States that got under nearly two years
ago.
    "It appears reasonable progress is being made (in the
talks)," Mulroney said.
    Alberta Premier Don Getty agreed, "Things are running pretty
quickly now."
    The talks, launched by Mulroney's Progressive Conservative
government after concerns about protectionist sentiment in the
U.S., are aimed reducing the remaining barriers between the
world's largest trading partnership.
    But the provinces are expected to play a major role in any
new trading arrangement, and some of the provincial leaders
complained of a lack of progress on reaching a ratification
formula.
    "It's my view that we should be thinking about these things
right now, along with the questions of the substance of the
agreement," commented Ontario Premier David Peterson, who has
been highly critical of the talks in the past.
    But Newfoundland Premier Brian Peckford said an agreement
was more likely to emerge by consensus and there would be no
need for a "hard and fast formula."
    Peckford said it appears Canada is prepared to make
concessions to the United States on financial services in order
to make inroads on other bargaining areas, such as agriculture.
    Canadian published reports, quoting government sources, say
the two countries are close to reaching a trade deal and it
will involve eliminating border tariffs and many non-tariff
barriers over the next 10 to 12 years.
    A rough draft of the accord is expected to be presented to
the premiers at the June meeting while the finished document is
hoped to be presented to Congress in October.
    "It's a very tight time frame," Ontario's Peterson said last
night. "But at this moment it is tough to say what will
transpire."

<TITLE>BALDRIGE OPPOSES JAPANESE PURCHASE OF FIRM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige
has asked the White House to consider blocking the planned
Japanese acquisition of a major U.S. supercomputer and
semiconductor manufacturer for national security reasons, U.S.
officials said.
    The officials, who asked not to be named, said yesterday
that Baldrige has "serious concerns" about the sale of Fairchild
Semiconductor Corp. to Fujitsu Ltd., another major electronics
firm.
    The officials told Reuters that if the sale went through it
could leave the U.S. military overly dependent on a foreign
/ompany for vital high technology equipment used in its
advanced missiles, aircraft electronics and intelligence
gathering.
    In addition, they said, the sale would also worsen the
already strained trade relations between the U.S. and Japan
stemming from the huge Japanese surplus.
    The White House Economic Policy Council would consider the
sale in the coming weeks, they said.
    Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger's position was not
immediately known but in the past he has opposed the transfer
of high technology to foreign governments and companies.
    Supercomputers made by Fairchild and other U.S.
manufacturers are widely used throughout the world, but none
have been sold to the Japanese government or to Japanese
government-run agencies and universities.

<TITLE>SAND TECHNOLOGY &lt;SNDCF> MULLING REVERSE SPLIT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Solange De Santis</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    Toronto, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sand Technology Systems Inc said it is
considering a reverse stock split of at least one-for-10 and
expects to report a second-quarter profit, compared to a loss
last year.
    The stock consolidation "is something we're discussing, but
it's not definite," Sand Technology president Jerry Shattner
told Reuters in an interview.
    A private placement recently brought the number of
outstanding shares to 106 mln, up from 97.1 mln shares on July
31, 1986, the fiscal yearend.
    "The company has always had the aura of a penny stock,"
Shattner said, adding that Sand plans, at some time, to apply
for listing on the Montreal Stock Exchange.
    Shattner said the company expects to report a profit of
five pct, or about 350,000 dlrs, on sales of seven mln dlrs,
for the second quarter ended January 31. Results for the third
quarter should be about the same as the second, he added.
    Last year, Sand lost 243,064 dlrs on revenues of 7,012,195
dlrs in the second quarter.
    After "a disastrous first quarter," Sand hopes to break even
in the current fiscal year, Shattner said. The company has
scaled back its sales forecast to about 25 mln dlrs, from the
33.5 mln dlrs projected in December.
    The rapid appreciation of the Japanese yen against U.S. and
Canadian dollars last year led to Sand's loss of 2.1 mln dlrs,
or two cts per share, on sales of 24.9 mln dlrs.
    In the first fiscal quarter this year, the company lost
1,350,387 dlrs, or one ct per share, on sales of 3,570,585
dlrs.
    Shattner believes the company will post better results this
year due to several factors.
    "Last year, one of our biggest problems was we were buying
products in Japanese yen. We now buy some products from Hitachi
in U.S. dollars and the results are starting to show up in the
second quarter," he said.
    Sand Technology sells, under its trademark, computer
accessories such as disk drives, solid-state memory enhancement
devices and printers manufactured by Hitachi Ltd &lt;HIT> of
Japan.
    Shattner said Sand's affiliate in Detroit, ST Systems Inc,
is developing software that lets large maniframe computers
handle large databases and share them between applications.
    It is also distributing a new product called Sapiens, which
is artificial intelligence computer language for use by major
corporations.
    The company has also reduced costs through some staff
cutting and a switch to profit sharing plans for sales staff
instead of straight commissions, Shattner said.
    And Sand plans to market a laser printer in the fourth
fiscal quarter, Shattner said.

<TITLE>JAPAN ECONOMY MAY BE NEAR BOTTOM, ECONOMISTS SAY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rich Miller, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>The worst may be just about over for
Japan's battered economy but economists said they do not expect
a vigorous recovery anytime soon. Japanese bank economists
polled by Reuters said the economy's 18 month-old slowdown is
likely to end in the first half of this year, helped by rising
exports, stepped-up government spending and falling prices. "The
economy will bottom out in the middle of the year," said
Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist, Masahiko Koido.
    Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd senior economist Susumu
Taketomi agreed. "It (the bottom) is in the offing," he said.
    But he added that the recovery will be slow. Growth in the
fiscal year beginning next month will only pick-up 2.2 pct,
from two pct in the current year, he said.
    Signs that the economy has just about weathered the worst
are increasing.
    The volume of exports in the first two months of the year
rose slightly on a year-on-year basis, after declining toward
the end of last year.
    Although this may be due to extraordinary factors such as a
sharp rise in car exports to rebuild depleted European stocks,
several economists said it could mark the beginning of a
recovery.
    Industrial production fell 0.7 pct in January, much smaller
than expected, and is forecast by the government to rise 0.3
pct in February and 2.6 pct in March. A Bank of Japan survey
released last week showed that the decline in Japanese
corporate earnings may be nearing its end.
    And the Paris currency accord last month has fostered hopes
the rapid yen rise has come to the end, they said.
    Six nations - the U.K., Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And
West Germany - pledged in Paris last month to stabilise
currencies around current levels.
    The yen's 40 pct climb against the dollar over the last two
years has hit the export-driven economy hard, by forcing its
companies to raise prices and lose sales in the U.S. Market.
    "The important thing is the exchange rate," Taketomi said.
    If it stabilises firms will grow more confident and raise
investment in plant and equipment, although there are no signs
of that yet, economists said.
    A stable yen would also help exporters regain some of their
competitive edge just as the U.S economy may be starting to
recover, economists said.
    Domestically, the economy may get a boost from some
loosening of the government's tight fiscal policy said Haruo
Muto, manager of national economics at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd.
    The next reading of the economy's health should come early
next week with the release of gnp figures for the last quarter,
1986.
    Most private economists expect a rise of about 0.5 pct from
the previous quarter. In the third quarter, GNP rose 0.6 pct.
    But a senior government official said the fourth quarter
figures could surprise by showing a rise of more than one point
quarter-on-quarter. But he added that would be a statistical
aberration and not a significant shift in economic activity.
    To maintain year-on-year growth of around 2.5 pct, the
economy would have had to rise about 1.2 pct in the fourth
quarter as the final quarter of 1985 was strong.
     The rise in the fourth quarter of 1985 was probably a
statistical anomaly that was repeated in the final months of
1986, the official said.
    Economists said the fourth quarter figures were also
distorted by the government's sale of gold coins in the second
half of 1986.
    Because the coins were classified as legal tender, their
purchase did not show up in the statistics on consumer
expenditure. Consumer spending also tailed off in December
because of bad weather and smaller-than-normal end-year
bonuses, they said.
    As the government had to buy back some of the coins from
retailers because they were unsold, the government's
contribution to the economy in the fourth quarter may have been
boosted, economists said.
    Taketomi said it may have received a further boost from
government buying of farm products as the domestic crop last
year was good.
    The senior government official said the fourth quarter
performance of the domestic sector was probably worse than
generally expected, while that of the external sector was
better.

<TITLE>BANKERS OPPOSE STRICT TAIWAN CURRENCY CONTROLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Taiwan imposed currency controls today
in what bankers called a desperate move to prevent speculation
as the Taiwan dollar appreciated against the U.S. currency.
    The strict controls will require proof that large
remittances to Taiwan are connected to commercial transactions
rather than currency speculation.
    Bankers attacked the controls as ineffective, saying they
were a panic reaction to pressure from Washington for faster
appreciation of the Taiwan currency against the U.S. dollar,
which would slow exports to the United States.
    Remittances exceeding one mln dlrs earned through exports,
shipping, insurance or bank lending will now need government
approval, along with remittances of more than 10,000 dlrs from
any other source.

    The move was to allow greater access to Taiwan markets by

    Import curbs on about 400 foreign goods, including

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.K. Retailers expect consumer spending
to accelerate in March after a disappointing increase in
February, according to a monthly survey by the Confederation of
British Industry (CBI).
    Fifty-nine pct of the 325 retailers questioned for the
latest Distributive Trades Survey expected sales to be higher
in March than they were in March 1986, with only six pct
expecting lower sales.
    The chairman of the Distributive Trades Survey Panel, Nigel
Whittaker, said a favourable Budget next week would further
help sales during the summer.
    Figures released earlier this week showed retail sales in
January fell 2.2 pct, mainly due to exceptionally cold weather.
    "Sales did not recover in February as much as retailers had
expected, and they are now looking for better business in
March," today's survey said.
    It reported clothing stores were the most optimistic, with
80 pct expecting sales in March to be higher than a year ago.
    Wholesalers also expected stronger sales in March, while
both retailers and wholesalers reported slower growth in import
penetration, it said.

<TITLE>MOST JAPAN FIRMS NOT RENEWING IRAN TERM CONTRACTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jennie Kantyka, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Most Japanese companies have decided not
to renew term contracts to lift Iranian crude oil because spot
prices remain considerably lower than OPEC's official levels,
industry sources said.
    They said a cargo of the Mideast benchmark crude Dubai
traded yesterday at 16.50 dlrs a barrel, compared to its
official price of 17.42 dlrs.
    Only one Japanese company has renewed its term contract for
Iranian crude oil for the second quarter, the sources said.
    The sources said Japanese companies had been lifting a
total of about 185,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian crude
under term contracts, but only one firm has agreed to lift in
the second quarter. It is lifting just 10,000 to 15,000 bpd.
    They said this move could inspire Iran to offer discounts
on cargoes loading in April, but the likelihood of discounts
depended largely on the levels of spot prices.
    "If the spot price of Dubai goes above 17.30 dlrs we would
probably buy Iranian crude at the official price," one Japanese
refiner said.
    "We don't intend to put pressure on them," he added.
    Buyers have little incentive to renew contracts to lift oil
at official OPEC prices while spot prices on all grades are
considerably lower, oil traders said.
    They said if spot prices move higher there will be no
problem finding OPEC crude to purchase at the official prices.
Qatar has chartered floating storage for its crude oil after
finding no buyers at official prices in March. The problem is
likely to recur in April, adding to that country's surplus.
    The traders added that Iraq had dissociated itself from
OPEC's December production agreement, while agreeing to the
fixed prices.
    But oil analysts said if OPEC keeps group output close to
its first-half 1987 ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd, supply and demand
would be balanced by the end of the second quarter.
    They also said if OPEC holds its official price structure
based on a reference price of 18 dlrs, spot price fluctuations
should be limited to a 16.50 to 17.20 dlrs range for Dubai and
a 17 to 18 dlrs range for the North Sea's Brent blend.
    One Japanese refiner said, "At the moment there's a lot of
pressure on OPEC, particularly on Qatar. But if they hold out
there will be no problem, and I'm beginning to trust their
ability."
    Nigerian oil minister and OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman
told a news conference in Lagos yesterday, "Nigeria and all
member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the
December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas
and official selling prices."
    He said OPEC believed consumers had drawn heavily on stocks
of both crude oil and refined products, reducing them to levels
well below this time last year. He said consumers would soon
return to the market in search of crude.
    A Japanese refiner said, "The European and U.S. Markets are
beginning to look better so OPEC might be quite lucky."

<TITLE>JAMAICA PUTS CAP ON BORROWING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KINGSTON, Jamaica, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Jamaica has put a cap on its
3.5 billion dlr foreign debt and will reduce its obligations by
300 mln dlrs this year, Prime Minister Edward Seaga said.
    Seaga yesterday said Jamaica has reached its "maximum stock
of debt" and will not undertake any more borrowing until it was
justified by economic growth. "This year we'll be reducing the
stock of debt by 300 mln dlrs," he said.
    He said his government aims to get Jamaica's ratio of debt
payments to foreign exchange earnings down from the current
level of 50 pct to 25 pct over the next two to three years.
Debt payments this year are expected to total 287 mln dlrs,
Seaga said. Seaga yesterday concluded an agreement with
Jamaica's creditor banks to reschedule some 181 mln dlrs due in
1987-89 over the next 12 years.

chairman Derek Keys cautioned that profits may not rise this
year if the rand stays at its current level of 48 U.S. Cents.
    "We would do well to repeat last year's results if the rand

    The level of the dividend, however, "ought not to be

<TITLE>EC COMMISSION HAS OPEN ATTITUDE ON STEEL QUOTAS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STRASBOURG, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>The EC Commission said it was
adopting an "open attitude" about whether a system of production
quotas should remain for the indefinite future on heavy steel
products which account for about 45 pct of all EC steel goods.
    In a statement, the Commission reiterated its view that the
industry needs to lose between 25 and 30 mln tonnes of capacity
by 1990. It had previously said the quota system, started in
1980, should be wound up completely by the end of next year.
    The industry has argued for the maintenance of existing
quotas, which cover almost 70 pct of all output, saying almost
all steelmakers are losing money due to the depressed market.

<TITLE>K MART &lt;KM> SAYS RECORD 1986 NET "TURNING POINT"</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     TROY, Mich., March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>K Mart Corp said its record fiscal
1986 net earnings of 582.3 mln dlrs, a rise from 221.2 mln dlrs
a year ago, marked a "major turning point" for the world's
second biggest retailer.
    K Mart said the earnings rise for the fourth quarter ended
January 28 to 285 mln dlrs from 10.5 mln dlrs resulted from 
"merchandising, refurbishing and expense control."
    A year ago, K Mart took a charge of 239 mln dlrs for
discontinued operations. Earnings from continuing retail
operations in the quarter totalled 270 mln dlrs or 2.00 dlrs a
share compared with 249.4 mln dlrs or 1.91 dlrs a year ago.
    K Mart Chairman Bernard Fauber said "the success of these
programs is better illustrated by the strong 35.9 pct increase
in 1986 income from continuing operations before income taxes
to 1.03 billion dlrs, the first time K Mart Corp has reached
this milestone."
    Sales for the 1986 fiscal year reached a record 23.8
billion dlrs, an 8.1 pct rise from 22.04 billion dlrs the prior
year. K Mart said 1985 was restated to account for discontinued
operations. Comparable store sales rose 5.5 pct in 1986 over
1985, it said.
    Fauber said the sales growth came from greater consumer
acceptance of K Mart's apparel merchandise, "a marked increase
in hardline merchandise sales and a growing contribution from
specialty retailing operations."
    K Mart said its fourth quarter pre-tax income from
continuing operations was 493 mln dlrs, a 32.3 pct gain from
372.6 mln dlrs last year. It said sales in the period grew 8.8
pct to 7.23 billion dlrs from a restated 6.65 billion dlrs in
1985 with comparable store sales up 4.7 pct.
    K Mart said its effective tax rate rose in 1986 to 44.6 pct
from 37.6 pct in 1985. But it said selling, general and
administrative expense eased to 23.2 pct of sales from 23.7 pct
in 1985.
    "Our performance in 1986 marks a major turning point for K
Mart," Fauber said in a statement.
    "In the years immediately prior to 1986, we focused on
changing the look of our stores and the structure of the
company."
    K Mart, he said, committed billion of dollars for store
remodeling and installing a centralized point of sale system,
upgraded its merchandise mix, acquired three large specialty
retailers, divested underperforming businesses and restructured
its long-term debt.
    "We were forced to pay a temporary price in the form of
slower earnings growth and a lower rating by the investment
community. However, beginning with the fourth quarter of 1985,
our improved performance is proof that our approach is correct
for the long term," the K Mart chairman said.

<TITLE>ROCKEFELLER SAYS BRAZIL SOLUTION WILL BE FOUND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>David Rockefeller, chairman of the
international advisory committee of Chase Manhattan Bank NA,
said an accommodation would be found between Brazil and its
commercial bank creditors to solve the problem of the nation's
recent interest payment halt.
    "I think one will find that the banking community, the
Brazilian government and the international banking authorities
will be talking for the next several weeks and I am very
hopeful that we would find an accommodation." Rockefeller told
bankers at a luncheon.
    Brazil announced on February 20 that it was suspending
interest repayments on about 68 billion dlrs of private sector
debt owed to commercial banks.
    Rockefeller said the recent tour by Brazilian Finance
Minister Dilson Funaro of major industrial nations was a sign
that Brazil wanted to be cooperative. But it was notable that
Funaro did not meet with the creditors immediately affected,
the commercial bankers, he added.
    Brazil's moratorium on commercial debt becomes critical by
end-May, when payments would be 90 days overdue, obliging U.S.
Regulators to downgrade Brazilian debt, financial sources said.
    This would require banks in turn to cease accruing interest
and set aside expensive loan loss reserves.
    Rockefeller reminded bankers of the depth of concern over
Latin American debt at the Toronto World Bank/International
Monetary Fund meeting in 1982, and said an accord would be
reached in the current circumstances just as it had been then.
    "(Brazilian authorities) have no more interest in seeing
their credit sources cut off then we have in seeing their
obligations stop," he added.

<TITLE>PHILLIPS &lt;P> TO EMPHASIZE CASH FLOW TO PARE DEBT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Ted D'Afflisio, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Phillips Petroleum Co will emphasize
improving its short-term cash flow this year to pare its debt,
C.J. "Pete" Silas, chairman, told Reuters in an interview.
    "Our priority is to get cash flow increased from the assets
already installed," he said, but he declined to estimate annual
cash flow for 1987.
    Analysts estimate Phillips" cash flow at over one billion
dlrs for 1987, while long term debt, which resulted from
restructuring to find off corporate raiders in 1985, hovers
about 5.9 billion dlrs as of December 1986.
     Silas said Phillips hope to achieve its goal by raising
the capital expenditures budget to develop its oil and gas
properties.
    "We plan to develop the properties with short-term high cash
flow prospects," he said. He projected a capital expenditure
budget of 730 mln dlrs, up from the 1986 expenditure of 655 mln
dlrs.
    Nearly half of that will be spent on exploration and
production, and most of that will be spend overseas, Silas
said.
    "Phillips' top priority in 1987 will be to get the
waterflooding in Norway and jack up the (Ekofisk) oil fields to
improve our ability to extract oil and increase earnings," Silas
said.
     Phillips estimates that the project, which is expected to
cost 1.5 billion dlrs, will increase recovery by 170 mln gross
barrels of oil over a period of 24 years.
    Phillips is also pursue opportunities in China where Silas
said he was seeking "a modification of terms with the Chinese
government to make oil discoveries (in the offshore Xijang
fields) commercially viable."
    In the U.S. Silas said Phillips hopes to get the Point
Arguello, Calif., field started up by the fourth quarter. "We
expect to start up the first platform then," Silas said.
    But emphasis on short-term cash flow has also forced the
company to part with several oil and gas assets.
    Phillips sold its interests in the T-Block in the U.K.
North Sea and U.S. reserves totaling about 1.3 billion dlrs in
1986 as part of a two billion dlrs asset sales program that is
now completed, Silas said.
     "We sold high cost producing assets. They were not good
value for us but possibly so for someone else," Silas said.
    Silas said the 1986 assets sales will not affect earnings
for the company.
    "Everything we are doing is to manage our cash flow and we
are using that to manage our debt. Even the asset sales, while
regrettable, were necessary to reduce debt," Silas said.
    He said no asset sales are planned this year as long as oil
prices don't fall sharply lower and stay at lower levels  for
several months. "Then, everyone would be looking at sales (of
assets), and we're no different from the others," Silas said.
    In other areas, Silas looks for improved earnings from
Phillips chemical operations, which provided 299 mln dlrs in
earnings for 1986, up from 219 mln dlrs in 1985.
    "This was our second best year pushed by a good supply and
demand balance for products, low feedstocks and energy costs
for our operations," Silas said, "In 1987 we think the market's
supply and demand balance will be just as good but feedstock
and energy costs will rise due to price recovery."

<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Merrill Lynch Canada Inc, wholly owned
by Merrill Lynch and Co, is considering acquiring another
Canadian securities company as the result of federal and
provincial government moves to lift investment dealer ownership
restrictions on June 30, according to a published report.
    "We're talking to a number of people," Merrill Lynch Canada
deputy chairman E. Duff Scott told The Toronto Star. "Whether
we're going to do something, I don't know," he said.
    A Merrill Lynch Canada spokesman declined to comment on the
newspaper report when queried.
    Scott did not disclose which investment dealers Merrill
Lynch Canada was considering acquiring, but the Toronto Star
quoted unidentified industry sources as saying serious
discussions have already been held with Burns Fry Ltd.
    Burns Fry chairman Jack Lawrence told the newspaper the
investment dealer has not made a final decision, but was
examining "three or four alternatives."
    Discussions between brokers about possible mergers is to be
expected pending industry deregulation, one investment industry
source, who asked not to be named, told Reuters.
    "It's silly not to take a look (at making a merger or
acquisition). If you're a businessman, you have to take a look,"
the industry source said.
    Under federal and provincial government regulations
expected to be in place by June 30, banks, trust companies and
foreign companies will be allowed to acquire existing
investment dealers or establish their own securities
subsidiaries.

<TITLE>SAUDI OUTPUT SAID AT YEAR LOW TO HELP OPEC</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Philip Shehadi, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    RIYADH, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Saudi Arabian oil output has fallen to
its lowest level in more than a year, giving fresh evidence of
the kingdom's determination to keep oil prices at 18 dlrs a
barrel, as agreed by Opec last December, oil industry sources
said.
    They said Saudi output in the first eight days of March
averaged 2.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) including oil from the
neutral zone shared with Kuwait, compared to a February average
of 3.5 mln bpd.
    They said Saudi Arabia was also selling oil from its crude
oil stocks in tankers around the world, which OPEC says must be
counted towards a member's production quota. Saudi Arabia's
quota is 4.133 mln bpd.
    The lower production levels indicated Saudi Arabia, the
world"s largest oil exporter, was insisting on getting Opec
official prices, even at the cost of lower production, the
sources said.
    King Fahd reiterated yesterday, in an interview with
Reuters and the television news agency Visnews, the Saudi
commitment to OPEC's December pact to boost oil prices to an
average 18 dlrs.
    "Saudi Arabia is completely sticking to OPEC decisions," he
said.
    The sources said the kingdom's exports from Gulf ports
averaged one mln bpd during the eight days ending last Sunday,
down from a February average of 1.9 mln bpd.
    They said Saudi Arabia was allowing production to fluctuate
with lifting nominations and was not trying to maintain
artificially high levels by putting oil into storage.
    The kingdom's main buyers, the four U.S. Oil firms with
past stakes in the national oil company Aramco -- Mobil, Exxon,
Texaco and Chevron -- enjoy considerable flexibility in the
timing and volume of their liftings but are bound to pay
official prices, the sources said.
    Spot market prices have firmed in the past two weeks but
still remain below OPEC levels and major buyers have delayed
liftings in the hope they would improve, the sources said.
    They expected low early March output to pick up towards the
end of the month as buyers sought to fulfill their contractual
obligations.

<TITLE>TREASURY OFFICIAL SAYS PHILIPPINE PACT VERY NEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>An agreement in the debt rescheduling
talks between the Philippines and its commercial bank advisory
committee seems to be close at hand, said David Mulford,
Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Treasury.
    "The Philippines negotiations resumed in early March and
agreement now appears to be very near," Mulford told a debt
conference, organized by the Euromoney magazine.
    Mulford gave no further details. He told reporters after
his speech that he had no information on the banks' response to
the Philippines' revised proposal, based on partial payment of
interest with investment notes instead of cash.
    Progress in the Philippines talks, following recent
agreements with Mexico, Chile and Venezuela, will help to
dispel concerns of a new debt crisis, Mulford told the
conference.
    However, he said there will continue to be difficulties and
periods of significant risk, requiring creative thinking on the
part of the banks.
    In particular, he urged the banks to develop a "menu of
options for supporting debtor reforms as a means of maintaining
broad bank participation in new financing packages."
    Mulford said the banks should be able to offer a range of
options to members of the lending syndicates, provided that the
liquidity value of the total transactions to the debtor nations
is equivalent to the banks' new money obligation.
    He said it is more important to find ways of encouraging
banks to remain in the syndicates than to find ways of enabling
them to quit the lending groups.
    Mulford said his menu of options could include more trade
credits, direct portfolio investments, debt/equity swaps,
project loans, co-financings and the invesmtent note concept,
which has been proposed by the Philippines.

<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sweden announced its promised program
of unilateral economic sanctions against South Africa and gave
firms an October deadline to cut trading links.
    Foreign Trade Minister Anita Gradin said a trade boycott of
South Africa and neighbouring Namibia would take effect from
July 1, followed by a three-month period of grace to give
companies time to wind down their operations.
    From October 1, no direct trade would be allowed in either
direction, with certain exceptions covering medical supplies
and printed matter, Gradin told a news conference.
    She said exceptions would also be granted in cases where a
Swedish trade boycott would benefit South African firms and
disadvantage South Africa's black-ruled neighbours, the
front-line states.
    Gradin cautioned that legislation upon which the boycott
would be based was not impossible to get round. She said a
parliamentary committee would investigate ways of closing some
of the bigger loopholes, including indirect trade with South
Africa via Swedish subsidiaries in third countries.

<TITLE>BRITISH TELECOM CAUTIOUS ON EARNINGS PROSPECTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>British Telecommunications Plc's &lt;BTY.L>
profit growth prospects for the coming years will be reduced by
increasing competition and continued costs for replacing old
telephone systems, deputy chairman Graeme Odgers said.
    Speaking at a news conference on the third quarter results
which were released earlier today, Odgers said the company
faced heavy costs for installing new digital telephone systems
in Britain for three to five years.
    He said &lt;Mercury Communications Ltd>, a Cable and Wireless
Plc &lt;CAWL.L> subsidiary, was becoming a significant competitor.
    Odgers said Mercury was seeking to make inroads into some
of British Telecom's most profitable areas.
    One company official privately estimated that British
Telecom still had a 99 pct share of the U.K. Telecommunications
market but feared that this could slip to 95 or 90 pct.
    The recent two-and-a-half-week engineering strike, which
lead to some disruption in service, could well have encouraged
clients to consider using the Mercury system, Odgers said.
    However, he forecast that the last quarter's results
overall should not be adversely affected by the walkout.
    He calculated salary savings as a result of the strike at
50 mln stg and while loss of income on telephone calls should
be limited revenue probably dropped on peripheral activities.
    But on balance Odgers said that group's financial strength,
economies of scale and the fact that it operates in a growth
industry will help produce annual profit increases for the
forseeable future.
    British Telecom will also seek to expand into
manufacturing, he said, adding that research and development
expenditure will rise both in terms of value and compared with
the current proportion of two pct of overall turnover.
    Analysts said the company's downbeat forecasts helped
shares dip to 242p in mid-afternoon, down 4p from yesterday's
close and off an early high of 248p.
    Philip Augar of stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co Ltd said
the market expects slower profit growth, but forecast a seven
to eight pct rise in both earnings per share and pretax profit
over the next two years. In the 1985/86 financial year, pre-tax
profit rose to 1.81 billion stg from 1.48 billion.
    Augar noted that a government-imposed formula linking
charges to inflation meant that the company's scope for raising
prices was limited as long as inflation remains low.

<TITLE>NO NEAR TERM BRAZIL COFFEE MOVES EXPECTED</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Richard Jarvie, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Brazilian Coffee Institute,
IBC, is unlikely to disclose its future export policy until the
end of next week at the earliest, trade sources said.
    IBC president Jorio Dauster is meeting government
ministers, producers, exporters and market analysts to assess
Brazil's position in the light of the failure of talks in
London earlier this month to set new International Coffee
Organization, ICO, export quotas.
    "The failure of the talks means Brazil has got to rethink
its position completely," one Santos exporter said.
    A meeting of the National Coffee Policy Council is set for
Thursday, March 19, and Dauster will almost certainly explain
his plan to members then before announcing any new measures.
    Dauster told reporters on his return from London last week
that no decisions would be made on exports before he had held
talks with all sectors of the industry.
    Exporters said Dauster is not under any great pressure to
start marketing coffee immediately. World prices have been
recovering from the lows which followed the collapse of the ICO
talks and Brazil has sold a reasonable 5.5 mln bags of 60 kilos
for export in the first four months of this year.
    The exporters said the key factor in the eventual opening
of May and June export registrations will be the amount at
which the contribution quota is set.
    With little expectation of other sales incentive mechanisms
such as discounts, bonuses and price fall guarantees being
introduced, the level of the quota will be decisive in
determining the competitiveness of Brazilian coffee on world
markets, they said.
    They noted that on February 16, the eve of a planned
increase in the quota, April registrations were opened and
closed after 1.68 mln bags were registered for export, a record
amount for a single day.
    If May/June registrations are opened under similar
conditions as before, Brazil would have no difficulty in
selling at least 2.0 mln bags per month.
    "The problem would be how to limit sales," one exporter said.
    Brazil's present foreign trade and payments problems mean
there are pressures from the government to boost exports to
maximise foreign exchange earnings.
    However, the sources said they expect the IBC to adopt a
marketing strategy aimed at regaining Brazil's dominant
position as an exporter, but without causing a price war.
    General opinion among exporters was that Brazil would plan
to export between 17 and 18 mln bags this year of which between
1.5 and 2.0 mln would be to non-members of the ICO.
    The 15.5 mln to 16 mln bags sold to members would be around
the figure Brazil had offered to ship if ICO quotas were
reintroduced, although Dauster has said this offer expired with
the breakdown of talks.
    With the prospects of a crop of at least 28 mln bags this
year, Brazil has the capacity to export up to 20 mln bags after
meeting local consumption of around 7.0 mln, the sources added.
    However, the sources said Brazil is unlikely even to
consider exporting such quantities, as this would almost
inevitably lead to a fall in world prices as Brazil tried to
encroach on other producers' markets.
    Maximum export earnings would be achieved by orderly
marketing of traditional amounts, thus re-establishing Brazil's
market share after last year's unusually low exports of 9.9 mln
bags, enabling it to rebuild stocks and maintaining cordial
relations with the producer group which backed Brazil's stance
at the ICO talks, they added.

<TITLE>INSTINET &lt;INET> SETS MEETING ON MERGER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Instinet Corp said its board has
scheduled a special shareholders' meeting for May 21 to vote on
its proposed merger into Reuters Holdings PLC &lt;RTRSY>.
    It said shareholders of record as of April 10 will be
eligible to vote at the meeting.
    Instinet said the meeting date is subject to adjustment,
based on the length of time needed for the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission to complete its review of the filing of
merger proxy materials, which Instinet expects to make before
the end of March.
    Instinet said the filing of the preliminary merger proxy
materials is tied to the finalization of audited financial
statements of Instinet and Reuters for 1986.
    Under a merger agreement entered into in November, Reuters
tendered for up to 5.10 mln Instinet common shares, or about 45
pct of those not already owned by Reuters. As a result of the
tender, Reuters now owns about 49 pct of Instinet shares.
    In the merger, holders of remaining Instinet shares will
receive 8.50 dlrs of Reuters American Depositary Shares for
each Instinet share.
    The ADS's will be valued at the average of their closing
prices in the 10 trading days before the effective date of the
merger.
    Instinet said it expects the merger to become effective as
soon as possible after shareholder approval at the special
meeting.

<TITLE>PORTUGAL GRAIN AGENCY BARRED FROM IMPORT TENDERS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Pascal Fletcher, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LISBON, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>A Portuguese court has made a
preliminary ruling that the state grain buying agency EPAC
should not be allowed to take part in public import tenders
open to private importers, grain traders and officials said.
    Under the terms of Portugal's January 1986 accession to the
European Community, EC, a grain import monopoly held by EPAC
(Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais) is being reduced
by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990.
    Private traders protested last year that EPAC was being
permitted to take part in tenders open to them for the first
liberalised 20 pct share of the country's annual import needs.
The grain and oilseed importers association ACICO opened legal
proceedings to stop EPAC participating in the public tenders.
    Miguel Ascensao of ACICO told Reuters that Lisbon's civil
court, in a preliminary ruling, had decided EPAC should not be
allowed to take part in tenders open to private traders.
    Trade sources said the ruling, though effective
immediately, was subject to appeal and would have to be
confirmed in further proceedings.
    A member of the government Cereals Market Commission said
that, as a result of the court's decision, the Commission would
not be able to accept offers from EPAC in a public tender being
held today for the import of 80,000 tonnes of corn.
    Ascensao said the court ruling stated that EPAC's
participation in the public tenders violated the clauses of
Portugal's EC accession treaty dealing with the gradual
dismantling of the state agency's import monopoly.
    It also said the participation of EPAC, which still
controls the national grain storage and distribution network,
was unfair competition to the private traders.
    Traders said they believed the EC's Executive Commission
was unlikely to get involved in the dispute, preferring to
leave the case to be resolved as an internal Portuguese issue.
    "They (the EC Commission) will be keeping a low profile," one
trader said.
    ACICO says it is ready to take its case to Brussels if
necessary.

<TITLE>U.S. RETAIL SALES RISE MASKS WEAK TREND - ANALYSTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Kathleen Hays, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. retail sales rose sharply in
February but many economists said the underlying consumer
spending trend remains weak.
    February retail sales jumped 4.1 pct, more than the 2.5-3.0
pct rise the financial markets had anticipated. But January's
sales were revised down to a 7.4 pct drop, from a previously
reported 5.8 pct decline.
    "The trend is toward continued spending but certainly at a
much more sluggish pace," said Don Maude of Midland Montagu
Capital Markets Inc.
    Maude averaged out the wide swings in the retail sales data
over past four months to show that the pace of consumer
spending is slowing.
    Combining the latest data with a 0.6 pct drop in November
and a 4.6 pct gain in December, the average retail sales gain
over the four months was 0.2 pct, he said, compared to to a 0.4
pct rise for year-over-year sales through February.
    "You can see a pattern developing," Maude said. "I wouldn't
be surprised to see a fall-off in March, especially since sales
probably won't be boosted by auto sales as they were in
February."
    Despite the weak underlying trend, economists were
impressed by a robust 1.5 pct gain in total sales excluding
autos in February. This compared to a revised 0.4 pct decline
in January, previously reported as a 0.1 pct decline.
    "The increase in non-auto sales was broadbased, with gains
in durable goods as well as non-durables," noted Ward McCarthy
of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. "It was a pretty healthy
report."
    He noted that building materials rose 1.8 pct in February
after falling 1.7 pct in January. General merchandise store
sales gained 1.4 pct after a 1.6 pct rise in January.
    "There are signs of life in the economy," McCarthy said.
"But it's jumping to conclusions to extrapolate this report
into the future." 
    A 0.7 pct increase in disposable personal income in January
which may be linked to the new tax laws probably helped boost
spending in February, he said.
    "A lot of people may be inadvertently under-withholding
taxes from their paychecks," he said. "When people in this
country get an increase in disposable income, the inclination
is to go out and spend it," he said.
    Economists said tomorrow's release of U.S. auto sales for
the first 10 days of March will be an important indicator of
how much this sector will add to first quarter spending.
     Auto sales accounted for the lion's share of total
February sales, rising 14.4 pct. This followed a 27.7 pct drop
in January, previously reported as a 22.4 pct fall, due largely
to the expiration of the sales tax deduction under new tax laws
January 1, the Commerce Department noted.
    Some economists argued that the because the gain in total
sales excluding autos also followed a decline in January, the
strength in the February report is less than impressive.
    "There is strength in the February data, but that's because
they were compared to low sales levels in January," said said
Beth Reiners of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "We don't see it as a
precursor of continued strength."
    Durable goods sales rose 8.8 pct in February, after falling
17.7 pct in January. February non-durable goods sales gained
1.3 pct, after declining 0.2 pct in January.
    Gasoline service station sales rose two pct in February,
following a 1.9 pct gain in January, but economists said higher
oil prices rather than an increased volume of gas sales
probably accounted for these gains.
    Reiners also emphasized that the trend in consumer spending
is weakening. Total retail sales on average were 123 billion
dlrs in the fourth quarter of 1986, she said. In January, they
fell to a seasonally adjusted 117.52 bilion dlrs, and in
February rose to 122.29 billion dlrs.
    "On average, it looks like they'll total 120 to 121 mln
dlrs in the first quartrer," she said. "We don't look at this
as indication that the economy is barrelling along."
    "The number is not really that problematic for those of us
who are constructive on the bond market," agreed Elliot Platt
of Donaldsen Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp.
    Platt does not foresee potential for tighter monetary
policy on the basis of the latest retail sales report.
    "The Fed is on hold now because the data have been so
confusing," he said.
    "Before the 337,000 gain in February non-farm payroll
employment, I would have looked for a discount rate cut in
March," he said. "But now Fed officials will have to wait for
the first quarter real U.S. gross national product data in
April to sort things out."

<TITLE>MAGMA &lt;MGCPV> SEES PROFITABLE COPPER PRODUCTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Newmont Mining Corp &lt;NEM> said Magma
Copper Co anticipates being able to produce copper at a profit
by 1991, assuming copper prices remain at their current levels.
    In an information statement distributed to Newmont
shareholders explaining the dividend of Magma shares declared
Tuesday, Newmont said Magma had a net loss of 46.6 mln dlrs in
1986, adding this was equal to 1.22 cts a share.
    Newmont holders will receive 80 pct of Magma's stock as a
dividend of one share for each of the 30,458,000 Newmont shares
now held. Newmont will retain 15 pct of the stock.
    The 1986 net loss was on a pro forma basis, Newmont said.
On a historical basis, it added, Magma had a 1986 net loss of
58.1 mln dlrs on a loss from operations of 42.3 mln dlrs.
    On Dec 31, 1986, Newmont said, Magma had about 85.0 mln
dlrs of net operating loss carryforwards expiring in 1999-2000
and about 4.0 mln dlrs of investment tax credit carryover
expiring in 2000-2001.
    Newmont said Magma has pre-tax losses of 290 mln dlrs
during the 1981 through 1985 period, noting the five major U.S.
primary copper producers reported aggregate pre-tax losses of
1.9 billion dlrs during five year period.
    Newmont said Magma had total sales of 347.3 mln dlrs last
year, including copper sales of 293.4 mln dlrs.
    It said the copper sales value was up from 267.6 mln dlrs
in 1985 reflecting a 10.1 pct increase in quantity sold to
212,000 short tons and a 0.4 pct decrease in price.

<TITLE>SEC REMOVES OBSTACLE TO FOREIGN FUTURES TRADING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Securities and Exchange
Commission removed a key regulatory obstacle to trading futures
on designated foreign debt securities on U.S. exchanges.
    The move would allow the Chicago Board of Trade, CBT, to
apply to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, for
approval of a futures contract on yen bonds.
    The CBT has said it may apply for approval of the yen bond
futures contract, a CFTC spokesman said.
    The SEC's action, which was approved by a 4-0 vote,
specifically removes a regulation against trading futures on
designated foreign government debt securities on contract
markets that are not located in the country that issued those
securities.
    Futures on the government debt securities of Japan, Canada
and Great Britain can already be marketed in the United States
under a designated exemption issued by the SEC.
    But the new move would permit U.S. exchanges to apply to
the CFTC for approval of establishing futures contracts on
those securities, SEC officials said.
    The new SEC move would also allow those foreign government
debt securities to be marketed in the United States by
countries other than those that issued the securities, the
officials said.
    Since the foreign government securities underlying the
futures cannot be traded in the United States unless they are
registered with the SEC, settlement and delivery of the futures
would often take place in the foreign country, the SEC
officials said.
    The SEC is also considering expanding futures trading of
additional countries' government securities to be marketed and
traded in the United States, the officials said.

<TITLE>GERMAN BANKS SAY UNCERTAINTY ABOUT ECONOMY GROWING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Uncertainty is growing about the prospects
for the economy as orders for industry fall and companies scale
back investment plans, the German Savings Banks and Giro
Association said.
    Exporters expect foreign demand to remain weak, while
industry is less optimistic than it was, the association said
in a report.
    However, last month's agreement among the six leading
western industrialized countries to keep currencies around
present levels was expected to be a stabilizing influence for
exporters, it added.
    The banking association said the possibility of using
monetary policy to stimulate the economy should not be
overestimated.
    Another small drop in already low interest rates could not
be expected to cause any significant rise in purchases of
consumer or capital goods, it said.
    The Bundesbank's half-point cuts in the discount and
Lombard rates in January have largely exhausted the scope for
any further monetary moves, the association added.
    On Tuesday the Federal Statistics Office said gross
national product stagnated in real, seasonally and calendar
adjusted terms in the fourth quarter of 1986 compared with the
third quarter.
    The Economics Ministry, commenting on the figures, said GNP
in the 1987 first quarter was also expected to be relatively
weak.
    Bank economists have forecast the economy will either
stagnate or contract slightly in the first quarter. Official
first-quarter figures are due in early June.

<TITLE>INVESTORS TO RAISE CYCLOPS &lt;CYL> TENDER PRICE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DAYTON, Ohio, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cyacq Corp, an investor group
bidding for Cyclops Corp, said it would raise its outstanding
tender offer price for Cyclops common to 92.50 dlrs a share
from 80 dlrs, if certain conditions were met.
    The increased offer would exceed the 90.25 dlrs a share
price offered by Dixons Group PLC in a tender offer for Cyclops
that is part of a definitive agreement to acquire the
Pittsburgh-based maker of carbon tool and specialty steel
products.
    Cyacq includes Audio/Video Affiliates Inc and Citicorp
Capital Investors Ltd and other investors.
    Cyclops has about 4.1 mln shares outstanding.
    For the tender price to be raised, Cyclops must provide
Cyacq with all non-public information provided to Dixons Group
and Cyacq must be satisfied with financial projections made in
offering material by Dixons based on the information, Cyacq
said.
    Additionally, Dixon Group's rights to buy Cyclops common
and its rights to fees or expenses if the Dixon-Cyclop merger
agreement is broken must be rescinded, Cyacq said.
    Cyacq said financial projections it developed for Cyclops
were materially lower than the financial projections provided
by Cyclops to Dixons Group.
    A Cyclops spokeswoman said the company had no details of
the new Cyacq proposal and could not comment. "We have nothing
in hand," she said.
    In addition to making specialty metal products, Cyclops
also operates about 115 specialty stores that sell consumer
electronics products. The stores are located in 17 states
concentrated in the Northeast, Northwest and Southwest.
    Cyclops employs about 8,900 people in Pennsylvania, Ohio
and other states. It also has interests in non-residential
construction.
    In 1986, Cyclops earned 21.3 mln dlrs or 5.26 dlrs a share
on sales of 1.5 billion dlrs, compared to 1985 earnings of 26.2
mln dlrs or 6.20 dlrs on sales of 1.4 billion, the spokeswoman
said.
    The agreement with Dixons Group calls for Cyclops's steel
and construction businesses to be sold to a unit of Alleghany
Corp &lt;Y> for about 110 mln dlrs once the merger is completed.
    A Cyacq spokesman said the new conditional tender price
would be all cash. He had no comment on whether Cyacq plans to
withdraw its current offer, which is scheduled to expire
midnight on March six.
    Dixon Group's offer extends to March 17.

<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Security Pacific Corp said it
completed its previously announced acquisition of Orbanco
Financial Services Corp after receiving federal approval of the
deal.
    Security Pacific said the Federal Reserve Board approved on

    The purchase of Orbanco, for about 47 mln dlrs in cash and
common stock, will be effective in 30 days, a Security Pacific

    Terms call for each share of Orbanco common stock to be
exchanged for about 14 dlrs of Security Pacific common stock,
plus 1.50 dlrs cash.
    Each share of Orbanco's 100-dlr par value preferred stock
will be exchanged for 100 dlrs cash, plus accrued dividends.
    Orbanco, with one billion dlrs in assests, is the holding
company for the Oregon Bank, Orbanco Real Estate Service Co,
American Data Service Inc and Orbanco Securities Corp.
    Security Pacific now has four major regional bank purchases
outside California completed or pending.

four billion dlrs, in the fourth quarter of 1986.
    Pending approval currently is the purchase of Rainier
Bancorporation &lt;RBAN>, with assets of 9.2 billion dlrs. In
anticipation of legislative changes that take effect in 1989,
Security Pacific has also negotiated the future purchase of The

<TITLE>U.S. TO ASK FOR SHARE OF JAPAN'S RICE MARKET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng said he will ask Japan to offer a share of its rice market
to U.S. exporters when he visits that country next month.
    In an interview with Reuters, Lyng also said the Reagan
administration will ask Tokyo to remove its quotas on U.S. beef
and citrus exports.
    Lyng, who plans to be in Japan April 14-27, said he will
not ask Tokyo to liberalize fully its rice market. "We will urge
that they consider sharing their rice market," he said.
    The USDA secretary would not say how big a share of the
Japanese rice market the U.S. would request. "We've got none of
it now. If we got one per cent of it, it would be a big
improvement," he said.
    Last year, the Reagan administration rejected a petition by
the U.S. rice industry seeking relief from Japanese import
restrictions.
    However, the U.S. said it would reexamine the issue if by
mid-1987 Japan did not roll back import barriers to U.S. rice
exports.
    Lyng said he would not be conducting formal negotiations
next month with Japan over their beef and citrus quotas, but
that his visit "may be a forerunner in a general way" to talks
prior to expiration of the bilateral agreement in March 1988.
    He said, however, that the U.S. "will ask for a definite
liberalization of those items (beef and citrus).... When you
translate 'liberalization' into Japanese, it means do away with
the quota."

<TITLE>UNION PACIFIC &lt;UNP> TO SELL PART OF REFINERY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Union Pacific Corp said it will sign a
pact in Caracas on March 17 with Petroleos De Venezuela, PDVSA,
to sell the state owned company half of its Corpus Christi,
Texas refinery owned by its Union Pacific's Champlin Petroleum
Co subsidiary.
    The sale will also include the related marketing and
distribution system for the refinery's products.
    A spokesman for the company said that a statement may be
issued later today giving details of the transaction.
    There was no immediate comment from PDVSA officials in New
York.
    The Corpus Christi refinery has a capacity of about 160,000
barrels per day, the Union Pacific spokesman said, and is a
largely upgraded facility but he would place no value on the
transaction.
    The additional acquisition of refinery and distribution
assets by PDVSA has been expected as Venezuela has been moving
aggressively to enhance its role in the oil industry from
producer to excpanding its presence in the downstream sector.
    Purchase of part of Champlin's operations also fits a
profile which PDVSA officials have said previously they looked
for in any acquisition.
    One PDVSA official said the company was looking for
independent oil companies with good refinery and distribution
network and a strong regional presence.
    The potential purchase of the interest in Champlin followed
its earlier acquisition of a part interest in Southland Corp's
&lt;SLC> Citgo Petroleum Corp subsidiary.
    In that agreement signed September 15, 1986, PDVSA paid
Southland 290 mln dlrs for half of Citgo's stock.
    The potetnital acquisition of half Champlin's Corpus
Christi plant will also give Venezuela an additional outlet for
its crude oil production while giving the refiner an assured
source of supply, trade sources said.
    In the earlier deal with Southland, PDVSA agredd to to
supply Citgo with at least 130,000 bpd of crude oil and other
feedstocks.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poor's Corp said it
downgraded Canada's Province of Saskatchewan. The action
affects the equivalent of 1.68 billion U.S. dlrs of debt.
    S and P lowered the province's long-term debt to AA-minus
from AA.
    The rating agency said the action reflected a substantial
increase in Saskatchewan's budget deficit for fiscal 1987 and
prospects for greater tax-supported debt in the medium term.
    S and P pointed out that the outlook for future revenue
growth is constrained by general weakness in the province's
commodity-based economy because of low prices.

    The seven-year bonds totalling 500 mln forints may be taken

    The interest rate will always be 0.5 points above that
charged to commercial banks by the National Bank of Hungary for

    The funds raised will be used to increase the bank's

<TITLE>WILDLIFE UNIT PROPOSES ALASKA REFUGE OIL STUDY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>The National Wildlife Federation 
rejected an Interior Department draft plan to open wilderness
lands in Northern Alaska to oil and gas exploration.
    The federation, the nation's largest conservation group,
said further study was needed to assess any possible damage
that development might have on the wildlife in the area, the
coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
    Jay Hair, the federation's executive vice president, called
the Interior's research into the effects of development "so
fundamentally flawed that it provides little or no basis on
which to make a public policy decision."
    Hair called the department's proposal a "reflection of a
largely political decision," adding "we have no confidence in
Interior to represent the broad public interest in this area."
    Interior wants to open the 1.5 million acre coastal plain
to oil and gas exploration, but it said only with tough 
safeguards to protect the area's caribou and musk-oxen.
    It said a preliminary survey showed the region could hold
billions of barrels of oil and gas, and that its potential as
an energy resource would never be known without exploration.
    Interior said oil on the coastal plain could match the 10
billion barrels found at Prudhoe Bay, just west of the plain.
    Under existing law, Congress must agree to oil and gas
exploration, and if it does not act, the land will remain a
wildlife refuge protected from commercial development.
    Hair said Interior's report failed to stress the
probability that finding recoverable oil is only 19 pct.
    He said Interior's study also failed to weigh oil, gas,
fish and wildlife information the State of Alaska had gathered
nor had the department consulted the Environmental Protection
Agency on the possible effects of exploration.
    The federation, in letters to Congressmen, proposed that a
nine-member commission be set up to study all aspects of the
issue and report back to Congress in about two years.
    Hair said the federation was not opposed to the possible
exploration of oil, only that Interior's study was inadquate to
make a sound judgement.
    Congressional observers said that at present there was
little sentiment in Congress to open the wildlife area for
commercial exploitation dispite increasing concern that the
United States is becoming overly dependent on foreign oil.

<TITLE>FRN MARKET SLUMPS, FIXED RATE EUROBOND TRADE QUIET</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Dominique Jackson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Eurobond prices in the floating rate
note sector slumped across the board by as much as a full point
on some issues.
    "Today has been irrational, irresponsible -- possibly the
worst day in what has been a dire six months for the floater
market," commented a senior FRN trader at a U.K. Bank.
    Republic of Ireland FRNs were marked sharply down in
initial trading and market nerves soon infected other
supra-national and sovereign paper with dealers attributing the
falls to aggressive professional shorting by a few leading U.S.
Investment houses.
    The FRN market has been suffering from acute contraction of
liquidity and consequent drain of investor confidence since the
effective collapse in the market for perpetual floating rate
issues late last year.
    Since then, FRN specialists noted that retail interest has
been sparse or completely absent and the stagnant market for
floating rate paper has become increasingly vulnerable to
manipulation, with nerves affecting all variety of borrowers.
    Floating rate debt of U.S. And Canadian banks came under
pressure last month when fears resurfaced about their exposure
to Latin American debt. Canadian banks were hard hit today.
    Fears about the Irish economy, exacerbated by recent
post-electoral political wrangling in Dublin, prompted a
sell-off of Ireland paper this morning with both dollar and
mark-denominated Irish issues tumbling by a full point or more.
    However, FRN dealers polled by Reuters felt the Irish
issues had been singled out -- as the U.S. And Canadian banks
were most recently -- as the market's most vulnerable sector.
    "A handful of professional houses are targetting the weak
paper, shorting it aggressively and this is just starting the
domino effect with basically sound paper also starting to roll
with it," a senior FRN market source explained.
    Although floating paper from better-regarded borrowers such
as the U.K. Managed to finish the day only around 10 basis
points down, other sovereigns like Sweden and supranationals
like Eurofima suffered heavier losses, FRN dealers said.
    Debt exposure fears continued to undermine U.S. And
Canadian bank paper with one U.K. House citing a fall of 1-5/8
point on the day on a Royal Bank of Canada issue.
    FRN traders noted Japanese investors, initially
enthusiastic floating rate debt buyers, had lost confidence in
the market and speculated that a crisis meeting, such as the
one called upon the collapse of the perpetuals, could be
imminent.
    "Retail clients just don't want to know about the floaters
any more so it has degenerated to a wily pass-the-parcel among
the professionals, all scheming to sweep the paper under the
carpet," another senior FRN trader said.
    "I don't know what is going to happen to the market. It
can't go on like this," he added.
    In the fixed-rate sector, trading was dull with the market
still attempting to digest a heavy volume of new issues from
earlier this week although primary market activity slowed
somewhat today, trading and syndicate sources reported.
    Dollar straight bonds ended the day barely changed from
opening levels as investors failed to react on the unexpectedly
large 4.1 pct rise in U.S. February retail sales, prefering to
wait for tomorrow's producer price and business inventory data.
    A 100 mln dlr deal for Norsk Hydro was launched later in
the day and the issue was trading around its total two pct fees
at close of grey market trade although dealers said the
borrower's frequent appearance in the euromarkets could deter
investors.
    The Canadian dollar sector however saw good two-way trade
and a continuation of recent healthy volume as the Canadian
dollar rides high on the foreign exchanges and futures markets.
    Dealers said the strength of the Canadian dollar, which has
firmed especially over the last two days, has renewed end
investors confidence in the currency.
    A new Canadian dollar issue for Hydro Quebec was seeing
excellent demand, sector specialists said, and the issue was
quickly increased to a total of 150 mln dlrs from 125 mln.
    "This kind of paper can be hard to sell and it is gratifying
to see such a high level of interest, both European and
domestic Canadian demand," commented one trader at a Canadian
house.
    Eurosterling, which has been in the limelight lately, also
on foreign exchange and currency bullishness, slipped slightly.
    Senior eurosterling sources noted that bond prices fell
back today, more or less in line with losses seen on the U.K.
Government bond market -- around 5/8 point lower at the longer
end of the eurosterling market.
    Dealers said overseas investors had not been buying today
and predicted consolidation before next week's U.K. Budget. A
55 mln stg convertible issue for confectioners Rowntree
Mackintosh was well bid at 104-5/8 105-1/8 pct and expected to
go well.
    Euroyen bonds showed a firmer tone led by some professional
short covering from Tokyo. Today's 23 billion deal for Toyota
Motor Credit with a 4-1/2 pct coupon was deemed tight however.

<TITLE>LYNG SAYS NO DECISION ON SOVIET EEP OFFER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng said the Reagan administration had not decided on offering
the Soviet Union subsidized wheat but that such an offer had
not been ruled out.
    In an interview with Reuters, Lyng also said that he had no
knowledge of any upcoming discussion of the matter within the
cabinet.
    Asked if the administration had ruled out offering to
subsidize wheat exports to the Soviet Union under the
department's export enhancement program, Lyng said, "No. We
haven't made a decision on it, haven't even talked about it,
haven't even looked at it."
    Reminded that there have been reports that Moscow would buy
U.S. wheat if competitively priced, Lyng responded, "If they
(the Soviets) would offer to buy some wheat, would we accept
it? It would depend on what price they offered."
    Lyng added that he did not think the price of U.S. wheat
was far off the world price.
    Asked about persistent speculation that the administration
would offer Moscow a wheat subsidy, Lyng said, "Some people
think they're doing it to see if they can get a little spurt in
the market."
    Agriculture Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz last week asked
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to investigate reports
that wheat prices were being manipulated by reports that a U.S.
wheat subsidy offer was imminent.

<TITLE>NORD EST PLANS 400 MLN FRANC BOND ISSUE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Financial and industrial holding company
Nord Est plans to make a convertible bond issue for a total of
400 mln francs, President Gustave Rambaud said.
    He told a news conference Nord-Est expected to receive
approval from the Bourse supervisory body COB in the next two
week, when terms would set according to market conditions.
    He said the issue was meant to boost capital ahead of new
investments.
    Rambaud said the company would pay a 1986 dividend of 5.25
francs, unchanged on 1985. Parent company net profit last year
rose to 99.5 mln francs against 71.1 mln in 1985.
    Provisional consolidated profits were lower at 185 mln
francs compared with 200 mln in 1985, of which 120 mln, against
147 mln, was attributable to the group. He said the lower
profit was mainly due to losses made by steel-tube maker
Vallourec, in which Nord Est has a 12.5 pct stake.
    Rambaud said he forecast a 1987 parent company net profit
before provisions of around 135 mln francs.

<DATELINE>    ALBUQUERQUE, N.M., March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Solv-Ex Corp said it
successfully completed its oil sands pilot testing program
under its agreement with Shell Canada Limited &lt;SHC> and
received a 250,000 U.S. dlr bonus payment.
    It also said that Shell Canada exercised its option to take
over Solv-Ex's 25 pct working interest in the construction of
the oil facility, relieving it of its obligation to raise about
62.5 mln Canadian dlrs for plant construction.
    It said 30 pct of that loan was guaranteed by the
Government of Alberta.
    In exchange for Shell's participation, Solv-Ex said Shell
is obligated to pay it an up-front royalty and a running
royalty based on the operating profits of the oil sands
facility. It said the Shell Canada 7,500 barrel per day oil
sands project will be built on Shell's oil sand lease about 40
miles north of Fort McMurray in the Athabasca region of
northern Alberta.
    Solv-Ex said the project will cost about 260 mln Canadian
dlrs. It said that following a final feasibility study the
plant should open in the early 1990s when oil prices are
expected to exceed 20 U.S. dlrs per barrel.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, MARCH 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Union Pacific Corp said it will enter
a 50-50 partnership with Petroles de Venezuela, PDVSA, to own
and operate Union Pacific's 160,000 barrel-per-day Corpus
Christi, Texas, oil refinery.
    The assests to be acquired by the partnership are valued at
190 mln dlrs, Union Pacific said.
    Closing is expected to take place in early April and the
venture is to be called Champlin Refining Co.
    The partnership will acquire the refining and distribution
systems currently owned and operated by Champlin Petroleum, a
wholly owned subsidiary of Union Pacific.
    The venture will acquire the related inventories and the
Champlin trade name, the company said.
    PDVSA and Union Pacific will each contribute half the
capital required by the venture and arrange a revolving credit
facility with U.S. and foreign banks to finance inventories and
receivables, Union Pacific said.
    Petroles de Venezuela also signed a 25-year agreement to
supply at least 140,000 bpd of Venezulean crude oil and naphtha
to the refinery at market related prices.
    Under various options the in the agreement PDVSA could
supply another 50,000 bpd on similar terms, the company said.
    "This will provide a stable, long-term supply to the
refinery at competitive costs, thereby assuring the economic
viability of the plant," a statement issued by Union Pacific
said.
   The statement said the agreement with PDVSA will enable the
company to supply a steady flow of refined products to its
customers.
   Union Pacific said employees of the refinery would be
transfered to the new company and would retain the same
benefits as in the past.

<TITLE>PUROLATOR &lt;PCC> DIRECTOR QUITS OVER BUYOUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>A Purolator Courier Corp director
resigned from the company's board, saying he plans to take
steps to make or find an offer that tops the 265 mln dlr buyout
deal already accepted by Purolator's board, the company said.
    The director, Doresy Gardner, resigned in a March 10 letter
to the Purolator board, which was included in a filing made by
the company to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
    Gardner noted that the terms of the merger agreement in
which the company would bought out by a group of its managers
and E.F. Hutton LBO Inc bar directors from taking action to
solicit, initiate or encourage acquisition proposals.
    "I, as a shareholder, wish to solicit, initiate or
encourage such an offer or indication of interest, and believe,
therefore, that I should resign as a director of the
corporation," Gardner said in the letter.
    "Accordingly, I hereby resign as a director of Purolator
Courier Corp, effective immediately," he said.
    Gardner said he believes shareholders could get a better
deal than the buyout offer if the company would agree to be
sold to some other entity, or if it could sell off all or part
of its U.S. courier division.
    On March 4, another Purolator shareholder, Rodney Shields,
filed a class action suit on behalf of the company's
shareholders charging the company and its board with breaching
their fiduciary duty by failing to take steps to ensure that
shareholders got the highest possible price in the buyout.
    The deal would give shareholders 35 dlrs a share in cash if
just 83 pct of Purolator's 7.6 mln shares are tendered. If more
are tendered, they would receive 29 dlrs in cash and six dlrs
in debentures and a warrant to buy stock in the new company in
exchange for each share.

<TITLE>U.S.-SOVIET GRAIN ACCORD QUESTIONED BY LYNG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng said he was not sure a long-term U.S.-Soviet grain
agreement would be worth extending when it expires next year.
    "It hasn't been worth much in the last two years....They
haven't lived up to the agreement as I see it," Lyng said in an
interview with Reuters.
    "It would be my thought that it's not worth any effort to
work out an agreement with someone who wants the agreement to
be a one-sided thing," he said.
    However, Lyng said he did not want to make a "definitive
commitment one way or another at this point."
    Under the accord covering 1983-88, the Soviets agreed to
buy at least nine mln tonnes of U.S. grain, including four mln
tonnes each of corn and wheat.
    Moscow bought 6.8 mln tonnes of corn and 153,000 tonnes of
wheat during the third agreement year, which ended last
September, and this year has bought one mln tonnes of corn.
    Lyng said he had no knowledge of how much U.S. grain Moscow
would buy this year.
    "I've seen people making comments on that and I don't know
how they know, unless they talk to the Soviets," he said. "I have
no knowledge, and I really don't think anyone other than the
Soviets have any knowledge."
    Lyng said he thought the Soviets bought U.S. corn last
month because "they needed it and because the price was right."
    "Our corn has been pretty reasonably priced. And I think
they've always found that our corn was good," he said.

<TITLE>U.S. SOYBEAN MARKETING LOAN NOT NEEDED - LYNG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng said a marketing loan for soybeans would serve no present
purpose because the U.S. price is not above the world price.
    Asked in an interview if it was time to consider a
marketing loan for soybeans, Lyng said, "I don't think so. I
don't think the world price is lower than our price anyway."
    However, the USDA secretary said that if current conditions
of surplus production persisted, it might be appropriate to
consider a marketing loan.
    "I suppose that under that condition there is a danger our
exports will continue to drop and that the government will
continue to accumulate large stocks of soybeans," he said. "It
might be (worth contemplating a marketing loan), if there were
a world market that was lower than our market."

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>RUBBER TALKS CHAIRMAN CITES SLIGHT PROGRESS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GENEVA, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>There has been slight progress towards
reaching a rubber pact, the chairman of a United Nations
conference on a new International Natural Rubber Agreeement,
INRA, Manaspas Xuto of Thailand, said.
    "There has been some slight progress but it is not the end
of the road yet," he said.
    The conference, which began Monday, is seen as the last
effort to adopt an accord to replace the current one which
expires in October. Some 40 producing and consuming countries
are taking part in the two-week meeting.
    Xuto said if the key outstanding issues are not resolved by
tomorrow he would hold weekend meetings.
    At the beginning of the conference, the fourth such meeting
in nearly two years, Xuto said it was imperative to settle
those issues this week so that technical drafting work can be
done next week.
    Conference sources said it is highly unlikely that
producers will accept a pact that will provide for any possible
downward adjustment of the floor price, as proposed by
consumers under certain circumstances.
    The sources said this means that any possible adjustment
would centre on the reference price, and the "may buy" (or "may
sell") and "must buy" (or "must sell") levels without changing the
"lower indicative price" (or floor price) of 150
Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilo in the present pact.
    The present five-day average of the indicator price is
around 192 Malaysian/Singapore cents.
    Consumers are seeking an adjustment of the reference price,
set in the current accord at 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents a
kilo, and of the "lower indicative price" if the buffer stock,
currently 360,000 tonnes, rises to 450,000 tonnes.
    Consumers want price reviews at 12-month intervals instead
of the 18 at present, and the price revision mechanism to
respond automatically to market trends.
    At present, if the market price has been above or below the
reference price for six months, the reference price is revised
by five pct or by an amount decided by the International
Natural Rubber Organisation council.
    Consumers say that, in these circumstances, the adjustment
be automatic at five pct or more.
    Producers have resisted reducing the role of the council in
the price adjustment procedure and have expressed concern that
changes proposed by consumers would weaken the present pact.

<TITLE>"BRITANNIA" COIN TO SELL AT PREMIUM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>The new British one ounce gold coin, the
"Britannia," will be priced on the basis of the gold price on the
day of purchase plus a "competitive premium," Treasury officials
said.
    Value added tax will be levied on all purchases by members
of the U.K. Public, as is currently the case with foreign
coins, although transactions between members of the London Gold
Market and all exports of the coins will be zero-rated. No
decision has yet been taken on the face value of the coins.
    Although a number of gold coins, especially the Canadian
Maple, have been issued elsewhere in an attempt to take the
place of the South African krugerrand, the British government
still feels that there is a gap in the market for a British one
ounce gold coin. The only British gold coin available at
present is the sovereign, which contains 0.2354 ounces of gold.
    Gold from South Africa or the Soviet Union will not be used
in the coin, officials said, adding that bullion would be
bought on the world gold market. But analysts said it would be
difficult to ascertain the origins of such purchases.
    No details are yet available on how many coins will be
issued or how much gold will be bought, but traders said that
the amounts involved would be unlikely to move the gold price.
    There were some enquiries on the "Britannia" from coin
dealers today, but value added tax would prove a major factor
in the success of the coin, with the 15 pct tax likely to put
off many investors, traders said.
    Some said that the "Britannia" had come too late, with the
Canadian Maple Leaf, the American Eagle and other gold coins
already well established.

<TITLE>MONTEDISON, OTHER REFINERIES TO SHUT FOR WORK</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By JO WINTERBOTTOM, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Selm-Societa Energia Montedison is to
close its Priolo crude refining units from March 15th to March
28th for maintenance, a company spokesman said.
    Throughput at the refinery is currently estimated at
140-150,000 bpd, although total capacity is nearer 200,000 bpd.
    Several other Mediterranean refineries are currently
shutdown for maintenance, most of which were scheduled some
months ago. But industry sources said that shutdowns may have
been rearranged to avoid running negative-netback crude.
     Tighter availabilities of products as a result of the 
shutdowns in the Med is helping to keep products markets
bullish, particularly for March deliveries, oil traders said.
    Garrone's refinery at San Quirico (capacity 130,000 bpd) is
due to shutdown on March 14th for three weeks, and the
jointly-owned ISAB/Garrone refinery at Mellili, capacity
220,000 bpd, is due to start up around March 20-25th following
its closure for maintenance a month ago, a company spokesman
said.
    The Esso Italiana refineries at Augusta and Siracusa will
not be closing this spring, a spokesman for the company said.
    In France, the distillation unit at Societe Francaise de
BP's Lavera refinery has been closed for maintenance since
March 2, and is due to restart early April. Total capacity is
181,900 bpd. It is currently operating at around 50 pct
capacity, a company spokesman said.
    Shell Francaise's Berre l'Etang refinery will shut down in
early April until mid-June, a company spokesman said. Capacity
is around 150,000 bpd. Compagnie Francaise de Raffinage (CFR)
will close the visbreaker at its La Mede refinery in early
April, but would not affect crude throughput at the refinery, a
company spokesman said. Current capacity is 136,000 bbl/day.
    Despite current bullish sentiment in the Med, however,
traders noted that crude netbacks are beginning to look more
attractive, and most maintenance shutdowns should be finished
in two to three weeks.
    As a result, oil industry sources suggest that the
situation may ease by mid-April.

<TITLE>FIRST INTERSTATE &lt;I> DEBT DOWNGRADED BY S/P</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poor's Corp said it
downgraded First Interstate Bancorp's 1.3 billion dlrs of debt
because of higher levels of non-performing assets.
    S and P also cited net charge-offs, especially in real
estate, energy and consumer loans. However, the agency said
First Interstate has high liquidity and is less vulnerable to
Latin American credits than its peers.
    Cut were the company's senior debt to AA-minus from AA and
subordinated debt to A-plus from AA-minus. Long-term deposits
of several of the parent's banks were reduced to AA-minus from
AA but short-term deposit ratings were left at A-1-plus.

<TITLE>W.R. GRACE &lt;GRA> DEBT AFFIRMED BY S/P</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poor's Corp said it
affirmed the ratings on W.R. Grace and Co's 575 mln dlrs of
debt following its fourth-quarter 1986 loss of 560 mln dlrs.
    Affirmed were the company's BBB-minus senior debt, BB-plus
subordinated debt and A-3 commercial paper.
    S and P pointed out that the fourth-quarter loss resulted
from the write-off of nearly 600 mln dlrs in assets, especially
in agricultural chemicals and natural resources.
    Because that write-off had no effect on Grace's cash, S and
P affirmed the current ratings, noting that Grace intends to
sell its agricultural business.
    Proceeds from the sale of the agricultural segment could be
used to reduce Grace's debt, Standard and Poor's said.
    However, S and P said it is less clear whether Grace can
also extricate itself from the project debt from its phosphate
mining joint venture at Four Corners.
    Despite today's rating affirmation, S and P cautioned that
Grace has greater-than-usual vulnerability to rating change in
the next year or two.
    "Uncertainty abounds as to the firm's future ownership,
management and direction," the rating agency said.

<TITLE>ATTACKS AFFECT COLOMBIA'S OIL OUTLOOK-ECOPETROL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOGOTA, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Continuous rebel raids against oil
pipelines and foreign exploration camps endanger Colombia's
present oil bonanza, Franciso Chona, manager of the state-run
oil company Ecopetrol said.
    "It seems the subversion wants to end with our oil bonanza,"
he told reporters.
    He was speaking after a meeting with Defense Minister
Rafael Samudio, military chiefs and Mines and Energy Minister
Guillermo Perry to review the security situation in the light
of a recent upsurge of leftist guerrilla attacks in the
oil-rich Arauca region, bordering Venezuela.
    Ecopetrol chief of security, Retired General Carlos
Narvaez, said security measures would be stricter and that the
armed forces were closely collaborating but gave no details.
    Samudio said new plans had been designed and hoped they
would be effective. Samudio stressed that, despite the most
recent attacks, which cost more than four mln dlrs in damage,
the overall situation had improved compared with last December
when initial measures were taken to combat a wave of attacks.
    Repeated bombings of a vital pipeline from the Cano Limon
oilfield to the Caribbean then led to a loss of 51,000 barrels
of crude.

<TITLE>RESORTS INTL &lt;RT.A> DEBT RATINGS AFFIRMED BY S/P</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poor's Corp said it
affirmed the ratings on 600 mln dlrs of debt of Resorts
International Inc and Resorts International Financing Inc.
    Developer Donald Trump has agreed to pay 101 mln dlrs for
all of Resorts International's class B shares, representing 93
pct voting control, S and P noted. Trump said he would not
tender for the 5.7 mln shares of publicly held class A stock.
    The agreement is subject to approval by the New Jersey
Casino Control Commission. S and P pointed out that Resorts'
aggressive debt leverage is offset by the firm's extensive real
estate holdings in Atlantic City, N.J.
    Affirmed were the B-minus subordinated debt of Resorts
International and its financing unit.
    Standard and Poor's noted that Resorts International
remains highly leveraged, with significant near-term financing
requirements for the completion of its new casino/hotel in
Atlantic City, the Taj Mahal.
    While operations are profitable, the interest burden of
debt, along with unusual charges, net of gains, led to a 30.6
mln dlr net loss in 1986, S and P pointed out.
    Longer-term, Resorts is expected to benefit from a
strengthened competitive position, S and P added.

<TITLE>PERU'S CENTROMIN SAYS NO COPPER FORCE MAJEURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LIMA, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Peru's biggest state mining firm,
Centromin SA, said today there was no immediate force majeure
possibility on its copper shipments after guerrillas blew up a
railway line, interrupting train traffic from the Cobriza
copper mine to the Pacific coast.
    A Centromin spokesman said the managers of the mine at
Cobriza could always ship the the mineral by road to the coast
for export if the train line continued interrupted. Cobriza
produced the equivalent of around 40,600 fine tonnes of copper
last year.
    Maoist guerrillas using dynamite interrupted train traffic
two days ago when they blew up railway tracks and derailed a
train laden with minerals 225 km (135 miles) east of Lima at
Chacapalca, between the coast and Cobriza.
    An official at Minero Peru Comercial, Minpeco, Peru's state
minerals marketing firm, confirmed there had been no
declaration of force majeure on the shipments from Cobriza.
    Officials at National Train Company, Enafer, headquarters
in Lima, the Peruvian capital, declined to comment on when
train traffic would be restored to Cobriza.
    But an Enafer official, reached by telephone in the central
Andean city of Huancayo, near Chacapalca, said traffic could be
restored by Saturday.

<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Minister of State for Finance Tom Hockin
said he has asked the Canadian Bankers Association, an industry
lobby group, for an explanation of the level of credit card
interest rates.
    Hockin said he hopes to here the association's response on
the "important" issue soon. Hockin was responding to questions
in the House of Commons about why credit card rates, which run
as high as 28 pct per year, remain high when other rates are
falling.
    Today, the Canadian bank rate fell to 7.28 pct from 7.54
pct last week and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce cut
its prime rate, effective tomorrow, to 8.75 pct from 9.25 pct.

<DATELINE>    PITTSBURGH, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Alleghney International Inc said the
plaintiffs in the existing lawsuits opposing its sale requested
an amendment to their complaint to include a class action
count.
    Alleghney said the suit, filed in the U.S. District Court
for the Western District of Pennsylvania, was aimed at blocking
the sale of Alleghney to an affiliate of First Boston Inc.
    Allegheney said the additional count sought by the
plaintiffs alleges the price to be offered for AI's common
stock, 24.60 dlrs, is grossly unfair and one the purposes of
the proposed sale is to absolve the individual defendants of
liability in the lawsuit.
     The additional count among other forms of relief, requests
an injunction against the defendants from taking any steps to
accomplish the proposed sale, Alleghney said.

<TITLE>PESSIMISM MOUNTS OVER BAHIAN TEMPORAO COCOA CROP</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Richard Jarvie, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pessimism over the effects of a
prolonged dry spell on the coming Bahian temporao cocoa crop is
rising with trade forecasts generally in the 2.0 mln to 2.5 mln
bag range against 2.5 mln to 3.0 mln a fortnight ago.
    Trade sources told Reuters from the state capital of
Salvador that despite scattered rains since mid-February, which
broke a six week drought, plantations have not picked up as
hoped and very little cocoa is expected to be gathered in the
first three months of the May/September crop.
    The sources said arrivals from May through July might only
reach around 600,000 bags whereas in normal years a figure of
1.0 mln to 1.5 mln bags might be expected.
    Arrivals from then should start to pick up sharply as pods
from current flowering are gathered. However, the sources noted
a late temporao is always more susceptible to pod rot, which
flourishes if conditions turn cold and humid, and which is more
likely from late July on.
    This year's crop is doubly susceptible because poor prices
mean farmers were not encouraged to invest in fertilisers and
insecticides and are also unlikely to treat against pod rot.
    A severe attack of pod rot can cause the loss of over
500,000 bags in a very short period, one source said.
    Because of the increased exposure to pod rot damage,
estimates of the final outcome of the temporao are extremely
vulnerable and production could easily drop to below the 2.0
mln bag mark if the disease hits.
    Although flowering was good following the start of the
rains, pod setting was not up to expectations, possibly because
the drought had caused a drop in the insect population which
pollinates flowers, the sources said.
    However, reports from farms indicate moisture levels are
now generally back to near normal levels and that current
flowering and pod setting is good, which should result in
mature fruit from August through September.
    The sources said they expect no break in the harvesting of
beans between the end of the temporao and the beginning of the
main crop, which officially starts on October 1.
    "The cut-off date is completely artificial. If things go
well from now on we should see heavy harvesting without a break
from August through November or even December," one said.
    If predictions of a 2.0 to 2.5 mln bag temporao prove
accurate this would be below the 2.7 mln bag average for the
past 10 years. The last poor temporao was in 1984 when
prolonged drought and later pod rot cut production to 1.79 mln
bags, the lowest since 1974.
    Good growing conditions the following year produced a
temporao of 3.12 mln bags, just below the 1983 3.17 mln bag
record, while last year's output, which also suffered some
drought damage, was 2.77 mln bags.
    Figures for the coming temporao might be distorted upwards
by the inclusion of undeclared current main crop beans.
    The sources said large quantities of beans are believed to
have been undeclared from this year's record total harvest and
they were unsure how much of this would be unregistered by the
end of the official crop year on April 30.
    Recent official arrivals figures have been swollen by the
inclusion of beans which had been delivered previously to port
warehouses but not declared.
    Because of the high turnover of beans this year,
significant amounts have deteriorated because they were stored
too long at the back of warehouses. Some of these are expected
to be held for mixing in with early temporao arrivals.
    With official arrivals figures for the 1986/87 temporao and
main crops totalling over 6.1 mln bags, and over seven weeks
still to go to the end of the year, the total outturn should be
at least a record 6.5 mln bags if all production is declared,
the sources said.
    This would compare with the previous record set last year
of 6.03 mln.
    However, there is no way of telling how many current crop
beans will be declared after the May 1 start of the temporao
and thus the true size of the 1986/87 harvest may never be
officially registered.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>TALKING POINT/PUROLATOR COURIER CORP &lt;PCC></TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Patti Domm, Reuter</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    New York, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Purolator Courier corp's stock rose on
specualtion that a disgruntled former Purolator director would
find a new suitor for the company, traders said.
    Purolator agreed in late February to a 35 dlr-a-share, 265
mln-dlr offer from E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain members of
its Purolator courier division's management.
    The stock today hit 36-1/4, up one.
    Today, Purolator revealed in a filing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission that director Doresy Gardner resigned
from its board of directors in a letter dated March 10.
    The letter from Gardner said he resigned the board because
the merger agreement with Hutton barred directors from
soliciting new offers and he believes shareholders might get a
better deal. Gardner said he believes a better offer might be
found if the company would agree to be sold to some other
entity, or if it could sell off all or part of its U.S. courier
division.
    "Basically, (the courier division) is a company that has
450 mln dlrs in revenues. It's a very large company and it's
being sold for 50 or 60 mln dlrs," said Gardner in a telephone
interview with Reuters.
    Gardner is an official of Kelso Management, a firm
associated with Fidelity International Ltd. A group of Fidelity
companies owns eight pct of Purolator, and Gardner said he
personally owns 20,000 shares.
    A Purolator official said the company has no comment on the
letter from Gardner.
    Arbitragers speculated another overnight messenger service
may emerge as a likely bidder for Purolator. Before the
transaction with Hutton LBO was announced, analysts had also
speculated another courier company would be the most likely
suitor.
    While one arbitrager acknowledged there in fact may be no
new bidders, he said the possibility one could appear pushed
the stock into play again.
    "There's no shortage of possibilities. It's just a question
of management's willingness to let the process continue," said
one arbitrager.
    Arbitragers said a new buyer might be found because they
believe Hutton LBO has taken on no risk in the transaction.
Hutton has begun a tender for 83 pct of Purolator at 35 dlrs
cash per share. The balance of Purolator's stock will be bought
for securities and warrants in a new company holding the U.S.
courier operations.
    The arbitragers said tender offer documents show that
Hutton does not need to use its cash in the transaction and
will emerge with a giant, majority equity interest in
Purolator.
    "As far as I can tell from the public documents from the
deal that's on the table, Hutton is basically putting up zero.
One always likes a situation like that. You always like to
think if they can do this deal at no risk, there should be
someone else in the world that could do it higher," said one
arbitrager.
    The firm, however, is supplying temporary financing, and
sources close to the transaction disputed the claim that the
firm will not end up paying for its equity position.
    While one scenario mentioned in the tender offer document
did note that the E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary may not have to
keep cash in the transaction, the sources said there is some
risk to the firm.
    "There are a variety of contingencies and restricted cash,
and all sorts of things that make it very speculative," said
one of the sources, adding there are also severance payments to
employees.
    The E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary is supplying 279 mln dlrs
in so-called "bridge" financing for the transaction. The bridge
financing is a temporary loan from Hutton.
    The financing is to be replaced with permanent financing,
expected to come from banks. However, it may take some time to
replace the financing, the source said, resulting in what could
be a substantial expense to the firm.
    Gardner said Hutton stands to gain fees of 10 to 20 mln
dlrs from the transaction, but sources close to the transaction
said fees are at the low end of the scale.
    "It's a very complex transaction, but basically what
happens is they ostensibly put up money but the fees recapture
any investment they might have once the merger takes place,"
Gardner said.

    The wheat, consisting of 60,000 tonnes of hard red winter

1987/88 season, which begins June 1.
    A purchase from a foreign seller is a transaction in which

Semiconductor Corp>, Pentagon officials said.
    "He (Weinberger) opposes it. It is not in the best interests
of the country to have more of the micro-electronics business
leaving the United States," one of the Pentagon officials, who
asked not to be identified, told Reuters.
    Commerce Department officials told Reuters yesterday that
Baldrige opposed the planned sale and that the White House
Economic Policy Council will take up the matter within weeks.
    Commerce and defense officials said Baldrige and Weinberger
feared the U.S. military is already leaning too heavily on
foreign electronic support.
    But the Defense Department also said today that Weinberger
and Baldrige differed on the proposed sale of U.S. computer
equipment to Iran.
    The Commerce Department advised the Pentagon recently that
defense objections to two proposed sales -- to an Iranian power
company and the Islamic Republic of Iran News Agency -- were
not valid and the sales of small and medium computers would go
through unless more evidence was presented.

<TITLE>GLICKMAN PUSHES HARD FOR 0/92 FARM PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Implementation of a one-year 0/92
pilot program for wheat and feedgrains was strongly promoted
today by the chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee
as a way to cut farm costs and simultaneously give farmers
another option when making their planting decisions.
    "We have a budget driven farm policy. It may be a shame,
but we are locked into this," said Dan Glickman, (D-Kans.),
chairman of the subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feed
grains. "We need to look at ways to cut costs and not hurt the
farmer. A 0/92 plan, if properly done, could do both."
    Glickman announced this week plans to introduce a 0/92 bill
for 1987 and 1988 wheat and feedgrains. An aide to Glickman
said that it will probably be introduced next week.
    Glickman said a 0/92 program, which allows a farmer to
forego planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiency
payment, would not be a major revision of the 1985 farm bill --
only an extension of the 50/92 option already provided under
the current bill.
    It is premature to make any major changes in the farm bill,
he said, but if agriculture has to make further cuts to meet
budget goals, a voluntary 0/92 plan would be better than
sharply cutting target prices, as USDA has proposed.
    A 0/92 plan, however, would not be decoupling, but simply a
different type of acreage diversion program, Glickman said.
    Decoupling -- delinking planting decisions from government
payments -- is too much of a policy change to approve at this
point, he said.
    "I don't think there is any interest in pursuing a
decoupling bill this year. Period. Unequivocal," Glickman said
at the hearing.
    Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.), cosponsor of the
Boren/Boschwitz decoupling plan, said he supports a short term
0/92 program as a move to a more permament decoupling plan.
    Boschwitz plans to introduce a 0/92 plan in the senate. His
plan would guarantee a certain deficiency payment to
participating farmers, require that idled acreage be put to
conservation use only, prohibit haying and grazing on extra
idled acreage, limit participation to a certain number of acres
in a county and provide tenant protection provisions.
    "I know we cannot obtain complete decoupling in 1987, but
we can at least move in that direction," Boschwitz said.
    Robbin Johnson, vice president of Cargill, Inc., testified
in favor of decoupling. Decoupling would end the current bias
in U.S. farm policy towards overproduction and reduce farmers'
dependency on the government, he said.
    A 0/92 plan does not go far enough in decoupling, Johnson
said, and would still encourage farmers to plant.
    Officials from the National Corn Growers Association and
the National Cattlemen's Association said their groups oppose
any 0/92 or decoupling plan due to concerns about reopening the
farm bill and creating more confusion among farmers.
    But when asked if his association were forced to choose
between a ten pct cut in target prices or a 0/92 program, Larry
Johnson of the Corn Growers said they would agree to 0/92
rather than take sharp cuts in target levels.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Moody's Investors Service Inc said it
cut to Caa from B-2 Allegheny Beverage Corp's 112 mln dlrs of
subordinated debt.
    The rating agency cited Allegheny's high leverage and poor
operating performance, as well as reduced cash flow.
    Moody's said the company's prospects for improvement are
limited by increasing competition in the food service industry
and decreasing demand for the vending services that Allegheny
provides. Moody's also said a renegotiated bank agreement
includes accelerated amortization requirements that exacerbate
Allegheny's already weakened ability to service its debt.

<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iowa Beef Processors Inc is lifting a
lockout at its Dakota City, Nebraska processing plant and plans
to resume operations March 16, United Food and Commercial
Workers Union spokesman Allen Zack said by phone from his
Washington, D.C. headquarters.
    Iowa Beef, a susbsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corp,
mailed a letter to members of UFCWU Local 222 informing them a
lockout imposed by the company on December 14 would be lifted
and meatpackers could return to work under Iowa Beef's
"revised, last and best final offer," according to Zack.
    The letter was signed by four managers at the Dakota City
plant.
    Iowa Beef closed the proessing plant indefinitely in
mid-December because, it said, it had no alternative to threats
by meatpackers to disrupt operations.
    About 2,800 members of Local 222 are affected by the
shutdown. A 3-1/2 year labor contract at the plant expired
December 13.

<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul
Volcker said current data does not give a clear sign that the
deterioration in the U.S. trade balance has yet been reversed.
    "The data we have in hand do not provide clearcut evidence
that the deterioration in the trade balance has yet been
reversed," Volcker said in remarks prepared for delivery to a
luncheon for community leaders here.
    However, Volcker said there are encouraging signs,
particularly the rising volume of exports over the past year,
achieved despite relatively slow growth abroad.
    Volcker warned it is not sustainable from an economic
perspective to pile up foreign debt while failing to make the
investment needed to generate growth and earn the money to
service the debt.
    He said the process of restoring external balance to the
U.S. economy requires dealing with the budget deficit. He said
needed economic adjustment will require a relative shift of
financial and real resources into internationally competitive
industry. "More of our growth will need to be reflected in net
exports and business investment and less in consumption,"
Volcker said.

<TITLE>ALLIED-LYONS SEES NO CHANGE IN HIRAM WALKER STAKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Allied-Lyons PLC &lt;ALLD.L> and Canada's
Reichmann brothers are working well together as partners and
currently do not plan any change in their joint ownership of
distiller Hiram Walker-Gooderham and Worts, Allied-Lyons
chairman Derrick Holden-Brown said.
    Allied-Lyons got 51 pct control of Hiram Walker-Gooderham
last year for about 600 mln U.S. dlrs, while the Reichmanns'
&lt;Gulf Canada Corp> acquired 49 pct in an out-of-court pact
after a hostile battle for the wine and spirits division of
&lt;Hiram Walker Resources Ltd>.
    "We are getting along very well as partners ... I hope
there won't be any change, but there could be," Holden-Brown
told reporters after a speech in Toronto.
    He said Allied-Lyons has a two-year call option that could
force Gulf Canada to sell its 49 pct stake to Allied-Lyons, and
Gulf Canada has a two-year put option that could obligate
Allied-Lyons to buy its 49 pct.
    "Both we and Gulf hope very much there will be no occasion
for either the put or call to be exercised," Holden-Brown said.
    In answer to a reporter's question, Holden-Brown said it
would be possible for Gulf Canada to sell off part of its 49
pct in a public offering with Allied-Lyons' consent. "I don't
think we would have any objection to it," he added.
    Allied-Lyons maintains control of Hiram Walker-Gooderham's
board of directors and has total responsibility for its
management. "We cannot contemplate giving up our control," he
said.
    Holden-Brown would not disclose how big a profit
contribution the distiller will make in Allied-Lyons' financial
results, but he said "it will be substantial."
    "I am not able to give profit forecasts," he said.
    Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons was able to finance the
Hiram Walker-Gooderham acquisition with cash and borrowings,
and has no current plans for a stock issue.
    He said the company is not currently negotiating any more
acquisitions in Canada but has a team of officials evaluating
possible purchases of wines, spirits, soft drinks or food
concerns. "I don't think we shall be looking at the brewery
scene (which is) highly concentrated already," he added.
    Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons plans to list its shares on
Canadian stock exchanges, possibly later this year.

<TITLE>CARGILL OFFICIAL DEFENDS CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>The use of generic in-kind commodity
certificates has helped ease storage problems and is a
necessary part of export promotion programs, a senior executive
for the world's largest grain company said.
    Testifying before the House Agriculture subcommittee on
wheat, soybeans and feedgrains, Robbin Johnson, vice president
of Cargill, Inc., disputed claims that U.S. grain companies
have made huge profits from certificate trading.
    "The certs program is not in any way a windfall to the
trade," he said. Johnson said that Cargill has been dealing
with a two pct spread in certificate transactions, and that
this is within the normal grain marketing levels.
    Johnson recognized current concern over the cost of
certificates as compared to cash, but said that critics need to
look more closely at the savings caused by certs, noting for
example that widespread use of certs in the PIK and Roll
marketing technique last summer helped ease storage costs.
    Certificates are also an important part of any export
promotion program, he said.
    "The more you look at ways to expand export markets, the
more you have to look at ways to expand certs to put more grain
into the market to meet demand," he said.
    Subcommittee chairman Dan Glickman (D-Kans.) said his
committee would be looking at the certificate program later
this year and studying the General Accounting Office report on
certificate costs.

proposal to require the president to take action to reduce oil
imports if they threaten to top 50 pct of U.S. consumption.
    Wright told reporters the plan by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, a
fellow Texas Democrat, was positive and useful. Oil imports
peaked in 1977 at 47 pct, were short of 36 pct last year and
this year are up over 40 pct, Bentsen said. 
    The Bentsen proposal, supported by 24 other Senators, would
would require the president to issue annual three-year oil
import forecasts. In any year they threatened to top 50 pct, he
would be ordered to propose quotas or other solution.

<TITLE>BOLIVIA TO OFFER TO BUY BACK BANK DEBT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Paul Iredale, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LA PAZ, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bolivia is to make a formal offer during
the next few months to buy back its 900 mln dlrs debt from
commercial banks at a discount of up to 90 pct, central bank
president Jier Nogales said.
     Nogales told Reuters in an interview the steering
committee of Bolivia's creditor banks had agreed to consider
the offer at a meeting in New York last month.
     He said the offer would be based on the value of Bolivian
paper on the international secondary debt market, where it now
trades at between 10 and 15 pct of its face value.
    Nogales said Bolivia will make a single offer to buy back
its commercial debt and banks who accepted would be paid the
discounted rate in full.
    Banks which declined the offer would be repaid over 20 to
30 years at interest rates below those fixed in the
international markets, he added.
    Bolivia has frozen payments on medium and long term loans
to commercial banks since March, 1984, and Nogales said there
would be no money available to restart traditional debt
servicing to them for some time.
     Several Latin American countries have initiated schemes to
cancel foreign debt by equity swaps or third party buy-backs,
but Bolivia would be the first country in the region to make a
formal offer to buy back all its commercial bank debt at
discounted rates.
    Nogales said practical and strategic considerations would
determine the exact timing of the offer but it would be made in
the next few months.
     He said Bolivia would not bargain with creditor banks over
the price to paid for the debt paper they hold, and would make
a single non-negotiable offer.
    He said Bolivia could not even pay interest to friendly
creditor countries, let alone commercial banks. The only
traditional way forward was to capitalise interest, which would
mean greater bank exposure in Bolivia and greater loss
provisions, he added.
    "We are confident that the banks are going to be
reasonable," Nogales said. "Now they can resolve their problems
for once and for all."
    "The most conservative ones who want a little more will
wait a year, but I don't know if the window of opportunity will
be open all the time," he added.
    Discussing the status of other parts of Bolivia's four
billion dlr foreign debt, 2.5 billion of which is owed to
governments and the rest to international agencies, Nogales
said negotiators had achieved considerable success in recent
discussions with the Paris Club.
     He said Paris Club creditors had agreed to reschedule
Bolivian debt over 10 years with five to six years grace, while
accepting that interest would not be paid until 1989. Interest
rates were being discussed on a bilateral basis under Paris
Club rules, he added.
     He said some Paris Club members had agreed to disregard
penalty interest payments and negotiations were continuing with
Argentina and Brazil, who hold 700 mln dlrs of Bolivian debt.
    He said Bolivia was continuing to service loans from
international agencies, and it expected to receive up to 400
mln dlrs in disbursements this year.
    The capital flow for loans and their servicing had changed
from a negative balance of 250 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net inflow
of 130 mln dlrs last year, he added.
    Nogales said that Bolivia's net international reserves now
stood at around 250 mln dlrs, compared to one mln dlrs in
disposable funds when the government of Victor Paz Estenssoro
took office in August, 1985.
    Nogales said inflation, which soared to over 20,000 pct a
year in the government's first month in office, was now down to
10 pct on an annualised basis from the last six months, and the
plan was that it should continue at this level.
    He said the government was also expecting at least three
pct growth in gdp this year after several years of negative
rates.

<TITLE>U.S. MARKET LOAN NOT THAT ATTRACTIVE-BOSCHWITZ</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>A marketing loan for U.S. wheat,
feedgrains and soybeans would do nothing to help the surplus
production situation and would be extremely costly, Sen. Rudy
Boschwitz (R-Minn.) said.
    "I think I would not support a marketing loan now," he told
the House agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and
feedgrains. Boschwitz was one of the original supporters of a
marketing loan for cotton and rice, but has since focused
support on decoupling legislation, the Boren/Boschwitiz bill.
    A market loan for grains and soybeans would encourage more
production, especially in high-yielding areas, would be much
more expensive than the current cotton and rice marketing loans
and not increase exports significantly, he said.

<TITLE>U.S. HOUSE PANEL APPROVES TRADE BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>The House Ways and Means Trade 
Subcommittee unanimously approved a toned-down version of
legislation designed to toughen U.S. trade laws and wedge open
foreign markets to more U.S. goods.
    The measure now goes to the full House Ways and Means
Committee next week, but major changes are not expected,
congressional sources said.
    "This product could very well be toughening our trade policy
and doing it in a manner that opens markets without this
frightening word 'protectionism'," Ways and Means chairman Dan
Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat said.
    The trade subcommittee backed away from mandating specific
retaliation against foreign countries for unfair foreign trade
practices as the House had approved in a trade bill last year.
    But it held over for the full Ways and Means Committee
debate on a controversial plan by Rep. Richard Gephardt to
mandate a reduction in trade surpluses with the U.S. by
countries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.
    Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, has not decided the exact
form of his amendment, an aide said. Last year the House
approved his idea to force an annual ten pct trade surplus cut
by those countries. 
    The trade bill will be wrapped in with legislation from
other committees dealing with relaxation of export controls,
incentives for research, expanded worker training and education
and other efforts to increase U.S. competitiveness.
    The comprehensive trade bill is to be considered by the
full House in late April and then will be considered by Senate
committees.
    It requires President Reagan to retaliate against foreign
unfair trade practices but do not mandate quotas or tariffs and
allow an exemption if U.S. economic security would be harmed by
U.S. actions against other countries.
    The bill would make it easier for U.S. industries to win
relief from surges of imports of competitive products.
    It extends until January 1993, the administration's
authority to negotiate trade agreements as part of the new
round of multilateral talks under the General Agreements on
Tariffs and Trade.
    And, it includes provisions to tighten trade rules on
copyrights, patents and telecommunications goods.

<TITLE>INFLATION STILL A CONCERN, VOLCKER SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul
Volcker said both the Fed and the financial markets remain
concerned about the possibility of renewed inflation.
    "A possibility of renewed inflation remains of concern,
both in the markets and within the Federal Reserve," he said in
remarks prepared for delivery to a group of business leaders
here.
    He said one potential channel for renewed inflationary
pressures would be an excessive fall of the dollar in the
exchange markets, which would push import prices up sharply.
    He said participants in financial markets and business
remain skeptical of prospects for lasting price stability.
    "Should the skepticism about our ability to resist
inflation be reinforced by bad policy, the consequences for
interest rates, for exchange rates, and for the economy
generally would clearly be undesirable...recognition of that
danger neccesarily must weigh heavily in the formation of
monetary policy," the Fed chairman said.
    Volcker said attempts to drive the dollar much lower would
undermine the hard won gains against inflation and would risk
dissipating the flow of foreign capital.

<TITLE>LIVE CATTLE RALLY AS LOCKOUT AT MEAT PLANT ENDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Live cattle futures posted a robust
rally today after a major beef packing company said it would
end a lockout at its slaughtering plant in Dakota City, Neb.
    April delivery cattle on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
closed at 64.45 cents a pound, up 0.83 cent, as the market
expected demand for live animals to increase as the plant
restarts operations.
    Iowa Beef Processors, a division of Occidental Petroleum,
said it planned to reopen the plant, one of the largest in the
nation, on March 16. The plant has been closed since Dec. 14,
the day after a contract between IBP and Local 222 of the
United Food and Commercial Workers Union expired.
    The plant employs 2,800 workers and can slaughter several
thousand animals a day, a company spokesman said.
    The company said it locked out union workers because they
threatened to disrupt operations. It was unclear whether union
meatpackers would return to work. They rejected the company's
latest contract offer March 5.
    Traders said cattle prices advanced at midsession as rumors
circulated that the lockout was ending, and gains were further
fueled by a noticeable increase in demand for live animals on
cash markets in Nebraska and the Texas Panhandle.
    The rally in cattle also boosted values of live hogs and
frozen pork bellies, which also were supported by indications
that producers were expanding their hog herds at a slower rate
than previously expected.
    Petroleum futures posted a modest rally on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
    But a report that the Soviet Union planned to reduce the
price of its crude oil exports may pressure the market Friday,
said Nauman Barakat, petroleum analyst in New York with Smith
Barney, Harris Upham and Co.
    Buying by companies that deal in petroleum helped prices
recover from early weakness, traders said.
    Gold futures rallied, partly in response to strength in the
silver market, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Silver
prices rallied after a U.S. brokerage house recommended its
customers buy the metal, traders said.
    Coffee futures drifted lower in response to a report that
Colombia lowered the price of its exports, traders said.
    Sugar prices closed slightly higher on the Coffee, Sugar
and Cocoa Exchange despite a large export sale by the European
Commission on Wednesday.
    Soybeans were higher, wheat lower and corn mixed on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
    Soybeans were boosted by expectations that the Agriculture
Department would report a healthy signup for the Conservation
Reserve Program, which pays farmers to leave highly erodible
land idle instead of planting a crop, traders said.
    Concern that a strike by Brazilian seamen might interrupt
exports of soybeans from Brazil, where the harvest is just
beginning, also underpinned prices, they said.
    Wheat prices were pressured by selling in response to
trends on price charts, they said.

    The ratings include Aa3-rated first and refunding mortgage
bonds, secured pollution control revenue bonds and Eurobonds.
    Although Public Service recently received a disappointing
rate order from the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, the
agency believes the company's strong financial management
should help maintain debt-protection measurements within
current levels over the next few years.

<DATELINE>    FORT WORTH, Texas, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Permian Basin Royalty Trust
said that as of December 31, 1986, its estimated proved
reserves totaled 18.5 mln barrels of oil and 52.9 mln MCF, or
thousand cubic feet, of gas.
    This compares with yearend 1985 proved reserves estimates
of 26.4 mln barrels of oil and 78.6 mln MCF of gas, Permian
said.
    Permian said December 1986 future net revenues from proved
reserves were 335.6 mln dlrs, down from 814.2 mln dlrs in 1985.
    Permian said the present value of estimated future net
revenues discounted at 10 pct is 165.3 mln dlrs, compared with
374.3 mln dlrs.
    It said the downward revisions in both proved reserves and
estimated future net revenues resulted from decreased prices for
oil and gas.

<TITLE>VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT DEFENDS REFINANCING ACCORD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Caracas, march 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>president jaime lusinchi defended the
20.3 billion dlr debt rescheduling accord his government
recently signed, saying it will open new credit flows and bring
needed foreign investment to venezuela.
    In his annual state of the nation speech, lusinchi also
said venezuela supports other latin american debtors, despite
having reached a rescheduling accord on its own.
    In the 90-minute speech to the congress, lusinchi summed up
the achievements of his administration, which took office in
february 1984. He pointed to the 3.3 pct growth in non-oil gdp
in 1986 and to a "moderate" 12 pct inflation rate.
    Lusinchi said the 20.3 billion dlr debt rescheduling signed
feb. 27 put an end to a process which had been 'the calvary of
our nation over the post four years.'
    In the refinancing accord, he said, venezuela managed to
achieve 'the most inmportant thing, which is the reopening of
financial flows from abroad, essential for the financing of
development and the (financing) of trade and investment.'
    Once all the details of the agreement are finalized, he
said, venezuela will seek new financing for the imported
components of new development projects.
    "our intention is not to continue being net exporters of
capital, but to protect our balance of payments with a flow of
capital towards venezuela," he said.
    Under the agreement signed february 27, venezuela extended
payments on the debt from 12 to 14 years, while the interest
rate was lowered from 1 y 1/8 to 7/8 of a pct over libor.
    At the same time, payments over the next three years were
lowered from 3.450 to 1.350 billion dlrs.
    Lusinchi defended the rescheduling accord against critics
who said it merely deferred the weight of payments to future
governments.

<TITLE>BRAZIL CANCELS OIL PURCHASE FROM SAUDI ARABIA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil's state-oil company,
Petrobras, cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from Saudi
Arabia after the Saudis refused to accept credit guarantees
from the Bank of Brazil, a Petrobras official said.
    Export director Carlos Santana told a press conference the
Saudis were the first suppliers of oil to impose such
conditions after Brazil's decision to halt interest payment of
its commercial debts last month.
    The shipment of 2.2 mln barrels represents two days of oil
consumption in Brazil.
    But Santana said if the Saudis change their minds and
decide to respect the terms of the contract, then Petrobras
will lift the order to cancel the shipment.
    Santana said if the Saudis do not accept Brazil's terms by
Monday then Petrobras will negotiate elsewhere.
    "Petrobras has been Saudi Arabia's traditional client since
1955. If they do not accept our conditions now, it will be much
better for us, because with the market prices more or less the
same, buying from Iraq and China is an advantage," he said.
    Iraq and China have barter deals with Brazil, importing
Brazilian goods in exchange for oil, but the Saudis buy nothing
from Brazil, he said.
    Santana said despite a strike threat by oil industry
workers and a two-week stoppage by Brazilian seamen, Petrobras
oil stocks are "reasonably balanced." 
    Saudi Arabia is Brazil's second biggest oil supplier, with
an average 115,000 bpd. Iraq is the main supplier with 235,000
bpd. China comes third, with 58,000 bpd.
    "If the Saudis wish to stop our trade relationship, fine, I
am sure that if they do, we will be getting dozens of offers
from elsewhere," Santana added.

<TITLE>U.S. HOUSE PANEL APPROVES TRADE BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. House Ways and Means Trade
Subcommittee unanimously approved a toned-down version of
legislation designed to toughen U.S. trade laws and wedge open
foreign markets to more U.S. goods.
    The measure now goes to the full House Ways and Means
Committee next week, but major changes are not expected,
congressional sources said.
    "This product could very well be toughening our trade policy
and doing it in a manner that opens markets without this
frightening word 'protectionism'," Ways and Means chairman Dan
Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat said.
    The trade subcommittee backed away from mandating specific
retaliation against foreign countries for unfair foreign trade
practices as the House had approved in a trade bill last year.
    But it held over for the full Ways and Means Committee
debate on a controversial plan by Rep. Richard Gephardt to
mandate a reduction in trade surpluses with the U.S. by
countries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.
    Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, has not decided the exact
form of his amendment, an aide said. Last year the House
approved his idea to force an annual 10 pct trade surplus cut
by those countries.

<TITLE>FED DATA INDICATE NO POLICY CHANGE LIKELY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Martin Cherrin, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. bank reserve, monetary and
discount window borrowings data released by the Federal Reserve
today clearly indicate that policy is "on hold" and may not be
changed for weeks or even months, economists said.
    "The Fed is keeping policy at dead center and it is not
about to change policy unless something fairly dramatic occurs
on the economy," said John Williams of Bankers Trust Co.
    "These numbers contain no hint that a policy shift is in
prospect, nor do economic or financial developments argue for
policy change," said William Griggs of Griggs and Santow Inc.
    Fed data released today were all in line with economists'
expectations and similar to the numbers of recent weeks.
    The Fed said net discount window borrowings in the two
weeks ended Wednesday averaged 191 mln dlrs, up from 381 mln
dlrs in the February 25 statement period, but little changed
from 160 mln dlrs in the period before that.
    It said that banks' net free reserves in the latest two
weeks averaged 660 mln dlrs versus 675 mln dlrs previously.
    Finally, the Fed said that the M-1 money supply fell 800
mln dlrs in February, with the broader M-2 measure down 1.6
billion dlrs and M-3 up an even three billion dlrs.
    Analysts said that M-1 last month grew at a negative 1.3
pct annual rate compared with minus 0.7 pct for M-2 and actual
positive growth of 1.0 pct annualized for M-3.
    February levels of M-2 and M-3 left the aggregates 18.2 and
20.8 billion dlrs under their respective upper growth limits
set by the Fed for 1987. The annual growth target for both is
5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct. There is no M-1 target.
    "In the near term, there is absolutely no reason for the
Fed to ease policy, even apart from the slowdown in money
growth," said Stephen Slifer, economist at Lehman Government
Securities Inc.
    Economists generally expect a modest pickup in monetary
growth in March after February's anemic growth rates. However,
they stress that money growth will not be strong enough to
prevent the Fed from dropping interest rates further if the
economy shows evidence of weakness.
    Commenting on February's decline in the key M-2 aggregate,
Slifer said the main cause was a 3.2 billion dlr drop in money
market deposits at banks. This number has risen three to four
billion dlrs a month for a long while, he said, so February's
weakness is not likely to persist. Slifer expects modest M-2
and M-3 growth rates of 3-1/2 to four pct during March.
    Griggs said that M-2 and M-3 in coming months should return
to the five to seven pct annualized growth region and so
continue to present no problem for the Fed.
    Economists said the Fed appears to be very comfortable with
its current policy stance and it is likely to wait for perhaps
several more months of economic data before deciding whether or
not to ease its grip on reserves.
    Given the economy's fragility in many sectors, the analysts
agreed that there is almost no chance that the Fed will choose
to raise, rather than lower, interest rates when it next
changes policy.
    "Discount window borrowings in the past week were about as
low as the Fed can get them, although Fed funds held above six
pct," said Williams of Bankers Trust. Funds averaged 6.12 pct
in the week to Wednesday, up from 6.06 pct in the prior week.
    The Fed added reserves indirectly via one billion dlrs of
customer repurchase agreements last Friday, 2.5 billion dlrs on
Monday and two billion dlrs on Wednesday. On Tuesday, it added
reserves directly through two-day System repurchases.
    Williams and Griggs agreed the Fed will let the funds rate
be largely market-driven. They said it is focusing instead on a
borrowings target of around 300 mln dlrs.

<TITLE>COLOMBIA'S COFFEE MARKETING TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOGOTA, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Colombia intends to improve the
marketing of its coffee with the accent on more flexibility on
setting export registration prices, finance minister Cesar
Gaviria said.
    Speaking to reporters after announcing a lower export
registration price, or reintegro, of 1.10 dlr per lb ex-dock
New York, Gaviria said export mechanisms would be more agile.
    "In the first stage, we decided not only to lower the
reintegro but also to adopt a flexible policy of reintegro that
will allow private exporters to participate more actively in
Colombia's coffee export policy," he said.
    Traders said this means the export registration price will
change more often in a truer reflection of market trends.
    Gaviria said the measures merely responded to new market
factors since a return to a system of International Coffee
Organisation (ICO) export quotas may not occur in the short
term.
    ICO talks last month in London failed to break a deadlock
over re-introduction of export quotas, suspended in February
1986.
    Gaviria stressed that Colombia will not necessarily suffer
from depressed prices because it can compensate lower prices
with increased volume.
    "Colombia will continue to export its traditional amount of
coffee, between 9.6 and 10 mln bags (of 60 kilos), and will do
so without an agreement among producers," he said.
    He ruled out a much higher volume of exports, or up to 13.5
mln bags as mentioned in market circles, "because the idea is
precisely not to disrupt the market."
    Colombia exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86
coffee year which ended last September 30.
    Echoing Gaviria's words, Jorge Cardenas, manager of the
national coffee growers' federation, said Colombia sought to
adapt its coffee marketing policy to circumstances.
    "There is great expectation in the world for the policies
that Brazil and Colombia will adopt. Ours is beginning to
emerge and no agreement among producers is foreseeable in the
immediate future," he told journalists.
    Trade sources in Rio today said Brazil's future export
policy was unlikely to be revealed before the end of next week.
    Cardenas said a new ICO meeting could only take place when
problems that hindered an agreement at the recent London talks
have been resolved.
    Asked to comment on a Reuter report from Jakarta saying
Indonesia hoped Colombia could use its contacts with Brazil to
suggest a compromise on the quota issue, Cardenas said the
Brazilian stand was quite clear.
    He said Brazil's current quota "reflects the reality of the
market, allows for an orderly supply and satisfies demand," but
added more clarity was needed to assess the criteria that
determined it.
    Cardenas said lows registered immediately after the failure
of the London talks were triggered by a widespread fear among
dealers of an imminent price war and the belief that producers
would go out and sell their coffee as quickly as possible,
which did not happen.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>The World Bank said it approved a
140 mln dlr loan for India to help lessen that country's
dependence on imported oil and spur development of its own
petroleum resources.
    The bank said the loan will be used to boost production by
injecting gas in the partially depleted Assam oil fields and to
assist exploration in other areas, including drilling 10
exploratory wells.
    The bank said the recipient of the 20-year loan will be Oil

<TITLE>INVESTORS MORE ACTIVE IN GILT MARKET, SURVEY SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Institutional investors are finding it
difficult to find "the best price" for transactions in U.K.
Government bonds (gilts) and have become more active in the
market since the deregulation of the London Stock Exchange in
October, agency broker Capel-Cure Myers said in a survey.
    The survey, covering a broad section of institutional
investors, also showed that investors were uneasy about the
impartiality of market makers' advice. Given their concerns,
over half those surveyed said they spend more time managing
their portfolios. At the same time, the investors believed the
market was more liquid and efficient than before Big Bang.
    Capel-Cure, a unit of Australia and New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd, conducted the survey during January among 70
institutions which are not clients of that firm.
    Banks and merchant banks accounted for 32 pct of the total,
building societies 30 pct, life assurance companies 20 pct,
insurance companies 11 pct and pension funds seven pct.
    The survey found that with the virtual elimination of
commissions, the improved market liquidity has encouraged
investors to deal more frequently in the market. Of those
responding, 70 pct were encouraged to deal more actively, 25
pct which saw no change and five pct dealt less actively.
    A Capel-Cure official told reporters the elimination of
commissions has made the market more competitive.
    He said Capel-Cure has deliberately set low commisstions
because of this.
    Nearly half the respondents said they now have their own
dealing team to cope with the new market, although the
definition of a "dealing team" was ambiguous, the survey said.
    Rather than being a self-contained, specialised group of
dealers who spend all their time searching for prices, the
definition now appears to be the less formal idea of a
multi-purpose fund manager, it said.
    The survey supported the general view in the gilt market
that a shake-out of the 27 market-makers is likely.
    It showed nearly 90 pct of the respondents believed that
the total number of market makers in three years time would be
less than 20, while 46 pct thought the number would be less
than 15.
    Some 79 pct of respondents said they expect the number of
agency brokers (for which there was no estimate) to fall over
the next three years. Unlike broker/dealers, agency brokers do
not take positions in the market, but the survey showed 68 pct
of respondents did not consider this very important when
deciding whether to use one.

<TITLE>VENEZUELA TO LEND ECUADOR 50,000 BPD OF CRUDE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CARACAS, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Venezuela will lend Ecuador 50,000
barrels per day of crude oil over the next few months to help
it meet its export commitments, Energy and Mines Minister
Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said today.
    He said that under the terms of this loan, agreed during a
visit here this week by Ecuador's Deputy Energy Minister
Fernando Santos Alvite, Ecuador will begin repaying the loan in
August.
    Hernandez Grisanti said the loan will go part way to
offsetting the loss of Ecuador's 140,000 in exports caused by
earthquake damage to 25 miles of pipeline last week.
    Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline
connecting its jungle oil fields with the pacific port of Balao
was put out of action.
    Venezuela has an output quota of 1.495 bpd, while Ecuador's
is 210,000 bpd. Santos Alvite said Ecuador will ask OPEC to
allow it to produce 100,000 bpd above its quota when the
pipeline is repaired to offset present production losses.
    Hernandez Grisanti said also a first 300,000 barrels
shipment of Venezuelan crude oil will leave for Ecuador this
weekend to help meet domestic consumption needs.
    The oil, part of a five mln additional crude oil loan by
Venezuela, will be processed at Guayaquil refineries.
    "If we had not supplied oil to Ecuador the life of this
country would have ground to a halt," he said.

<TITLE>PHILIPPINE DEBT TALKS FINELY POISED, BANKERS SAY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alan Wheatley, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Debt talks between the Philippine
government and its bank advisory committee were delicately
poised after a brief meeting between the two sides today,
bankers and sources close to the Philippine delegation said.
    "We had a businesslike meeting and made good progress," a
banker said. "The banks are anxious to come to an agreement."
    But bankers were reluctant to predict whether the talks
would end successfully. Caution was also evident in the
Philippine camp. "We feel the ball's in the banks' court," one
source said. The two sides will meet again on Friday.
    The talks, in which the Philippines is seeking to
reschedule about 9.4 billion dlrs of debt, are now dominated
by a discussion of the innovative proposal made by finance
minister Jaime Ongpin to pay part of the country's interest
bill in Philippine Investment Notes, PINs, instead of cash.
    Manila wants to pay the London Interbank Offered Rate in
cash and to issue PINs in respect of the margin above LIBOR.
    The banks rejected the original PINs proposal last Friday,
but Ongpin presented a revised proposal on Monday which sought
to satisfy the banks' objections by guaranteeing that the notes
would yield 7/8 pct over LIBOR in cash.    
    The banks have apparently yet to pass final judgment on the
new proposal.
    Senior Reagan Administration officials expressed warm
support for the PINs proposal this week, which gave Ongpin hope
that the banks would embrace the idea.
    But the banks are still being circumspect, weighing
possible accounting consequences as well as considering the
precedents that they would set if they agreed to PINS.
    One of the  main architects of the PINs proposal, U.S.
lawyer Lee Buchheit, is adamant that the banks have nothing to
worry about.
    "To the extent that it's a precedent, it's a precedent to
be encouraged," Buchheit, a partner with Cleary, Gottlieb,
Steen and Hamilton, told a debt-equity swaps conference
sponsored by Euromoney magazine.
    Under the proposal, banks would sell the dollar-denominated
PINs at a discount to multinational firms which would convert
them into pesos at face value to fund government-approved
equity investments in the Philippines.
    In effect, international firms would be paying part of
Manila's interest bill, allowing the government to conserve
much-needed hard currency.
    One of the beauties of the scheme, according to Buchheit,
is that it widens the scope of third-world debt negotiations,
which have been confined to debtors and creditors for the past
4-1/2 years.
    "There's another pool of cash at the table now," he said.
    David Mulford, Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Treasury,
told the Euromoney conference that ideas such as PINs should be
part of a "menu" of options available to banks instead of pure
new-money packages.
    He said the difficulty of syndicating Mexico's 7.7 billion
dlr loan package shows that new approaches must be encouraged.
    "We must face the fact that greater flexibility in devising
new money packages may, in effect, be essential to future bank
syndications," Mulford said.
    In an unusually frank comment about the Mexican deal, he
said that dissatisfaction with Mexico's economic program and
criticism of communication and coordination within the bank
syndicate had prompted a number of banks to refuse to
participate in the loan.
    This refusal "for a time appeared to jeopardize the
prospects for successful agreement with the rest of the banks,"
Mulford said.
    The Mexican package is now due to be signed on March 20,
but bankers said the U.S. clearly feels the need to breathe new
life into the financing process, especially with crucial
negotiations with Brazil, about to start.
    The banks for their part insist that they are more than
willing to discuss Mulford's "menu", and say it is the debtors
that need to be more flexible. For example, they say financing
talks with Argentina are proving tough because Buenos Aires
dislikes the debt-equity schemes and onlending provisions that
the banks are promoting. But whether the banks are ready to
endorse the PINs concept right away still hangs in the balance.

reached a pay deal with striking seamen, but union leaders said
most of Brazil's 40,000 seamen were still on strike.
    A union spokesman in Rio de Janeiro said the seamen had
accepted a 120 pct pay offer from the companies, Globo and
Flumar, which have less than 200 employees each.
    The two-week strike comes as Brazil faces a debt crisis and
is delaying exports badly needed to earn foreign exchange.
    Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto said the government will
not force a settlement of the strike, which was ruled illegal
last Friday.

<TITLE>ADSTEAM RIGHTS ISSUE TO RAISE 228 MLN DLRS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ADELAIDE, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd &lt;ADSA.S>
(Adsteam) said its one-for-five rights issue at 11.50 dlrs a
share will raise 228.5 mln dlrs for general working capital and
investment, both in Australia and overseas.
    The group announced the issue with its first half earnings
and said in a statement that the rights issue will be followed
by a one-for-four bonus issue.
    Adsteam's equity-accounted net earnings rose to 75.05 mln
dlrs in the half ended December 31 from 55.68 mln a year
earlier and interim dividend to 18 cents from 16.
    Adsteam shares eased to 14.20 dlrs from an opening 14.60
and yesterday's close of 14.50 on the issue announcement.
    The issue will be underwritten by &lt;Morgan Grenfell
Australia Ltd> and &lt;McCaughan Dyson Ltd> apart from the shares
to be taken up by Adsteam's associate and largest shareholder,
department store retailer &lt;David Jones Ltd>.
    New shares will not rank for the interim dividend but will
rank equally thereafter.
    Adsteam said it expects to maintain an annual dividend rate
of 36 cents on capital enlarged to about 149 mln shares by both
issues from 99.36 mln.
    Adsteam said its diverse industrial interests generally
performed well and its results, as the ultimate holding company
and beneficiary, reflected this solid performance.
    David Jones, owned 49.2 pct by Adsteam, earned the largest
associates' net of 57.38 mln dlrs in the half against 40.29 mln
a year earlier, Adsteam's figures show.
    Wholly-owned and joint venture companies also did well
apart from timber, building supplies and real estate, which
returned below-budget profits due to the housing downturn.
    Adsteam said it sees 1987/88 as a year of reconstruction
and consolidation with the capital base boosted by the issue.

<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>The &lt;Hearst Corp> is buying the Houston
Chronicle from Houston Endowment Inc for 400 mln dlrs.
    The announcement was made jointly by Frank Bennack Jr,
president and chief executive officer of Hearst, and Richard
Johnson, president of the Chronicle.
    The Houston Endowment is selling the paper to comply with
federal tax laws requiring charitable institutions to divest
themselves of profit-making subsidiaries by 1989.
    The Chronicle has a daily circulation of over 425,000 and
is in competition with the Houston Post, owned by the &lt;Toronto
Sun Publishing Corp>, with a circulation of about 316,000.
    The acquisition gives Hearst its biggest newspaper holding
in Texas, where the California-based publisher already owns
papers in San Antonio, Beaumont and Laredo.
    The chain also owns, among others, the flagship San
Francisco Examiner, the Los Angeles Herald Examiner and the
Seattle Post-Intelligencer.

<TITLE>U.S. OFFICIALS DISAGREE ON REDUCING BUDGET DEFICIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Senior U.S. Economic officials
disagree on the likelihood the government can meet its budget
deficit reduction targets.
    Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisers, reiterated the Reagan Administration's opposition to
a tax increase and its pledge to reduce the deficit by cutting
spending and fostering economic growth.
    By contrast, Rudolph Penner, Director of the Congressional
Budget Office, said the budget process has broken down and the
deficit will remain close to 200 billion dlrs for fiscal 1987.
    Sprinkel told a symposium sponsored by New York University
that spending could be cut by avoiding decisions based on the
desire to influence votes and by shifting the responsibility
for local projects to state governments.
    He also suggested a line-item veto, which allows the
President to veto parts of bill without rejecting all of it, to
limit wasteful spending. Spending and taxing decisions should
be linked more closely.
    Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 2.7 pct
growth in U.S. Real gross national product (GNP) in 1987 and
3.5 pct in 1988.
    Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate of
economic growth is attainable, Sprinkel said, "It looks pretty
good to me. We've had two very strong employment reports."
    He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate, adding,
"It looks like they're on track."
    While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit,
Sprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact.
    The new 1987 tax laws will not hurt the economy and the tax
reform act of 1986 significantly lowers tax rates and will
greatly increase private production incentives, he said.
    "Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggest
national net output of goods and services will permanently
increase by approximately two pct because of the long-run
consequences of tax reform," Sprinkel said. "In 1986, this would
have amounted to an increase of approximately 600 dlrs in the
income of the average American family."
    Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsible
for the large increase in the budget deficit.
    In fiscal 1986 ending September, federal spending amounted
to 23.8 pct of GNP, while federal receipts absorbed 18.5 pct of
GNP, leaving a deficit of 5.3 pct, he said.
    Sprinkel said that, compared with fiscal 1978, the 1986
federal expenditure share of GNP is 2.7 percentage points
higher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same.
    "Contrary to the conventional wisdom, therefore, the 1981
tax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budget
deficits of the past few years," Sprinkel said.
    "This tax cut merely rolled back the inflation-induced tax
increases that occurred between 1978 and 1981," he added.
    However, the Congressional Budget Office's Rudolph Penner
argued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided.
    "Since making the big mistake in 1981 of cutting taxes
enormously without any plan to decrease spending by the
Administration or Congress, indeed with increases in defence
spending, now all the options (for reducing the budget deficit)
are unpleasant," he said.
    Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideological
turmoil in the U.S. Caused by the "biggest sustained inflation
in our nation's history," which helped foster widespread
distrust of government.
    "The American people turned on the government with tax
revolt at the state level and new demands on the government at
the national level," Penner said.
    "But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislike
of spending programs. Now the correction of that 1981 mistake
demands that the system change a lot."
    Penner sees little hope the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget
deficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit will
remain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year.
    He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily is
not likely to succeed.
    "I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries to
dictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simply
because there's no ... Way to enforce it," Penner said.
    Penner questioned the methods by which the 1987 budget
deficit was cut. He said 18 to 19 billion dlrs were eliminated
by one-time measures, such as a temporary increase in taxes
related to tax reform and sales of government assets.
    "Another four billion dlrs was cut by what I call creative
timing changes, like moving the military payday from the last
day of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988. That saved
more than two billion dlrs," Penner said.

0.8 pct in the third quarter and 2.7 pct a year earlier, the
Statistics Bureau said.
    It said the seasonally adjusted current account deficit of

<TITLE>CHINA FACES DILEMMA OVER SUGAR IMPORTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Mark O'Neill, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>China has to decide if it will increase
sugar imports this year to cover falling domestic output and
rising demand, in view of market predictions that international
sugar prices will remain firm this year, traders and the
official press said.
    He Kang, Minister of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and
Fisheries, said this week that China has adjusted the
purchasing price for sugar cane and beet to check a drop in
production last year but he gave no price details.
    One Japanese trader said domestic demand is rising rapidly
because of improving living standards and rising demand for
sweet drinks, cakes and biscuits and other sugary foods.
    "It will not be easy to cut domestic demand, even in a
state-controlled economy. China may have to import," he said.
    Customs figures show imports fell to 1.182 mln tonnes in
1986 from 1.909 mln in 1985 and fell to 25,165 tonnes in
January 1987 from 54,000 in January 1986.
    The official Economic Information newspaper last month said
production in the 1986/87 crushing season (September-April)
will be 1.18 mln tonnes short of demand.
    The paper put 1986/87 output at 4.82 mln, down from 5.24
mln in 1985/86, and domestic demand at about six mln tonnes.
    "In the last two years, acreage under sugar cane and beet
has fallen, sugar mills are underutilised, output has dropped
and cannot meet demand that is rising every day," it said.
    "The country will have to continue imports of sugar and draw
down stocks to meet market demand," it added.
    It quoted the Ministry of Light Industry as blaming the
drop in output on unreasonable state purchasing prices for cane
and beet as against other crops, which has resulted in farmers
refusing to grow them.
    The paper said in 1985 a farmer could earn up to three
times more per hectare from pineapple and watermelon and up to
seven times more from bananas than from sugarcane. He could
sell grain on the free market at 560 yuan a tonne, against only
70 yuan a tonne for sugarcane.
    Sugar mills are suffering because refined sugar prices have
not changed for 20 years despite rising costs, it said.
    In Fujian, the cost of producing one tonne rose to 702 yuan
in 1985 from 520.1 in 1980, cutting the mills' profit to 117
yuan a tonne from 217.9, it added.
    The paper said unreasonable pricing resulted in 144 of the
442 sugar mills working in the 1985/86 crushing season losing
money. China has 521 sugar mills.
    A foreign agricultural expert forecast a drop in cane
acreage in 1986/87 (September-August) of up to 10 pct in
Guangdong, which produced 45 pct of China's sugar in calendar
1985, and a smaller drop in Fujian, which produced 11 pct of
China's sugar in calendar 1985.
    He said both provinces are more developed than other
sugar-producing areas and more sensitive to demand from cities.
    But cane acreage in Guangxi and Yunnan, which accounted for
28 pct of the 1985 crop, has risen by 10 to 30 pct in 1986/87,
because cane-growing is more economic there, he said.
    He put sugar stocks at 2.333 mln tonnes in September 1986.
    A Hong Kong trader estimated stocks at more than three mln
at end-January. "Now they are falling but (they) have not
reached the critical level, compelling China to import quickly,"
he said.
    "China has options not easily available in western
countries. It controls stocks strictly and can release less
into the consumer market if stocks fall too quickly," he said.
    The Hong Kong trader said calendar 1987 imports will be
slightly less than those of 1986, because of firm world prices
and serious foreign exchange constraints which, he said, are
likely to continue until at least end-1988.
    He said nearly all cane and beet is sold to the state-owned
mills, with a small amount sold raw to consumers.
    "Most of the mills are old and inefficient, with many of
them using Soviet equipment imported in the 1950s," he said.
    He said demand in rural areas will in future rise an annual
four pct, with demand in the cities rising an annual two pct.

<TITLE>JAPAN DENIES BREAKING SEMICONDUCTOR TRADE PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan denied breaking a pact with the
U.S. On semiconductor trade but said prices set out in the pact
were too high and acknowledged difficulties in implementing the
accord.
    "We are faithfully abiding by the ... Agreement but of
course there are some problems," a spokesman for the
International Trade and Industry Ministry told Reuters.
    He said the high semiconductor prices recommended by the
agreement were leaving Japanese manufacturers piling up stocks
of unsellable products. "We are aiming to reduce production in
Japan but of course this takes time," he said.
    The spokesman said some Japanese companies were selling
chips in Europe and Asia below stipulated prices, but added: "It
is only a matter of time before we solve this problem."
    The eight month old pact aims to stop Japan selling large
quantities of chips at knock-down prices to the United States
and other countries and to increase U.S. Semiconductor sales in
Japan.
    The U.S. Senate Finance Committee this week called on
President Reagan in a non-binding resolution to retaliate
against Japan for violating the agreement.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIAN BEEF OUTPUT SEEN DECLINING IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Australian beef output is forecast to
decline to 1.34 mln tonnes carcass weight in 1987 and 1.36 mln
in 1988 from 1.44 mln in 1986, the Australian Meat and
Live-Stock Corp (AMLC) said.
    Exports of beef/veal are also predicted to decline to
480,000 tonnes shipped weight in 1987 from 515,000 in 1986, and
then rally to 490,000 in 1988, the AMLC said in a summary of
its bi-annual meat and livestock forecasts.
    It sees cattle numbers remaining at around the 1986 level
of 23.2 mln beasts in both years because herd rebuilding is
expected to be slower than previously forecast.
    Beef producers are becoming more confident that higher
returns in the market, both domestically and overseas, will
continue, the AMLC said.
    The slow herd build-up and the forecast lower production is
expected to bring about a slight drop in both export and
domestic consumption this year, it said.
    The forecast does not assume a turnaround in production
levels until late next year.
    It said the outlook for beef exports as a proportion of
output remains much the same as last year when it was around 55
pct of total production. In 1985 it was 52 pct.
    The increase in exports of beef as a percentage of
production has mainly been attributed to the decline in the
Australian dollar, the AMLC said.
    It also forecast that Australia's four major markets, the
U.S., Japan, Canada and Taiwan, will continue to dominate the
chilled and frozen beef export markets. They take collectively
around 94 pct of total Australian exports.

the Federal Customs Office said.
    February imports were 6.00 billion francs against exports
of 5.37 billion.
    Imports rose in real terms by 5.1 pct against February 1986
while exports rose by a real 4.6 pct, the office said.
    But a further improvement in the terms of trade left the
deficit smaller than last year.
    Last February's figure had also been hit by the import of
two passenger aircraft.

<TITLE>JAPAN SHIPBUILDERS SEEK CARTEL TO RESTRICT OUTPUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese shipbuilders have applied to the
state's Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to restrict
tonnage built to about half of total capacity for the year
starting April 1, officials of the Shipbuilders Association of
Japan said.
    Under the plan, 33 yards capable of building ships of more
than 10,000 gross tons will curtail operations to three mln
compensated gross registered tonnes (CGRT) a year against
capacity of about six mln CGRT.
    The Transport Ministry estimates new orders at 3.3 mln CGRT
in the year to March 1988 and 3.1 mln the following year.
    The industry has curtailed production due to oversupply
nearly every year since 1977/78, under cartel or Transport
Ministry guidelines. The latest guidelines call for a ceiling
of four mln CGRT in the year to March 31.
    The cartels, self-imposed and self-regulated, are not
legally binding, but industry finds it in its own interest to
stick to them.
    The slowdown in orders has been caused by the strong yen
and a protracted worldwide shipbuilding slump.

<DATELINE>    BERNE, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Swiss wholesale prices fell by 0.3 pct in
February, giving a drop of 4.3 pct from February 1986, the
Federal Office of Industry, Trade and Labour said.
    Prices had been unchanged in January, giving an annual drop
of 4.6 pct. They fell by 2.6 pct in the year to February 1986.
    The wholesale price index, base 1963, stood at 168.5 in
February from 176.1 last year.
    The office said the fall was largely due to lower prices
for energy, raw materials and semi-finished goods. Consumer
goods prices rose slightly.

<TITLE>SINGAPORE MONETARY EXCHANGE FACES NON-ASIAN RIVALS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Tay Liam Hwee, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SINGAPORE, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Expanding global links between
futures markets mean that the Singapore International Monetary
Exchange (SIMEX) must add Chicago and London to its list of
rivals, banking sources said.
    When SIMEX and the Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE) introduced
U.S. Treasury bond futures last autumn, the sources expected to
see fierce rivalry between the two exchanges, ending with only
one winner in Asia.
    But surprisingly, the challenges now appear to be coming
from the other side of the world, they said.
    The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) will introduce night
trading in its U.S. Treasury bond contract on April 30, which
could clash with SIMEX morning activity, banking sources said.
    The CBOT had planned to introduce night trading on April 2,
but postponed the move to allow participants time to prepare.
    The London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE)
could cut further into the SIMEX contract with a U.S. Treasury
bond contract that can be offset on the CBOT, they said. Such a
LIFFE contract is expected later this year.
    LIFFE liquidity could be higher than at the SIMEX, where
average daily volume in Treasury bonds dropped to 165 in
February from 1,286 last October when the bonds were first
introduced.
    The contracts were set up to attract hedging from the
rapidly growing underlying cash market in U.S. Treasury bonds
in Toyko, but interest has waned as that market has grown more
stable, traders said.
    Restrictions on investments by Japanese residents have also
inhibited the growth of the futures contracts in both Singapore
and Sydney, the banking sources said.
    Nevertheless, all 450 seats on SIMEX are now taken, with
the last trading at 55,000 dlrs against the initial price of
50,000 dlrs. The current bid is 55,500 dlrs, but offers at
65,000 show that confidence in SIMEX remains, said Michael
Killian, general manager of Chase Manhattan Futures Corp.
    Killian, a SIMEX board member, said the CBOT night session
might raise arbitrage opportunities and SIMEX would benefit
from a local stock exchange index contract planned for the end
of 1987. SIMEX also became more competitive after this month's
budget eliminated withholding tax on interest earned on futures
margin deposits.
    Banking sources said the tax change would boost SIMEX
trading by non-bank institutions and individuals and would
benefit foreign firms and institutions.
    While the Treasury bond contract has been somewhat
disappointing, other SIMEX contracts continue to expand, Fong
Yew Meng, SIMEX assistant general manager, told Reuters.
    Volume in the SIMEX's Nikkei stock index, based on the
Tokyo stock market, has risen to a daily average of more than
1,000 contracts this month, from 320 contracts last October,
helped by uncertainty during the recent bull run in Tokyo
stocks, Fong said.
    Open interest in the Nikkei contract, introduced last year,
reached a record 2,697 on February 26.
    Killian said the Nikkei contract has considerable potential
for expansion, as overseas investors have been avoiding the
contract because they currently see no need to hedge the rising
cash market in Tokyo.
    SIMEX is also enjoying record trading in other contracts.
In February, total volume on the exchange reached a record
122,819 contracts, surpassing the previous monthly record of
116,767 set in September. Eurodollar volume reached a record
78,546 contracts last month against 70,306 in September.
    SIMEX is likely to try to maintain its growth by moving
into options soon, but competition continues regionally as well
as globally, banking sources said.
    The Sydney exchange plans to introduce by June a share
index futures contract based on a composite of stocks on which
equity options are traded, which could generate more liquidity
than the ordinary index, banking sources said.
    Local interest in the Sydney Treasury bond contract may
also flare if the Sydney exchange establishes a three-way link
with Chicago and London, traders in Sydney said.
    LIFFE is discussing such a link with the CBOT, they said.

coins of 500 yen or less.

involving the construction of two bridges valued at 20 mln

    He said Malaysia agreed to the oil-for-bridges deal in
October after India said it could no longer buy some 700,000
tonnes of palm oil a year because of its trade deficit.
    Malaysia has also agreed to barter palm oil for 30 mln dlrs
of hydroelectric equipment and is interested in countertrading
for Indian iron ore, wheat and other goods and services, he
said.

rate movements in correcting international trade imbalances
appears to be waning, and long-term efforts are required to cut

Japan said in a monthly report.
    Japan's trade surplus in nominal terms is likely to remain
high in the near future, the central bank said.
    Fundamental adjustments will be needed as long as Japan
hopes to benefit from a better international allocation of
resources and maintain the free trade system, it added.

he sees the oil market continuing bullish, with underlying

    He told a press conference in Jakarta at the end of a

saw prices stabilizing around 18 dlrs a barrel.
    "The sentiment in the market is bullish and I think it will
continue that way as demand will go up in the third or fourth
quarters," Subroto said.
    Asked about the prospect for oil prices, he said: "I think
they will stabilise around 18 dlrs, although there is a little
turbulence ..."
    "Of course the spot price will fluctuate, but the official
price will remain at 18 dlrs," he added.

<TITLE>OPEC DEFENDING 18 DLR PRICE, SUBROTO SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said
OPEC is deliberately under its production ceiling of 15.8 mln
barrels to defend its 18 dlr a barrel price target.
    He told reporters at an energy conference in Jakarta that
OPEC had decided to maintain its price level of 18 dlrs.
    "We are deliberately defending the price, so OPEC production
is less than 15.8 (mln) at the moment," he stated.
    Asked if OPEC would increase production if prices went
above 18 dlrs a barrel, he said this would be decided at the
next OPEC meeting in June. "We will discuss the market situation
then," he added.
    He said a meeting of the OPEC Differentials Committee had
been postponed because "there is no need for the meeting."
    He did not elaborate. The committee had originally been due
to meet in Vienna this week.

<TITLE>JAPAN REJECTS U.S. OBJECTIONS TO FAIRCHILD SALE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Linda Sieg, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>A Foreign Ministry official dismissed
arguments made by senior U.S. Government officials seeking to
block the sale of a U.S. Microchip maker to a Japanese firm.
    "They appear to be linking completely unrelated issues,"
Shuichi Takemoto of the Foreign Ministry's North American
Division told Reuters.
    U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige has asked the
White House to consider blocking the sale of &lt;Fairchild
Semiconductor Corp> to Japan's Fujitsu Ltd &lt;ITSU.T>, U.S.
Officials said yesterday.
    Baldrige expressed concern that the sale would leave the
U.S. Military dependent on a foreign company for vital high
technology equipment. Pentagon officials said Defence Secretary
Caspar Weinberger also opposes to the sale.
    U.S. Officials have also said the sale would give Fujitsu a
powerful role in the U.S. Market for supercomputers while
Japan's supercomputer market remains closed to U.S. Sales.
    Takemoto said national security should not be an issue
since the planned purchase of Fairchild from its current owner,
Schlumberger Ltd &lt;SLB>, does not include Fairchild's main
defence-related division.
    In addition, Takemoto said tension over the supercomputer
trade should not affect the sale as Fairchild does not make
supercomputers.
    Analysts noted that Fairchild does make sophisticated
microchips used in supercomputers. Fujitsu makes similar chips
and supplies them to U.S. Supercomputer makers, they said.
    Takemoto also dismissed U.S. Fears that the proposed
takeover would violate U.S. Antitrust law, saying "the purchase
would not result in Fujitsu monopolising the U.S. Semiconductor
market."
    Two separate issues appear to have come together to boost
pressure to block the purchase, industry analysts said.
    The move is in part an attempt to force Japan to open its
domestic market to more U.S. Supercomputer sales, they said.
    U.S. Officials have repeatedly charged that the Japanese
public sector is closed to U.S. Supercomputer sales despite
U.S. Firms' technological lead in the field.
    "The United States believes Japan will only react when
bullied, and this is a bullying ploy," Salomon Brothers Asia
analyst Carole Ryavec said.
    However, the analysts said more is at stake than
supercomputer sales as the U.S. Fears it is losing its vital
semiconductor industry to Japanese competitors.
    "The real issue is xenophobia in (the U.S.) Silicon Valley,"
said Tom Murtha of brokerage James Capel and Co.
    U.S.-Japanese tension over the semiconductor trade has
failed to subside despite recent efforts by Japan's Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (MITI) to get Japanese firms
to abide by a bilateral pact aimed at halting predatory pricing
and opening Japan's market.
    A MITI official said that while Japan is faithfully abiding
by the agreement, problems remain in halting the sale of
microchips in Europe and Southeast Asia at prices below those
set by the pact.
    "It is only a matter of time before we solve this problem,"
he told Reuters.
    Despite the furore, Fujitsu will proceed with talks on the
acquisition in line with the basic agreement reached with
Schlumberger last year, a Fujitsu spokeswoman told Reuters.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England said it invited an
early round of bill offers to help ease tight conditions in the
money market.
    The bank estimated today's liquidity shortage at about 1.10
billion stg.
    Bills maturing in official hands and the treasury bill
take-up would drain 1.21 billion stg from the system while a
rise in the note circulation and below target bankers' balances
would take out 265 mln and 180 mln respectively, the bank said.
    Against this, exchequer transactions would add a net 535
mln stg.

<DATELINE>    BANGKOK, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Kampuchea harvested more than two mln
tonnes of rice paddy in 1986, up on the crops of the previous
two years, the official SPK news agency said yesterday.
    Diplomats said estimates put the 1985 harvest at less than
one mln tonnes, slightly up on 800,000 in 1984.
    SPK said Kampuchea planned to expand planting from 1.5 mln
to 1.93 mln hectares and boost rice paddy output to 2.5 mln
tonnes this calendar year.
    Two mln tonnes of paddy would produce some 1.3 mln tonnes
of milled rice, above the 1.25 mln tonnes Kampuchea says is the
minimum its 7.5 mln people need.

<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>China's 1987 cotton output must rise
above the 1986 level of 3.54 mln tonnes or supply will fall
short of increasing demand, the China Daily said.
    Demand in 1986 rose 10.9 pct over 1985.
    Output in 1986 fell from 4.15 mln tonnes in 1985 and a
record 6.2 mln in 1984, official figures show. The China Daily
attributed the decline to several factors, including less
favorable weather conditions and new state measures to restrict
cotton production after the 1984 build-up of stocks.
    According to Customs figures, cotton exports rose to
558,089 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 347,026 in 1985.
    To increase output quickly, the state will raise by 10 pct
the price it pays for cotton produced above and beyond quota
levels, the newspaper said. Its official purchasing agencies
will buy cotton produced in excess of that originally
contracted for, it added.
    The China Daily said all cotton growing areas in south
China should be maintained, and growing in the north should be
concentrated in Hebei, Shandong, Henan and Xinjiang.
    It called for comprehensive planning to coordinate
production of cotton with that of grain, edible oil and other
crops, but gave no more details.

    There is a 10 basis point utilisation fee if the
underwriters are required to pick up more than 67 pct of the

34-67 pct of the paper. No utilisation fee will be charged if
they are to pick up less than 33 pct.
    Underwriting fee is 1/8 pct.
    Under the facility, notes in denominations of 500,000 dlrs

<TITLE>JAPAN BROKERS SEEK 10 YEAR GOVERNMENT BOND AUCTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese securities houses have asked the
Finance Ministry again to consider introducing auctions of
10-year government bonds, securities sources said.
    Finance Ministry officials declined comment but said the
Ministry has been aware of growing calls from securities houses
for 10-year bond auctions.
    Japanese securities houses also may allow foreign brokers
to underwrite more 10-year bonds from April. Four U.S. Banks
are expected to receive Finance Ministry approval in late April
to operate securities subsidiaries in Japan as long as they
hold no more than 50 pct of the capital, bankers said.
    These firms are likely to join the syndicate, which will
increase the number of participants in the 10-year government
bond primary market, securities managers said.
    Each of the 17 current foreign securities houses in the
syndicate underwrites 0.07 pct of each issue, they said.
    In order to expand participation by foreigners, the
syndicate must either expand the securities industry's 26 pct
share or introduce auctions to the primary market, they said.
    Local brokers have requested the head of the syndicate, now
Fuji Bank Ltd, to increase their share to 30.7 pct but banks
oppose any cut in their 74 pct share, bankers said.

<TITLE>PETROBRAS CANCELS OIL PURCHASE FROM SAUDI ARABIA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil's state oil company
Petrobras has cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from
Saudi Arabia after the Saudis refused to accept credit
guarantees from the Bank of Brazil and did not disclose
reasons, a Petrobras official said.
    Export director Carlos Santana told reporters the Saudis
were the first suppliers of oil to impose such conditions after
Brazil's decision to halt interest payment of its commercial
debts last month. The shipment of 2.2 mln barrels represents
two days of consumption.
    He said the Saudis reported they would no longer accept
letters of credit from the Bank of Brazil or even from Saudi
banks and that Brazil would have to obtain credit guarantees
from leading international banks.
    In February, Brazil had contracted to buy 125,000 bpd from
the Saudis until June. Saudi Arabia is Brazil's second biggest
oil supplier, with an average 115,000 bpd. Iraq is the main
supplier with 235,000 bpd. China comes third, with 58,000 bpd.
    "If the Saudis wish to stop our trade relationship...I am
sure that if they do, we will be getting dozens of offers from
elsewhere," Santana added.
    Santana said if the Saudis change their minds and decide to
respect the terms of the contract, then Petrobras will lift the
order to cancel the shipment.
    The Saudis had put similar conditions on a previous
shipment, he added. "We telexed them saying that if they
insisted, we would rather cancel the contract and buy the
product elsewhere," Santana said.
    After Petrobras threatened to cancel the contract, the
Saudis changed their minds and decided to accept the Bank of
Brazil's credit guarantees, he said.

<TITLE>MANNESMANN CONSIDERING MAJORITY STAKE IN FICHTEL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DUESSELDORF, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>A Mannesmann AG &lt;MMWG.F> spokesman
said the company has lodged an application with the Federal
Cartel Office for approval of a possible majority stake in car
parts company &lt;Fichtel und Sachs AG>.
    He described the application as a precautionary move and
said no agreement on buying a majority stake had yet been
reached. Until now Mannesmann has said only that it wanted to
buy a 37.5 pct stake in Fichtel from the heirs of Ernst Wilhelm
Sachs, the grandson of the firm's founder.
    The spokesman declined to say from whom it may buy the
other shares to create a majority stake in the firm.
    Fichtel's other principal shareholders are Commerzbank AG
&lt;CBKG.F>, with 35.01 pct, and Salzgitter AG &lt;ISLG.F>, with
24.98 pct. Spokesmen declined to comment directly on the
possibility of selling Fichtel shares to Mannesmann.
    Mannesmann said in January it hoped to take a 37.5 pct
stake in Fichtel's holding company Sachs AG in the first
quarter.
    Last week a spokesman said Mannesmann had a letter of
intent on the 37.5 pct stake but completion was being delayed
by legal questions surrounding the inheritance.

<TITLE>SCHWEIZERHALLE FIRE HIT SANDOZ 1986 PROFITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BASLE, Switzerland, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sandoz AG &lt;SANZ.Z> would
have reported a percentage rise in net profits "close to double
figures" rather than the actual two pct had it not been for
November's warehouse fire, a senior company official said.
    The official, who declined to be identified, told Reuters
Sandoz had made a substantial addition to reserves to cope with
the consequences of the accident at Schweizerhalle, which
caused severe pollution of the Rhine.
    Sandoz today reported without comment a rise in net profits
to 541 mln francs from the previous 529 mln and a five pct
increase in dividend to 105 francs per 250 franc nominal share.
    This year began well, with the performance in January and
February at least equal to the same period last year, the
official said.
    The company is expected to give fuller details of its
results at a news conference on April 22.
    Sandoz has insisted that it is adequately insured to cover
any liability arising from the accident.
    The official said the addition to reserves was to cover the
"one pct" of claims somehow not covered and any voluntary
gestures it wanted to compensate for the effects of pollution
from the fire.
    Sandoz has not given any figure for claims, which have been
flowing in from Switzerland and other countries bordering the
Rhine since the accident.
    However, the official said the final figure would be "much
less than that cited in earlier comments." He gave no further
details.
    In line with fellow chemical giant Ciba-Geigy &lt;CIGZ.Z>,
which reported last month, Sandoz profit and turnover were also
hit by the falling dollar, the official said.
    Sales in local currency terms were up by 14 pct, with
market share increases in the United States and Japan. But this
was more than offset by a 15 pct negative foreign exchange
effect, which produced the reported one pct drop in turnover to
8.36 billion francs,the Sandoz official said.
    Net profit at Ciba-Geigy dropped by 21 pct to 1.16 billion
francs, while sales fell by 12 pct to 15.95 billion francs.
    The third major Swiss chemical company, F. Hoffmann-La
Roche and Co &lt;HOFZ.Z> has not yet reported its results.

<TITLE>ALUSUISSE SEES POSSIBLE BREAK-EVEN IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Schweizerische Aluminimum AG &lt;ALUZ.Z>
(Alusuisse) may be able to break even this year after cleansing
its balance sheet for 1986, chief executive Hans Jucker said.
    "The threshold of profitability has returned to the
foreseeable future," he said. "We expect already in 1987
approximately to break even. That presupposes, however, that
our industrial environment does not worsen."
    He said Alusuisse would no longer face the burden of past
losses.
    Alusuisse made a net loss of 688 mln Swiss francs in 1986
after a restated 756 mln loss in 1985.
    Gross sales were 5.93 billion francs after 8.51 billion and
net turnover 5.65 billion after 8.00 billion.
    Alusuisse had originally reported a 692 mln francs loss for
1985.
    But Jucker and Finance Director Hermann Haerri told a news
conference the new management installed a year ago had decided
to restate the previous five years' accounts to eliminate
rights on Australian bauxite previously in the books as an
asset.
    Together with other one-off charges, Alusuisse took an
gross extraordinary charge in 1986 of 698 mln francs, up from
472 mln in 1985.
    It also had 106 mln extraordinary income in 1986 remaining,
after provisions, from the sale of its Maremont Corp subsidiary
in the United States. There were no extraordinary gains in
1985.
    Jucker said the losses, plus those carried forward from
1985, had wiped out the company's remaining reserves and
exceeded legally allowed levels, forcing Alusuisse to adopt a
50 pct capital cut, to be approved by shareholders on April 22.
    Jucker said he knew shareholders would find this "radical
elimination of the mortgages of the past" painful, but said the
foundation had been laid for a successful new company strategy.
    Haerri said despite the losses, the company's liquidity was
strong. Bank debt had been cut by about one-third to 2.56
billion francs against the end-1985 level of 3.85 billion.
    Cash flow improved substantially to 323 mln francs from 111
mln and represented 5.7 pct of turnover against a mere 1.4 pct
in 1985.
    In addition, to reassure other creditors, Alusuisse had
arranged with three major Swiss banks -- Union Bank of
Switzerland &lt;SBGZ.Z>, Swiss Bank Corp &lt;SBVZ.Z> and Credit
Suisse &lt;CRSZ.Z>, to convert 300 mln francs of credits into a
subordinated loan.
    The main sources of losses in 1986 were book losses and not
cash losses, Haerri said. Existing credit lines were used only
to a small extent, and the parent company had been granted a
new credit line of 200 mln francs from a consortium of Swiss
banks that would cover most of the loans falling due in 1987.
    Haerri said the company had been criticized for maintaining
bauxite rights as an asset, and so had restated the accounts.
    That left the 1985 account with a 756 mln franc loss
instead of 692 mln, 1984 with a 68 mln profit instead of 169
mln, 1983 with a 217 mln loss instead of 82 mln and 1982 with a
479 mln loss instead of 179 mln.
    The new accounts show 1985 with shareholders' equity of
1.15 billion francs instead of 1.75 billion, and similar
alternations were made for previous years.
    After 1986 losses, shareholder's equity stood at only 895
mln francs.

the October-December quarter rose four pct from a year earlier
to 5,654 billion yen against a 2.6 pct year-on-year rise in the
preceding quarter, the Finance Ministry said.
    The improved earnings resulted mainly from a 22.5 pct
profit increase in non-manufacturing industries, supported by
an 88.7 pct rise for construction firms and a 138 pct gain in
real estate, according to a ministry survey.
    Total sales of the 15,308 firms with capital of 10 mln yen
or more which responded to the poll, fell one pct to 217,217
billion yen against a 1.2 pct fall the previous quarter.
    Current profits of manufacturing industries in the fourth
quarter dropped 13.7 pct to 2,394 billion yen against a 22.1
pct fall in the preceding quarter, the ministry said.
    Plant and equipment investments of all firms polled fell
3.9 pct to 8,004 billion yen, compared with a 1.4 percent fall
the previoius quarter.
    Ministry officials said the survey showed that the Japanese
economy is in a delicate stage in which it is hard to tell if
economic growth has stopped deteriorating or if the economy is
heading for a recovery.

(Alusuisse) plans further drastic cuts in its aluminium
smelting capacity and more concentration of higher value-added
products, chief executive Hans Jucker said.
    Elaborating on plans disclosed in outline last September,
company officials said current smelting capacity of 390,000
tonnes a year would be cut to between 250,000 and 260,000
tonnes by 1989 or 1990. They did not say where cuts might be
made.
    Two years ago, before selling its Ormet Corp subsidiary in
the United States to local management and staff, Alusuisse had
an annual capacity of 800,000 tonnes.

    The Paris agreement was aimed at stopping a further rapid

    The accord stipulated that current rates reflect

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The cabinet has approved a bill making it
easier for the government to issue commemorative coins, a
Finance Ministry official said.
    The bill, which must still be approved by parliament, would
take effect in April 1988. It would allow the government to
issue 1,000, 5,000 and 10,000 yen coins without special
legislation, although higher-valued coins would still need a
special law, the official said. At present it can only issue
coins of 500 yen or less.

Hajime Tamura told a parliamentary session Japan's small- and
medium-sized enterprises are seriously suffering from the yen's

upon last month in Paris by six major industrial nations.
Finance ministers of Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S.

<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said
he sees the oil market continuing bullish, with underlying
demand expected to rise later in the year.
    He told a press conference in Jakarta at the end of a
two-day meeting of South-East Asian Energy Ministers that he
saw prices stabilizing around 18 dlrs a barrel.
    "The sentiment in the market is bullish and I think it will
continue that way as demand will go up in the third or fourth
quarters," Subroto said.
    Asked about the prospect for oil prices, he said: "I think
they will stabilise around 18 dlrs, although there is a little
turbulence ..."
    "Of course the spot price will fluctuate, but the official
price will remain at 18 dlrs," he added.

<TITLE>OPEC DEFENDING 18 DLR PRICE, SUBROTO SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said
OPEC is deliberately under its production ceiling of 15.8 mln
barrels to defend its 18 dlr a barrel price target.
    He told reporters at an energy conference in Jakarta that
OPEC had decided to maintain its price level of 18 dlrs.
    "We are deliberately defending the price, so OPEC production
is less than 15.8 (mln) at the moment," he stated.
    Asked if OPEC would increase production if prices went
above 18 dlrs a barrel, he said this would be decided at the
next OPEC meeting in June. "We will discuss the market situation
then," he added.
    He said a meeting of the OPEC Differentials Committee had
been postponed because "there is no need for the meeting."
    He did not elaborate. The committee had originally been due
to meet in Vienna this week.

rate movements in correcting international trade imbalances
appears to be waning, and long-term efforts are required to cut
Japan's chronic dependence on external demand, the Bank of
Japan said in a monthly report.
    Japan's trade surplus in nominal terms is likely to remain
high in the near future, the central bank said.
    Fundamental adjustments will be needed as long as Japan
hopes to benefit from a better international allocation of
resources and maintain the free trade system, it added.

    A basket is a local measure equal to 46 lbs.

    Burma's "Green Revolution" sparked by the introduction of
high-yield variety paddy strains in the mid-1970s appears to
have hit a plateau with production levelling off over the past
two years, economists said.

<TITLE>COURT PUTS INJUNCTION ON DUTCH PORT REDUNDANCIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROTTERDAM, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Employers in Rotterdam port's
strike-hit general cargo sector have been served with an
injunction until May 7 preventing them from continuing with
plans for 350 redundancies this year, an employers'
organisation spokesman said.
    An Amsterdam court yesterday ruled there had been a legal
fault in the employers' redundancy procedure.
    The employers' spokesman said they were likely to restart
the redundancy procedure afresh next week in an attempt to
pre-empt the May 7 final court ruling.
    Port and transport union representative Paul Rosenmuller
described the court ruling as a victory for the union, but
added there was still a long way to go before the dispute that
has hit the general cargo sector for the past eight weeks was
resolved.
    Rosenmuller said there would be a meeting of the sector's
4,000 workers this afternoon to decide on further action in the
campaign of lightning strikes that began on January 19 in
protest at planned redundancies of 800, starting with 350 this
year.
    The employers said there were no immediate plans for
meetings with the union either on the proposed redundancies or
on a new work practice agreement in the sector.
    Meanwhile, discussions on a new work agreement in the
port's grain sector, due to resume next week, are stalemated,
although agreement could be close in the coal and ore sector,
the employers' spokesman added.

    The consumer price index (base 1976) rose to 761.3 from

    This gave a year-on-year February inflation rate of 9.5 pct

    Measured as an annual average rate, inflation in February
was 11.1 pct compared with 11.4 pct in January.  The government
forecasts annual average inflation of about eight pct this
year.

<TITLE>U.S. PRODUCER PRICES RISE 0.1 PCT IN FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Producer Price Index for
finished goods rose 0.1 pct on a seasonally adjusted basis in
February, the Labor Department said.
    The increase came after a 0.6 pct increase in producer
prices in January.
    Higher energy prices were primarily responsible for the
increase in February, though they rose at a slower pace than
they had in January, the department said.
    The finished goods index was up 0.1 pct from its February,
1986 level.
    Before seasonal adjustment, the index for finished goods
stood at 292.3 over its 1967 base of 100.
    Among finished goods, the index for energy products rose
four pct in February after a 9.8 pct increase in January. But
price increases slowed sharply for gasoline and home heating
oil, the department said.
    There were some price declines, including a 3.4 pct fall
for passenger cars and 1.3 pct for light trucks from January
levels. This reflected expanded factory-financed rebates and
discount loan programs, the department said.

levels. This reflected expanded factory-financed rebates and
discount loan programs, the department said.
    The index for consumer foods fell 0.5 pct after a 1.8
pct drop in January as vegetables, pork and coffee cost less.
The index for intermediate goods rose 0.5 pct following a sharp
0.9 pct rise in January.
    The department said that energy prices again were the main
reason, with the index for intermediate energy up 2.7 pct.
    Gasoline and diesel fuel prices were about five pct higher,
half the 10 pct jump recorded in January.
    The durable manufacturing materials index edged down 0.1
pct last month after jumping 1.0 pct in January as prices for
steel, precious metals and copper stabilized.
    The department said lead and zinc prices fell, while
hardwood lumber and cement cost more. The crude materials index
rose 1.8 pct in February after a 2.9 pct rise in January. Crude
energy materials were up 2.6 pct, much less than the 10 pct
rise in January. Crude petroleum prices rose 4.4 pct last month
after a sharp 19.7 pct rise in January.
    Price rises accellerated for logs and timber and tobacco,
but fell for cotton, metal ores and copper and aluminum scrap.
    Among finished goods, gasoline rose 5.5 pct after a 15.7
pct January increase, and fuel oil was up three pct in February
after an 18.0 pct increase in January.

<TITLE>DREYER'S GRAND &lt;DRYR> RESTATES 4RTH QUARTER LOSS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OAKLAND, Calif., March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream said
it has restated its previously-reported fourth quarter loss to
904,000 dlrs or 13 cts per share because it has now decided to
take a charge of about 700,000 dlrs to provide for losses of
Midwest Distributing Co, which was acquired December 30.
    Dreyer's said the restatement reduces net income for the
full year to 5,914,000 dlrs or 80 cts per share.
    The company said the restatement does not indicate any
change in its thinking on the benefits of the acquisition or
future prospects in Midwest Distributing's markets.
    Dreyer's Grand previously reported 1986 earnings of
6,614,000 dlrs or 90 cts per share, down from 7,960,000 dlrs or
1.08 dlrs a share.  For the first nine months of the year, it
had earned 6,818,000 dlrs or 92 cts per share, up from
6,354,000 dlrs or 86 cts a share a year before.

<TITLE>JAPAN BROKERS SEEK 10 YEAR GOVERNMENT BOND AUCTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese securities houses have asked the
Finance Ministry again to consider introducing auctions of
10-year government bonds, securities sources said.
    Finance Ministry officials declined comment but said the
Ministry has been aware of growing calls from securities houses
for 10-year bond auctions.
    Japanese securities houses also may allow foreign brokers
to underwrite more 10-year bonds from April. Four U.S. Banks
are expected to receive Finance Ministry approval in late April
to operate securities subsidiaries in Japan as long as they
hold no more than 50 pct of the capital, bankers said.
    These firms are likely to join the syndicate, which will
increase the number of participants in the 10-year government
bond primary market, securities managers said.
    Each of the 17 current foreign securities houses in the
syndicate underwrites 0.07 pct of each issue, they said.
    In order to expand participation by foreigners, the
syndicate must either expand the securities industry's 26 pct
share or introduce auctions to the primary market, they said.
    Local brokers have requested the head of the syndicate, now
Fuji Bank Ltd, to increase their share to 30.7 pct but banks
oppose any cut in their 74 pct share, bankers said.

&lt;VOWG.F> spokesman said the group had no immediate comment on
reports of greater than expected losses at its Spanish
subsidiary Sociedad Espanola de Automoviles de Turismo (SEAT).
    German newspapers reported that Werner Schmidt, SEAT

losses for 1986 were around 27 billion pesetas, or about 386
mln marks, almost double original expectations.
    According to the Boersen-Zeitung newspaper, Schmidt said VW
would invest 42 billion pesetas in SEAT this year and in the
years to 1995 would spend 462 billion on its new Spanish unit.

<TITLE>U.S. URGES BANKS TO DEVELOP NEW 3RD WLD FINANCE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Torday</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States this week signaled
it is pressing commercial banks, increasingly disenchanted with
providing large cash loans to debtor nations, to develop new
ways of financing that will prove more acceptable to both
sides.
    Heading off challenges to its Third World debt strategy,
U.S. officials also say they think concessions should be made
to debtors that enact reforms speeding inflation-free growth.
    In particular, they stress new techniques that shift the
emphasis from debt to equity and shave interest rates.
    "The strategy is sufficiently broad as an initiative or
concept that there can be additional emphasis such as in
debt-equity swaps and that sort of thing," a Reagan
administration official said of the slow pace of commercial
bank lending to the Third World.
    "The debtors have been performing well...some people argue
that taking 1-1/8 pct down to 13/16 pct is debt forgiveness.
Well if that's what it is, fine. What it really is a narrowing
of the spread that could be charged on new money," the official
said.
    This week, therefore, U.S. officials signaled their backing
for a novel proposal by the Philippines that called for partial
payment of interest in tradeable investment notes.
    On Tuesday, officials said Treasury Secretary James Baker
told Secretary of State George Shultz the idea was a creative
one and signaled his approval to Philippine Finance Minister
Jamie Ongpin later that day. An administration official told
Reuters this week the Philippines' proposal to partially pay
interest with investment notes instead of cash should be
considered seriously by the banks. An agreement with the banks,
officials now say, is expected soon.
    "New bank lending has been slow in materializing but the
fact of the matter is there have been 70 billion dlrs in bank
loans restructured, which is a form of extension of credit. As
you know, there's been 8.5 billion dlrs in new money," said the
official, who plays a key role in keeping the plan afloat.
    The plan was launched in October 1985 by Secretary Baker
and called on commercial and multilateral banks to lend 29
billion dlrs in the subsequent three years to major debtors
undertaking reforms that promoting economic growth.
    But it has taken almost six months to complete the
syndication of a 7.5 billion dlrs loan to Mexico, which has
created deep misgivings here about the liklihood of such large
straight cash loans being assembled ever again.
    U.S. officials want the banks not only to consider swapping
their debts for equity in local corporations -- a development
that has already met with success in Chile and Mexico -- but to
pin loans on specific projects, finance trade and invest
directly in debtor country private sectors.
    These forms of lending, they say, give the banks a greater
stake and more economically secure return on investment.
    In a major challenge to the U.S. plan, Brazil last month
declared a moratorium on interest payments and followed it up
with a world tour by officials seeking a political way out of
its 109 billion dlr debt burden.
    The country is beset by a falling trade surplus and
dwindling reserves endangering its ability to service its
foreeign debt, at 109 billion dlrs the Third World's largest.
    One official attending the Washington talks with Brazilian
Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said "they've come in here now
and said "Look, we're out of money, help us," but they haven't
come in with a plan. And they've gone all over the world, and
at every stop they've been told the same thing."
    The official said Brazil would have to enact a credible
economic program, either in consultation with the World Bank or
the International Monetary Fund, to cool its overheated economy
before commercial banks would begin negotiations.
    As a result of the Brazilian action, private banks and
major debtor nations redoubled their efforts to reach
agreements stretching out debt repayments.
    For its part, the administration has signaled its strong
support for new techniques that in some cases effectively
amount to interest rate concessions for major debtor nations.
    It pressed the banks to allow Chile to make annual instead
of bi-annual interest payments, speeding an accord.
    Administration officials, who asked not to be named, have
also debated whether to allow banks greater flexibility in
building up loan loss reserves against Third World loans.
    The debate centers on a rule, known as FASB-15, under which
banks experiencing delayed interest payments on real estate
loans need not set aside reserves against debt principal if it
is believed payments will resume.
    More recently, the rule was extended to cover farm and
energy loans and Senator Bill Bradley, a New Jersey Democrat,
has suggested it should be extended to Third World loans.
    Bradley is prominent among Congressmen urging that
provisions for debt relief be attached to tough new trade
legislation now being considered on Capitol Hill.
    But the officials said the debate has been inconclusive.

<TITLE>OUTOKUMPU TO CLOSE NICKEL REFINERY DURING SUMMER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HELSINKI, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Finnish metal and mining group
Outokumpu Oy said it will close its nickel refinery at
Harjavalta in central Finland for six weeks in July and August
this year due to current low prices on the nickel market.
    "We consider nickel prices as bad at the moment, although
they have been rising slightly since January," refinery sales
manager Pekka Purra said.
    He said the closure will mean a drop in production of 3,000
tonnes in 1987 from last year's output of 17,800 tonnes. The
closure was also a move to cut labour costs as no extra staff
have to be employed during holidays to keep the plant open.

<TITLE>U.S. FEB INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION ROSE 0.5 PCT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. industrial production rose 0.5
pct in February after a revised 0.1 pct increase in January,
the Federal Reserve Board said.
    The Fed previously said industrial production rose 0.4 pct
in January.
    The Fed said the February gain was dominated by a sharp
rise in motor vehicle production, which boosted output of both
consumer goods and business equipment. Industrial production
stood at 127.3 pct of the 1977 average in February and was up
1.7 pct from a year ago, the Fed said.
    The Fed also revised the December industrial production
figure to a gain of 0.5 pct from 0.3 pct originally reported.
    Manufacturing output rose 0.5 pct in February after a 0.1
pct increase in January and included gains of 0.8 pct in
durables and 0.1 pct in non-durables, the Fed said.
    Manufacturing was 2.4 pct above the year ago level.
    Production of auto assemblies rose to an annual rate of 8.3
mln units last month from a January rate of 7.5 mln units.
    Output of consumer goods rose 0.6 pct after falling 0.3 pct
in January and output of consumer durables was up 2.1 pct in
February after falling by 2.0 pct in January.
    Business equipment production rose 1.0 pct in February,
reflecting more output of autos and trucks for business use and
a recovery from strikes in farm equipment industries, the Fed
said.
    Mining output rose 0.1 pct after a 1.6 pct increase in
January, but was still six pct lower than a year ago.
    Utilities output rose 0.7 pct in February after a 1.2 pct
rise in January.
    Output of defense and space equipment was up 0.4 pct, the
same as in January, and 6.2 pct higher than a year ago.
    Output of construction supplies rose 0.2 pct in February
after a 1.5 pct January rise.
    Materials output increased by 0.2 pct last month, the
fourth consecutive monthly increase after declining throughout
much of 1986. The recent strength in materials has been
concentrated in textiles, paper and chemicals, the Fed said.
    Output of home goods was up 0.3 pct in February and the Fed
said production of items like appliances and furniture
continued strong last month.

<TITLE>CAESARS WORLD &lt;CAW> REJECTS SOSNOFF'S OFFER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Caesars World Inc said its board
unanimously rejected a 28 dlr a share takeover offer by New
York investor Martin T. Sosnoff.
    Caesars said Sosnoff's offer to by all its outstanding
shares of common stock was inadequate and not in the best
interests of its shareholders.
    The company recommended that shareholders reject Sosnoff's
offer, made through his &lt;MTS Acquisition Corp>, and not tender
any of their shares.
    Caesars said it will explore a variety of alternative
transactions but did not elaborate.
    Caesars, in a brief statement, did not say whether it would
seek to buy back its shares held by Sosnoff.
    A Caesars spokesman said the company would not comment
further on its decision.
    On Wednesday, Sosnoff told the Securities and Exchange
Commission that he controls 13.6 pct of the company's stock.
    Sosnoff also informed the SEC that Caesars had offered to
buyout his holdings several times during the past year.
    No one from the Sosnoff organization was immediately
available for comment.
    Caesars said its financial advisor, Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc, had determined that Sosnoff's offer was financially
inadequate for shareholders other than Sosnoff.
    The company said other factors it considered in rejecting
the offer were its financial condition, future prospects,
current market conditions and the numerous conditions on which
Sosnoff's bid was conditioned.
    Caesars' stock opened up 1/8 point at 28-1/8. That is 1/8
point above Sosnoff's offer price.

    Negotiations between the union and employers, which are due

union refusing to accept sweeping changes in working hours and
practices in return for a 1.5 pct pay increase.
    The FNV spokesman said the action did not yet have official

<TITLE>DUTCH PORT UNION CALLS OFF GENERAL CARGO STRIKES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROTTERDAM, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dutch port and transport union, FNV,
has called off the strikes against planned redundancies that
have hit Rotterdam port's general cargo sector for the past
eight weeks, strike leader Paul Rosenmuller told a mass
meeting.
    The decision followed yesterday's ruling by an Amsterdam
court preventing the sector's employers continuing with current
plans for 350 redundancies this year until the court sits again
on May 7, Rosenmuller told a meeting of the general cargo
sector's 4,000 workers today.
    The court ruled the employers had made a mistake in the
complicated legal procedure for obtaining official permission
for the redundancies, and therefore could not proceed.
    "There is no need to continue the strikes for the moment now
the immediate pressure of redundancies has been lifted,"
Rosenmuller said.
    But he added that the strikes, which began on January 19 in
protest against plans for 800 redundancies by 1990, could
resume at any time before May 7 if the employers made any moves
to re-apply for permission for the redundancies.
    SVZ labour relations manager Gerrard Zeebregts said they
would be meeting their lawyers today with a view to re-applying
for this permission next week in the hope of gaining approval
for the redundancies within a month.

<TITLE>UGANDA RE-ROUTES COFFEE EXPORTS THROUGH KISUMU</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NAIROBI, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Long delays at the railway crossing on
the Kenyan border have led Uganda to re-route its coffee
exports through a ferry link with the Kenyan port of Kisumu
across Lake Victoria, Ugandan officials based in Kenya said.
    Uganda has a direct rail link with the Kenyan port of
Mombasa through which it conducts 70 pct of its external trade
but there is a chronic shortage of railway wagons, they said.
    Customs at Kisumu take less than a day compared with two to
three at the Malaba rail border crossing, a Ugandan Railways
official said. "Malaba is now handling only 10 pct of the trade
and all the coffee and oil goes through Kisumu," he said.
    However, an accident recently damaged the wagon ferry which
plies between Kisumu and the Ugandan port of Jinja, causing
bottlenecks on the lake route too.
    Sources at the Coffee Marketing Board in Kampala reported
delays in coffee export shipments last January due to
congestion on the lake ferries.
    Coffee accounts for about 95 pct of Uganda's export
earnings and last November President Yoweri Museveni ordered
all coffee shipments to be carried by rail in order to avoid
the higher costs of road haulage.

<TITLE>ALUSUISSE PLANS 50 PCT CAPITAL CUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Schweizerische Aluminium AG, Alusuisse,
plans to reduce share and participation certificate capital by
50 pct to cover losses in 1986 and those carried forward from
the previous year, chief executive Hans Jucker said.
    Jucker told a news conference that the greatest drain on
its financial resources had been stopped, but after
extraordinary charges the net loss of 688 mln francs in 1986
was only slightly under the 756 mln loss of the previous year.
    The losses in 1986 and those carried over from 1985 made it
necessary to reduce capital by 50 pct, he said.
    However, Jucker said the company improved liquidity through
a recovery in cash flow and conversion of 300 mln Swiss francs
of credit into a subordinated loan.
    Trading in Alusuisse shares was suspended on the Zurich
stock exchange after today's announcement by the company that
it would cut its share capital by 50 pct, the bourse said.
Trading would resume again on Monday.

<TITLE>CITICORP &lt;CCI> DENIES RUMORS OF DEBT WRITEDOWN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Citicorp denied financial market
rumors that it has written off some of its loans to Latin
American debtors,
    "Rumors that we have written off any of our Latin American
debt are unfounded," a Citicorp spokesman told Reuters in
response to London-based rumors in the money markets.
    Citicorp is the largest bank group in the U.S. and one of
the biggest lenders to Latin America, with some eight to nine
billion dlrs outstanding to Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, bank
analysts said.
    In response to more specific market rumors that it had
taken action on its exposure to Brazil, Citicorp said it made
an 8-K filing on the subject with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on Tuesday in relation to a registration statement
for a preferred stock issue.
    Citing the filing, Citicorp said that Brazil's recent
suspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of
commercial bank debt and related actions "may require Citicorp
to place 3.9 billion dlrs of intermediate and long-term
Brazilian loans on a cash basis."
    When loans are placed on a cash basis, interest or
principal payments are only booked when received instead of
being accrued on their due dates, analysts noted.
    However, Citicorp said in the 8-K filing that "it is
premature to make such a decision at this time in view of the
fluidity of the situation and management's high confidence in
the long-term outlook for Brazil."
    Brazil's new central bank governor Francisco Gros met
senior commercial bankers here on Wednesday and Citicorp said
formal talks on Brazil's recent actions and future financing
needs should begin in "the near future".
    Citicorp said in the filing, "the issue will be
re-evaluated at the end of the first quarter."
    The bank group continued, "if it is decided that these
loans to Brazil should be placed on a cash basis, Citicorp
estimates, based on existing interest rates, that the impact in
the first quarter would be approximately 50 mln dlrs after tax
and for the full year would be approximately 190 mln dlrs after
tax."
    It added that these amounts include interest accrued in
1986 that has not yet been collected.
    Although Citicorp denied earlier rumors of major loan
writedowns, its warning that it may have to place some of its
Brazilian loans on non-accrual unnerved many Wall Street
investors.
    The common stock price was down one dlr to 51-1/8 after the
first hour on a volume of over 500,000 shares.
    However, Lawrence Cohn, analyst at Merrill Lynch and Co
Inc, said that the market's nervousness was not really
warranted.
    "Citicorp can afford it," he said. "The amounts they are
talking about are peanuts."

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EMS MARKS EIGHTH BIRTHDAY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Tony Carritt, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Monetary System marks its
eighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money
markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability
in Europe, economists say. But many economists say the system,
which holds eight European Community currencies within narrow
fluctuation bands, remains in its infancy.
    Its new currency, the European Currency Unit (Ecu), has
been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike
seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar.
    And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu as
Europe's common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality
when Belgium minted the world's first Ecu coin.
    But economists say members such as West Germany have so far
blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system's
founding fathers, ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and
former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
    Under this phase, originally due to have started two years
after the EMS was set up, decision-making was to have been
transferred from national governments and central banks to an
autonomous European Monetary Fund.
   But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in
economic and monetary matters. "The basic problem of the EMS is
that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a
situation where certain decisions are taken in common," said one
economist who has closely watched the system's development.
    The result is that the EC is often divided over policy on
third currencies, accentuating what the economists say is the
system's greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar.
    Over the past 18 months, as the U.S. Dollar plunged and
investors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharp
rise of the West German mark severely strained the system. MORE
    As the mark soared against the dollar, it also rose against
EMS currencies less favoured by international investors. And as
West Germany last year refused to give in pressure from several
EC partners and the United States to cut interest rates to slow
the mark's rise, the EMS had to be realigned twice to ease
financial and trade strains within the community.
    Two months ago the mark and the Dutch guilder were revalued
by three pct and the Belgian and Luxembourg francs by two pct
against other currencies in the system -- the French franc,
Italian lira, the Irish punt and Danish crown.
   Another frustration has been Britain's failure to lend the
EMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major world
currency, outside the system.
    No change in the British government's attitude is expected
before the country's next general elections, due by mid-1988.
    Meanwhile, the system's last realignment, the 11th since it
was set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC's
highly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central
Bank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it.
    Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers
hold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month.
    But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve
more than tinkering with technical details. They are sceptical
about the chances for any fundamental change.
    "Technical measures won't be enough to protect the EMS
against external factors such as dollar weakness. For that we
must take the step forward to the institutional level," said Leo
de Corel of Kredietbank's economic research department.
    Economists say the system's fortunes now will depend
largely on the success of an agreement last month among major
industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates. If the dollar
resumes its slide the EMS could be in for more turbulence, they
predict.

<TITLE>GENERAL MILLS&lt;GIS> SEES STRONG 4TH QTR RESULTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MINNEAPOLIS, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>General Mills Inc, reporting
stronger results for the third quarter ended February 22, said
it expects the momentum to continue in the fourth quarter.
    The company said it expects to report "strong earnings per
share growth and a record return on equity in fiscal 1987." It
said this should be achieved despite expected non-operating
charges in the final quarter.
    General Mills said these charges will likely offset
non-operating gains, which included six cts a share in the
first half.
    General Mills said at the end of the third quarter, its
return on average equity was 31.6 pct.
    It said major factors contributing to the third quarter
improvement were an 11 pct gain in unit volume by Consumer
Foods, continuing good profit growth at Red Lobster USA and
strong performance in Specialty Retailing.
    The company reported quarterly earnings of 56.9 mln dlrs,
or 64 cts a share, up from 46.4 mln dlrs, or 52 cts a share a
year ago. Sales rose to 1.31 billion dlrs from 1.13 billion
dlrs. Year-ago data reflect a two-for-one common stock split.

<TITLE>HAITI ANNOUNCES FIND OF ORE-RICH GOLD FIELD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The  Ministry of Mines
has announced the discovery of a major gold field in Grand Bois
in Haiti's mineral-rich North.
    At a press conference yesterday, a Ministry spokesman
reported the deposit contained an estimated 44 mln tons of ore,
with each ton capable of containing 7,666 grams of gold. The
spokesman gave no estimate of what he thought the find,
discovered on Wednesday, was worth.
    However, mining could only begin after foreign partners
invest eight mln dlrs needed for technical equipment, the
spokesman said.
    The Haitian government has never before operated a gold
mine, but the United Nations has recently completed a three
year feasibility study which lists Grand Bois and Morne Bossa
as sites of important gold deposits.
    In 1971, the Sedren copper mine in Gonaives, operated by a
Canadian firm, closed down after years of mining a concentrate
containing gold as well as copper.
    "The new Grand Bois mine represents large amounts of money,"
said a former official of Sedren Mine.
    "But like everything else there's a catch. The gold has to
be extracted, and first someone has to come up with the money
to finance the operation," the official, who asked not to be
named, told Reuters.

<TITLE>NEW RUBBER PACT APPEARS IN THE BALANCE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GENEVA, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Negotiations on a new International
Natural Rubber Agreement, INRA, are approaching the
make-or-break point and prospects for a future pact appear to
be in the balance, delegates said.
    Manaspas Xuto of Thailand, chairman of the INRA
renegotiation conference, is holding consultations with a small
group of producers and consumers to try to resolve major
outstanding issues. When the talks began on Monday Xuto said
those issues should be settled by the end of the first week to
allow time to draft an agreement during the second week.
    The talks are due to last until March 20.
    Xuto said, "There is nothing concrete yet, but the
atmosphere is good." The discussions are expected to continue
late into the night, and Xuto said he may hold weekend
meetings.
    Delegates said negotiations now focus on the degree to
which price adjustments should be automatic.
    At present, if the market price has been above or below the
reference price (set at 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilo
in the current agreement) for six months, the reference price
is revised by five pct or by an amount decided by the
International Natural Rubber Organisation council.
    Consumers are asking that, in these circumstances, the
adjustment be automatic at five pct or more.
    Producers want the council to have the last word and have
resisted reducing its role in the price adjustment procedure.
    Delegates said there seems to be optimism about settling
another issue -- that of the floor price.
    It now appears that consumers may consider dropping their
insistence of a downward adjustment of the floor price, called
the "lower indicative price," under certain circumstances.
    This means that any possible compromise would centre on the
reference price, and the "may buy" (or "may sell") and "must buy" or
"must sell" levels, without changing the "lower indicative price"
-- which is set at 150 Malaysian/Singapore cents in the current
pact.
    Delegates said that in exchange for consumer flexibility on
the floor price question, producers may consider agreeing to
another consumer proposal for more frequent price reviews -- at
12 month intervals instead of 18 at present.

<DATELINE>   KANSAS CITY, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Soviet Union is rumored
this morning to have bought up to 1.5 mln tonnes of U.S. corn,
export trade sources said.
    The amount was not confirmed, but the talk was widespread
through the trade. Gulf cash barge basis levels jumped two to
three cents this morning on the rumors, which were expected to
boost futures prices on today's open.
    The Soviet Union recently bought over 1.0 mln tonnes of
U.S. corn, ostensibly as a conciliatory gesture ahead of trade
talks with U.S. agriculture officials.
    Purchases rumored today were seen as a positive factor in
light of a Soviet trade official's statement that the previous
purchase had satisfied near-term needs.

<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>France today repaid 21.95 billion francs
of short-term currency intervention debt to the European
Monetary Cooperation Fund, EMCF, the Finance Ministry said.
    It said the debt was part of a 33.90 billion franc
liability incurred through the activation of EMCF swap
facilities to defend the franc before the January 11 European
Monetary System realignment.
    The realignment, following several weeks of speculative
pressure, produced a three pct revaluation of the West German
mark and the Dutch guilder against the French franc and a two
pct revaluation of the Belgian franc.

<TITLE>WEST GERMAN RAILWAY ISSUES DOMESTIC STOCK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The West German federal railway is
raising 900 mln marks through a 10-year loan stock on the
domestic market with a coupon of 6-1/4 pct and price of par, a
Bundesbank spokesman said in response to enquiries.
    Some 750 mln marks will be offered for immediate sale with
75 mln held back for market regulation and the remaining 75 mln
placed with the railways own bank.
    The stock will be offered for sale between March 17 and 19
and will be listed on all German stock exchanges from March 20
to 24. The stock pays annual interest on April 1.
    Terms of the bond conformed with those expected earlier
today, dealers said.
    The bond rose in the first hour of grey market trading to
less 7/8, less 5/8, after being quoted at less 1-1/8, less 7/8
in first business.
    Dealers said demand rose owing to the bond's relatively
small size.
    In contrast, the last railway issue in January totalled 1.1
billion marks, of which 900 mln was distributed for immediate
sale.

yesterday announced his department will permit the importation
of 730 black Creole pigs, which had been banned from the island
nation since 1983.
    Between 1981 and 1983, a team of Canadian veterinarians
funded by the United States, Canada, Mexico and Costa Rica
supervised the slaughter of all Haiti's 1,200,000 pigs under a
program to eradicate African swine flu.
    Today's announcement that Catholic Relief Services
(CARITAS) can import 730 Jamaican pigs comes after months of
protests by farmers who had owned 90 pct of the slaughtered
pigs.

<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Soviet-West German trade is expected
to develop favourably due to Moscow's increasing openness to
East-West economic relations, Dresdner Bank AG's Moscow
representative Michael Stein said.
    He told a bank presentation the Soviet Union was last year
hit by the fall in world oil prices, which cut export revenue
from oil-related products and natural gas, and its overseas
buying power was also adversely affected by the lower dollar.
   Dresdner Bank economist Alfred Apholte said the Soviet
Union's large currency and gold reserves had softened the
impact of the dollar weakening and oil price drop.

<TITLE>BENEFICIAL &lt;BNL> DOWNGRADED BY MOODY'S</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Moody's Investors Service Inc said it
downgraded 3.4 billion dlrs of debt of Beneficial Corp.
    Cut to Baa-2 from Baa-1 were the senior debt of the company
and the guaranteed debt of its unit, Beneficial Overseas
Finance NV.
    Also downgraded were Beneficial's shelf registrations of
senior debt to Provisional Baa-2 from Provisional Baa-1 and of
subordinated debt to Provisional Ba-1 from Provisional Baa-3.
    Moody's said the magnitude of Beneficial's 1986 operating
losses from write-downs of discontinued businesses has weakened
its financial position.
    "The costs of meeting the potential liability for insurance
losses to facilitate the sale of the company's insurance unit
and of revaluing other discontinued business segments have
substantially exceeded original indications," Moody's said in a
release.
    The agency said Beneficial's consumer finance business
remains strong and has the capacity to withstand foreseeable
adverse developments.
    But the withdrawal from nontraditional businesses is
weakening consolidated leverage, narrowing funding operations
and depressing the quality of earnings, Moody's stressed.

    The agency also assigned an initial rating of B-1 to the
company's 90 mln dlrs of senior subordinated notes due 1997.
    Moody's said the action reflected increased leverage and

Southdown's repurchase of 28 pct of its common stock and the
financing of that transaction by debt.
    Moody's said the lower ratings anticipate certain debt
reduction in the coming year from the sale of assets.

<TITLE>U.S. FARM LOAN SECONDARY MARKET GAINS SUPPORT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Greg McCune, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, MARCH 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Proposals for a secondary market for
the resale of farm real estate loans similar to home mortgage
markets is gaining support in Congress and among rural lenders
and could be established this year, Congressional and financial
sources said.
    Several bills which would establish a farm secondary market
have been introduced in both the House and Senate. Furthermore,
Representatives of the Farm Credit System, commercial bankers
and life insurance companies are meeting in an attempt to agree
on a method of establishing the market.
    Frank Naylor, chairman of the Farm Credit Administration
(FCA), which regulates the farm credit system, yesterday said a
farm loan secondary market would be positive for agriculture
"as long as the farm credit system is a key player."
    Naylor told a House Agriculture subcommittee hearing the
secondary market could be established either with Congressional
legislation or administratively.
    Any farm loan secondary market would be modeled after the
successful resale markets in home mortgages, the Government
National Mortgage Association (GNMA) and the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), industry sources said.
    Commercial banks and life insurance companies are the main
supporters of a farm loan secondary market because they believe
it would allow private lenders to compete more effectively in
rural lending with the quasi-government farm credit system,
traditionally the largest lender to farmers.
    A farm secondary market would allow lenders to sell
high-quality loans on farmland to "poolers" who in turn would
package the loans and issue farm mortgage-backed securities for
resale to investors-- called Aggie-mae by some supporters.
    However, the FCA and financially-troubled farm credit
system have in the past been ambivalent about the idea.
    The ambivalence is because any farm secondary market
established in the private sector that excluded the farm credit
system would put the system at a competitive disadvantage. That
could be a financial blow to the system, which has lost 4.6
billion dlrs in two years, Naylor and farm credit system
officials have said.
    A study commissioned by one of the main supporters of the
secondary market idea, the American Council of Life Insurers,
concludes the farm credit system's market share in rural
lending would fall if a secondary market were established. The
study was released earlier today.

<TITLE>SALOMON INC &lt;SB> SAID TO CUT U.S. BANKS RATINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, MARCH 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Salomon Inc has lowered its investment
ratings on all U.S. money center banks, institutional sources
said.
    The sources said Salomon believes that other money center
banks may feel compelled to follow Citicorp's &lt;CCI> lead
in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
relating to its loan exposure to Brazil.
    They also said Salomon believes that other banks may
strongly consider the possibility of placing Brazilian loans on
a non-accruing status with the consequent negative impact on
earnings.
    The sources said the ratings were lowered to M from O-plus.
The stock are now expected to match the Standard and Poor's 500
Index, rather than outperform the index as previously expected.
    The sources said it is also understood that the change in
the coding of these stocks should definitely not be taken as a
sell-recommendation because Salomon is said to believe that its
downgrading will only prove temporary.
    The banks affected by the change in investment coding are
Bank of New York Co Inc &lt;BK>, Bankers Trust Co &lt;BT>, Chase
Manhattan Corp &lt;CMB>, Chemical New York Corp &lt;CHL>, Citicorp
&lt;CCI>, Irving Bank Corp &lt;V>, Manufacturers Hanover Corp &lt;MHC>,
J.P. Morgan and Co Inc &lt;JPM>, Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM>,
Republic New York Corp &lt;RNB>, Bank of Boston Corp &lt;BKB> and
First Chicago Corp &lt;FNB>.
    The institutional sources said that Thomas Hanley, a
director of Salomon Inc subsidiary Salomon Brothers who is in
charge of bank stock research, believes Citicorp's move is
well-timed.
    Should Citicorp actually place the Brazilian loans in a
non-performing category at the end of this quarter this action
would serve to alleviate the urgency associated with the debt
negotiations, he argues.
    Thus Citicorp's bargaining position would appear to have
been much enhanced.

<TITLE>PETROBRAS ASKS ARMY TO WITHDRAW TROOPS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, MARCH 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil's state-oil company
Petrobras has asked the Army to withdraw the troops which were
occupying its oil installations since Tuesday, Petrobras said
in a statement.
    The statement said the request for the withdrawal of the
troops was made because of the calmness reigning in all of its
refineries.
    "The request was also due to the end of the seamen's strike
and the willingness of the oil industry workers to sit again by
the negotiating table," the statement said.
    Even though the Petrobras statement said the seamen's
strike was over, a union spokesman said only two small shipping
companies had reached a pay agreement. The overwhelming
majority of Brazil's seamen remained on strike.
    The statement said a meeting between Petrobras and oil
industry leaders was set for next Wednesday in Rio, with the
presence of Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto as a mediator.
    Petrobras said the request for the withdrawal of the troops
was made at 1100 local hours (1400 GMT), but a company
spokesman said he did not know if the troops had already been
removed.

<TITLE>GERMAN SECURITIES MAY BE COUNTED IN LENDING RATIOS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German banking authorities are
considering requiring German banks to bring securities holdings
into lending ratio calculations used to regulate credit risk,
banking sources said.
    The present interpretation of the credit law limits banks'
maximum lending to 18 times eligible capital -- reserves plus
equity capital -- but sets no restraints on securities
holdings.
    Under new provisions, weightings would be attached to
securities similar to those used for lending. Weightings would
range from a zero rating for no-risk assets to 100 pct of total
asset value for what authorities consider the highest risk.
    Low-risk securities carrying a zero rating would include
public authority bonds for the federal government, states and
municipalities, the sources said.
    A 20 pct rating would be assigned to issues of domestic
banks. Secured bonds of mortgage, shipping and public authority
banks would be an exception to this, via such securities as
mortgage and municipal bonds.
    Securities issued by foreign banks would attract a
weighting of 50 pct, while authorities are considering
requiring banks to include 100 pct of the value of debt assets
of foreign issuers, including sovereign borrowers.
    The sources said the revision is still being discussed, and
required approval by the federal Banking Supervisory Office in
West Berlin, the Bundesbank, and West Germany's four banking
associations.
    The move is a response to the increasing securitisation of
debt markets, they added.

<TITLE>PROGRESS IN IRAN LOAN TALKS, FRENCH OFFICIAL SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Talks between France and Iran on the
repayment of a one billion dlr loan by the late Shah have made
progress, Roland Dumas, head of a parliamentary Foreign Affairs
Committee said.
    "They are progressing as far as I have heard," Dumas told
reporters. "The two delegations appear to be near an agreement
on the figures."
    Dumas, a close aide to President Francois Mitterrand,
earlier this week met Iranian Charge d'Affaires in Paris
Haddadi Gholam-reza.
    The report of progress contrasts with official French
statements last month after talks between Deputy Iranian
Finance Minister Mehdi Navvab and the French Finance Ministry.
    The talks, the latest round in long-running negotiations
between the two countries, were said to have led to little
progress on the loan repayment issue.
    France made a first repayment of 330 mln dlrs last
November. Since then negotiatiors have shuttled between Tehran
and Paris for talks which France hopes will help secure freedom
for hostages held by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon.
    Iran is claiming full repayment of principal and interest
on the Shah's loan, made in 1975 to the EURODIF uranium
enrichment consortium. It has also asked France to curb the
activities of Iranian dissidents in France and stop selling
weapons to Iraq, its enemy in the Gulf War.
    France for its part has made a counter claim for more than
500 mln dlrs in compensation for contracts with French firms
broken after the 1979 revolution.

ratings on outstanding senior debt of Baker International Corp
and Hughes Tool Company.
    The change affects 515 mln dlrs in debt and assumes a
merger of the two companies will be completed.
    Baker's senior debt was downgraded to DP-8 (high BBB) from
DP-7 (low A).
    Hughes senior debt was raised to DP-8 from DP-12 (middle
BB) while subordinated debt was raised to DP-9 (middle BBB)
from DP-14 (high B).
    The debt ratio of the combined compaies will be about 40
pct but available cash plus proceeds from the sale of assets
will permit a prompt reduction in debt, Duff and Phelps said.
    However, fixed charge coverages will remain very thin until
the company's markets improve, D and P said.

Yeutter said that whether the exchange rate of the dollar would
fall or rise in the coming decade would depend on nations'
financial, monetary and tax policies.
    But, he said, in a speech and remarks to the Heritage
Foundation, that in the end "the marketplace will ultimately
rule the day."
    Asked about the future of the dollar, he said that whether
or not it would rise or fall depended on economic policies and
coooperation among trading nations.
    Yeutter said "if nations do the right kinds of things in
financial, monetary and tax policies, then a lesser burden of
adjustment is placed on exchange rates, and one could envision
a situation of the major trading nations moving back far closer
to what most of us would consider equilibrium and exchange
rates becoming relatively stable."
    But he said, on the other hand, that if nations did not
exhibit greater self discipline and international cooperation,
"It is simply inevitable that the exchange rates will make that
adjustment."

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Metropolitan Consolidated Industries
Inc, a New York paint company, said it has acquired 278,709
shares of Metex Corp, or 21.2 pct of the total, and left open
the possibility that it might acquire more through a merger.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Metropolitan said it bought the Metex stock as an investment.
    It also said it may buy additional shares, or sell some or
all of its current stake. If it buys more shares, Metropolitan
said it would consider doing so in the open market, in private
deals, or through an exchange offer, tender offer or merger.
    Metropolitan said it may acquire an option on or may buy
some or all of the Metex shares owned by William Hack, a Metex
director, who, together with this wife, holds 149,750 of the
company's common shares, or 11.4 pct of the total.
    Metropolitan said it already has an option to buy another
42,750 Metex common shares at 11.25 dlrs each. The option is
not exercisable until April 12, 1988, it said.
    If Metropolitan were to exercise the option and acquire all
of Hack's stake, it would have 471,208 Metex common shares, or
35.9 pct of the total. Metropolitan's SEC filing was
made as a shareholder group with Hack.
    Metropolitan, which said it spent 3.1 mln dlrs to acquire
its Metex stake, listed its recent stock purchases as 54,993
common shares on March 67 at 10 dlrs each and 83,916 shares on
March 11 at 11.25 dlrs.

<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bally Manufacturing Corp said it is
considering the sale of its Six Flag theme amusement park unit
and would use the proceeds to pay off debt.
    In addition to the possible sale of the amusement parks,
Bally plans to sell a minority stake in its health club chain
to the public. The company will register a proposed offering
with the Securities and Exchange Commission for 20 to 30 pct of
the health clubs soon, spokesman William Peltier told Reuters.
    "Selling Six Flags is definitely under consideration,"
Peltier said in response to an inquiry. He said the company
would use much of the income from the amusement park chain,
were it to be sold, to repay debt.
    Six Flags might sell for as much as 300 mln dlrs, analysts
said. The health club chain, the nation's largest, is valued at
350 to 375 mln dlrs, they said.
    Bally reportedly already has been approached about Six
Flags by several prospective buyers.
    The company needs the cash to begin paying back a 1.6 mln
dlrs mountain of debt.
    Bally recently completed a 439 mln dlrs acquisition of the
Golden Nugget casino hotel in Atlantic City from Golden Nugget
Inc &lt;GNG.N>.
    The purchase pushed its long-term debt to 1.6 billion dlrs,
or almost 2.7 times its equity of 600 mln dlrs.
    Bally's 325-unit health and tennis clubs had revenues in
1986 of more than 450 mln dlrs, or about 28 pct of Bally's
total revenues of 1.64 billion dlrs.
    Bally acquired Six Flags for 147.4 mln dlrs in January 1982
from Penn Central Corp. Bally bought the Great America theme
park in Gurnee, Ill., in May 1984 for 113.2 mln dlrs from
Marriott Corp &lt;mhs>.
    In 1986 the parks had pretax operating profit of 48.6 mln
dlrs on revenues of 369.4 mln dlrs.
    The clubs and equipment unit combined to post operating
profit of 60.4 mln dlrs on revenues of 475.6 mln dlrs in 1986,
of which 456.2 mln came from the clubs.
    The company earlier this month said it will take a charge
to earnings in the first quarter of 17.3 mln dlrs as a result
of its deal to buy back 2.6 mln of its common shares from real
estate developer Donald Trump.
    Under a February 21 deal, Bally agreed to buy the 2.6 mln
of the 3.06 mln shares held by Trump at 24 dlrs a share, or
62.4 mln dlrs, plus 6.2 mln dlrs related expenses in exchange
for Trump not seeking control of the company for 10 years.
    The deal also requires Bally to buy Trump's remaining
shares for 33 dlrs a share if the stock price does not reach
that level by February 21, 1988.

<TITLE>CUBA SUGAR CROP SEEN AT LEAST SAME AS LAST YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cuban sugar export figures for January
suggest that this year's crop may be at least as large as last
year's 7.35 mln tonnes, according to sugar analysts.
    Exports in January totalled 733,000 tonnes raw value, up
from 725,000 a year earlier, according to figures received by
the International Sugar Organization.
    January is the first major export month and the figures
thus give a good indication of the current crop, they said.
Fourth quarter exports fell to 622,000 tonnes from 909,000
tonnes a year earlier, but this was because Cuba was destocking
at the end of 1985, they added.
    Trade house C Czarnikow recently estimated production this
year at 7.50 mln tonnes.
    Cuban sugar production in the third quarter of 1986 was
12,000 tonnes, giving a final 1985/86 crop total of 7.35 mln
tonnes, compared with a 1984/85 crop of 8.10 mln tonnes.
    There is normally no third quarter production in Cuba, but
a hurricane meant that last year's crop was extended.
    Exports to the USSR were substantially down in January at
362,000 tonnes from 489,000 in January 1986, but other Comecon
countries received 210,000 tonnes, against 80,000 tonnes in the
same month last year, figures received by the ISO show.
    Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Romania all took
substantially more Cuban sugar.
    Cuba's November 1986 exports totalled 158,000 tonnes,
compared with 190,000 tonnes in 1985, and December's total was
237,000 tonnes, down from 518,000 tonnes the year before.
Calendar year exports for 1986 were also lower at 6.69 mln
tonnes against 7.21 mln in 1985 -- the lowest level since
1980's 6.19 mln tonnes, the figures show.

<TITLE>U.S. CONSERVATION SIGNUP SEEN 10 TO 12 MLN ACRES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Grain traders and analysts look for a
10 to 12 mln acre sign-up in the USDA's conservation reserve
program, scheduled to be announced after 1400 CST today.
    The USDA probably will accept about 80 to 90 pct of the
acres submitted, they said.
    Total enrollment in the first three years of the program is
only 8.9 mln acres, so the sharp increase expected this year
has underpinned new crop corn futures all week.
    However, some analysts said a 10 to 12 mln acre sign-up may
end up being negative to new crop corn prices, citing trade
talk earlier this year that 14 to 15 mln acres may be submitted
by farmers. Also, acres set-aside under the conservation
program are by definition poor yielding, so the impact on total
corn production will be minimal, they added.

<TITLE>MOBIL &lt;MOB> LONG TERM DEBT DOWN IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, MARCH 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Mobil Corp made a 15 pct reduction in
its long term debt in 1986 from the previous year according to
data in its 1986 annual report.
    Mobil chairman, Allen E. Murray said in his report to
shareholders, "that lower debt and our strong cash and
marketable securities position improves Mobil's flexibility."
    Long term debt as of December 31, 1986 was put at 7.9
billion dlrs, down 15 pct from 9.3 billion dlrs on the same day
in 1985.
    Mobil has moved to reduce debt at high interest rates,
which may reduce interest payments.
    Murray said that with the results from 1986, "we're paying
back 3.8 billion dlrs in the past two years, or the equivalent
of 66 pct of the debt incurred in 1984 when we bought Superior
Oil."
    Mobil said that it has about 183 mln dlrs of long term debt
which is due in 1987 although this will rise appreciably to 1.2
billion dlrs of long term debt due in 1988.
    At the end of 1986, Mobil said it also had an existing
effective shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange
Commmission to permit the sale of 205 mln dlrs of debt.
   Mobil's debt reduction program has also been abetted by
several steps taken by the company to restructure its
operations.
    Mobil's Murray said in his remarks to shareholders that the
company was continuing to dispose of assets which did not fit
the company's long range plans and had realized some 1.1
billion dlrs from the sale of its Container Corp subsidiary.
    Murray said that as a result of lower debt and more
efficient operations "the company is now is a position to seize
opportunities that may become available and use this strength
in whatever way best builds shareholder value."

Inter-American Development Bank, warned that if Latin countries
were unable to speed up their economic growth, then in the long
run there would be a default.
    He told a press conference foreshadowing the bank's annual

repaid. But to achieve that, the countries need to grow. If
they don't, then in the long run there will be a default."
    Ortiz Mena warned that Latin America needed to reverse the
capital outflows from the region and beyond that needed more
resources.
    Ortiz Mena declined to agree with estimates that capital
outflows from Latin America last year totaled 35 billion dlrs
and that therefore he was calling for an inflow into the region
above that sum.
    He said the U.S. debt strategy, which envisaged stepped up
lending by commercial and multilateral banks to major debtor
nations of 29 billion dlrs over three years, was insufficient
to achieve the necessary rates of growth.
    But he did stress the U.S. plan was important and the right
approach.
    Ortiz Mena said, "It is in the interest of the creditors,
not only the debtors, to push forward the development process
in Latin America and that has happened."
    He added, "The only problem is the resources have not been
enough."
    Turning to Brazil, whose growth rate he predicted will
decline slightly this year from 1986, Ortiz Mena said the
country's moratorium was the right action in order to avert a
long term default.
    "So it's preferable they negotiate now," a move which would
eliminate any chance of panic in the markets.
    Ortiz Mena also said that Brazilian authorities have opened
negotiations already with commercial banks.
    He pointed out Brazil took the action because of its
deteriorating economic situation.

<TITLE>CYCLOPS &lt;CYL> WILL NOT GIVE DATA TO GROUP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PITTSBURGH, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cyclops Corp said its board rejected
a request by Cyacq Corp, an investor group, for more non-public
information about Cyclops, a maker of specialty steels and an
electronics retailer.
    Cyclops cited its agreement to be acquired by Britain's
Dixons Group PLC for 90.25 dlrs a share under a tender offer
that expires midnight March 17.
    Cyacq, comprising Audio/Video Affiliates Inc, Citicorp
Capital Investors Ltd and other investors, yesterday said it
would increase its tender offer for Cyclops to 92.50 dlrs a
share from 80 dlrs, subject to certain conditions.
    The conditions were that Cyclops provide Cyacq with
non-public data given to Dixons and that Cyacq be satisfied
with financial projections made by Dixons in its offer.
    Cyclops also said its board determined that Cyacq's
announcement was not an offer. "Cyacq's press release does not
amend Cyacq's outstanding tender offer which remains at 80 dlrs
per share and it does not state that Cyacq has financing
commitments necessary to carry out its original offer or any
increased offer that it may make," Cyclops said in a statement.
    Its agreements with Dixons are binding and Dixons indicated
it will not rescind or waive any provisions of the pacts,
Cyclops said.
    The company also said it was advised that Dixons'
shareholders approved the merger, satisfying that condition of
the agreement.

<TITLE>USSR HEAVY BUYERS OF YUGOSLAV CORN-U.S. REPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Soviet Union has been a heavy
buyer of Yugoslav corn since October, purchasing close to 1.5
mln tonnes in the 1986/87 marketing year, according to a report
from the U.S. agriculture counselor in Belgrade.
    Approximately 1.5 mln tonnes of Yugoslav corn have already
been committed to foreign buyers for 1986/87, with most of this
sold to the Soviet Union, the Yugoslav Grain Association
reported to the U.S. official.
    In a report dated March 10, the official said that about
800,000 tonnes of the corn has been delivered, with the balance
of 700,000 tonnes to be shipped between now and June.
    An additional 500,000 tonnes of corn can be shipped from
July-September, the grain associaiton said, so total Yugoslav
corn exports could reach 2.0 mln tonnes, the counselor said.
    Heavier than normal monthly shipping rates for Yugoslav
corn exports are due to the increased use of river barges for
exporting corn to the Soviet Union, the counselor said.
    Monthly corn shipments out of Yugoslavia have averaged
around 160,000 tonnes since October 1, higher than earlier
estimates of 150,000, the official said.
    The Soviet Union has taken an increased share of Yugoslav
corn sales during this marketing year, he said.

<TITLE>U.S. MAKES CONCILIATORY MOVE AT RUBBER PACT TALKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GENEVA, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Has dropped its insistence that
the floor price in a new International Natural Rubber
Agreement, INRA, be revised downward under certain
circumstances, conference sources said.
    The surprise conciliatory move by the U.S. Meets one of the
producers' main concerns -- that the floor price, or "lower
indicative price," remain unchanged, they said.
    It is not clear, however, whether all consuming countries
will follow suit, as a number of them, in particular Britain,
West Germany and Belgium, appeared to have strong reservations,
the sources added.
    The group of consumers has been seeking an adjustment of
the "lower indicative price" (set at 150 Malaysian/Singapore
cents a kilo in the present pact) if the buffer stock,
currently 360,000 tonnes, rises to 450,000 tonnes.
    The sources said the question of to what extent price
adjustments should be automatic remains a problem.
    Conference chairman Manaspas Xuto of Thailand has been
holding consultations with producers and consumers throughout
the day.
    The consumers' group is now holding a separate meeting
ahead of further consultations within the "president's group"
tonight.

<TITLE>FED SEEN CONTENT WITH U.S. FEBRUARY ECONOMY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Kathleen Hays, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. February reports reflecting slim
gains in industrial output and moderating inflation pressures
reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue
to follow a stable course of monetary policy, economists said.
    "If you're the Fed, there's no reason to do anything," said
Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities Inc.
    "There are hints that GNP is picking up. On the inflation
front, all is well," he said. "Money supply is well under
control. It's an absolutely ideal situation."
    February U.S. industrial production rose 0.5 pct, slightly
less than the 0.7 pct gain the financial markets had expected.
This compared with a slim 0.1 pct rise in January's production
number, previously reported as a 0.4 pct increase.
    The February U.S. producer price index gained only 0.1 pct,
less than a 0.3-0.4 pct expected rise. This followed a 0.6 pct
rise in the PPI in January.
    "The Fed is going to look at this positively," said Allan
Leslie of Discount Corporation. "Certainly inflation is not as
bad as what Volcker (Fed Chairman) has said lately. Industrial
production growth is along the lines of what the Fed wants."
    The energy products component of PPI rose 4.0 pct in
February, after a 9.8 pct increase in January.
    "This shows that the impact of energy prices on inflation
is behind us in terms of the move from 15 dlrs to 18 dlrs per
barrel," said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. "The
trend is still 3.5 pct in the first half of the year."
    In 1986, declining energy prices contributed to a 2.5 pct
decline in the PPI.
    Economists said that a rise in energy prices was expected,
but a sharp drop in auto prices was not. Passenger car prices
fell 3.4 pct and light truck prices dropped 1.3 pct.
    Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said that
a possibility of renewed inflation remains a concern in both
the financial markets and the Federal Reserve.
    "The Fed may be lowering its own inflation expectations
today," said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International.
    While low inflation permits the Fed to maintain an easier
monetary policy, Brusca said if import prices do not rise this
could necessitate a weaker dollar.
    "The outlook for the dollar is still up in the air," he
said. "We need inflation for U.S. producers to compete with
foreign producers."
    Brusca said prices of electronic equipment dropped 0.8 pct
in February's PPI. With many electronic goods produced
overseas, this may show that foreign producers are not raising
prices which bodes ill for U.S. competitiveness, he said.
    If further dollar declines are needed, this could diminish
overseas investment in U.S. debt, Brusca added, which might
necessitate higher interest rates and lower bond prices.
    By contrast, Slifer said imported goods prices rose 11.8
pct from first quarter 1985 to first quarter 1986 reflecting to
a large degree a 22 pct drop in the trade-weighted real value
of the dollar from February 1985 to February 1987.
    Slifer said import prices may rise further as
manufacturers' contracts put in place before the dollar dropped
to current levels expire, and new contracts are made that
reflect a weaker dollar.
    David Wyss of Data Resources Inc noted that imported
manufactured goods prices rose 8.5 pct at an annual rate in the
second half of 1986, which has contributed to rising U.S.
industrial output.
    "It's the other side of the lower dollar," Wyss said.
"Producers are beginning to find themselves more competitive
and they are increasing output."
    Wyss said that the latest data point to an average
industrial production gain of 0.3-0.4 pct in the first quarter.
"It's an encouraging sign that the manufacturing sector is
beginning to revive."
    But Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc was not 
convinced that the February reports portend economic gains. He
said much of the strength came from factors that do not point
to a sustained rise in industrial output.
    Roach pointed out that stikers returning to work in farm
equipment industries helped account for a one pct rise in
February business equipment production.
    Utilities output rose 0.7 pct in February after gaining 1.2
pct in January, but Roach said it shows mostly that more energy
was produced, not that manufacturing activity gained.
    Finally, he pointed out that auto production accounted for
half of the industrial production gain as production of auto
assemblies rose to 8.3 million units at an annual rate from 7.5
million units.
    "In the first quarter, it looks like automakers are
producing at an 8.5 mln unit annual rate, but selling at
roughly a seven mln unit rate," Roach said. "The disparity
between output and sales is showing up in inventories."
    Economists pointed to sharp rise in January U.S. business
inventories as a sign that production may be outstripping
demand in the first quarter of 1987.
    January business inventories rose 0.9 pct, the largest gain
since July 1979 when inventories rose 1.7 pct, the Commerce
Department said. Business sales dropped 4.5 pct in January, the
largest monthly sales drop on record.
    Nonetheless, economists do not expect the Fed to react to
month-to-month changes. "The Fed has been standing pat for the
last seven months," Ramirez said. "They will continue to stand
pat for at least the next couple of months."

<TITLE>U.S. FARM LOAN SECONDARY MARKET GAINS SUPPORT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Greg McCune, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>A secondary market for resale of
farm real estate loans similar to markets on home mortgages is
gaining support in Congress and among rural lenders and could
be set up this year, Congressional and financial sources said.
    Several bills which would establish a farm secondary market
have been introduced in both the House and Senate. Furthermore,
Representatives of the Farm Credit System, commercial bankers
and life insurance companies are meeting in an attempt to agree
on a method of establishing the market.
    Frank Naylor, chairman of the Farm Credit Administration,
FCA, which regulates the farm credit system, yesterday said a
farm loan secondary market would be positive for agriculture
"as long as the farm credit system is a key player."
    Naylor told a House Agriculture subcommittee hearing the
secondary market could be established either with Congressional
legislation or administratively.
    Any farm loan secondary market would be modeled after the
successful resale markets in home mortgages, the Government
National Mortgage Association, GNMA, and the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), industry sources said.
    Commercial banks and life insurance companies are the main
supporters of a farm loan secondary market since they believe
it would allow private lenders to compete more effectively in
rural lending with the quasi-government farm credit system,
traditionally the largest lender to farmers.
    A farm secondary market would allow lenders to sell
high-quality loans on farmland to "poolers," who in turn would
package the loans and issue farm mortgage-backed securities for
resale to investors -- called Aggie-mae by some proponents.
    The FCA and financially-troubled farm credit system have in
the past been ambivalent about the idea, mainly because any
farm secondary market established in the private sector which
excluded the farm credit system would put the system at a
competitive disadvantage and could be another financial blow to
the system, which has lost 4.6 billion dlrs in two years,
Naylor and farm credit system officials have said.
    However, the system and FCA have become more positive to
the idea recently because the system could benefit if it were
appointed the agent for a secondary market.
    "If the farm credit system were the guarantor of the pools
of farm mortgage loans, it would benefit from the fees charged
for providing this service," the Life Insurers' study said.
    Congressional sources believe a secondary market available
to both private lenders and the farm credit system, with the
system as agent, could be included in a major federal
government rescue package for the system to be drafted by
Congress later this year.
    A study commissioned by one of the main supporters of the
secondary market idea, the American Council of Life Insurers,
concludes that the farm credit system's market share in rural
lending would fall if a secondary market were established.
    The study was released earlier today.
    The study said a secondary market could be established with
virtually no federal money if the government provided a
guarantee of 90 pct of the farm loans but a private
co-insurance plan guaranteed the first 10 pct of any losses.
    It estimated between 500 mln and two billion dlrs of the
eight billion in new farm real estate loans issued each year
would qualify for the secondary market in the first few years,
expanding significantly later as investors accept the idea.
    The study also said interest rates charged to farmers who
meet the underwriting standards of a secondary market would
fall 50 to 100 basis points due to the new resale market.
    The possible interest rate declines are a major reason why
leading U.S. farm organizations such as the American Farm
Bureau Federation have recently endorsed the idea.
    Proponents say a secondary market also would increase
liquidity in farm lending, and spread the risk of such loans.

<TITLE>ECUADOR UNABLE TO SERVICE DEBT - CENTRAL BANK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Quito, march 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>ecuador cannot service its debt owed to
private foreign banks due to the earthquake that forced a
suspension of crude oil exports, central bank officials said.
    "we hope to obtain a tacit, explicit acceptance from foreign
banks ... that we are not able to service the debt," central
bank president carlos julio emanuel said.
    "the reality is that our debt service capacity has been
totally affected by the recent cataclysm," he added in a news
conference last night.
    A central bank spokesman said emanuel was referring to
payments owed private foreign banks, already suspended since
january. These banks hold two-thirds of the country's 8.16
billion dollar foreign debt.
    Emanuel was not refering to debts to foreign governments
and multilateral organisations, the spokesman said.
    The march 5 earthquake damaged an oil pipeline, preventing
crude exports for a projected five months. Oil generates about
two-thirds of ecuador's total exports and as much as 60 per
cent of the government's revenues.
    Emanuel did not specify how long ecuador would be unable
service private foreign banks. But finance minister domingo
cordovez said two days ago the government is seeking to
postpone all payments due to private foreign banks in 1987
until next year through negotiations with creditors.
    Emanuel said ecuador was seeking soft loans from
multilateral organisations for reconstruction work. It also
wanted a "reprogramming" of already-approved loans, an apparent
reference to the disbursement schedule of thee credits.

<TITLE>MOBIL &lt;MOB> CAPITAL EXPENDITURES LOWER IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Mobil Corp chairman Allen E. Murray
said in the annual report issued today that the company's total
1987 capital expenditures would be lower than the three
billion dlrs spent in 1986.
    "Overall capital and exploration expenditures will fall
slightly below the level for 1986 although we'll be ready to
increase spending whenever the outlook becomes more promising,"
Murray said.
    Mobil data in the annual report shows capital expenditures
have been cut every year since 1984's 3.6 billion dlrs to 3.5
billion dlrs in 1985.
    Murray told shareholders that despite the cuts "the company
has promising acreage to explore as well as major oil and gas
reserves to develop in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Africa and
Indonesia.
    Over the past two weeks Mobil has announced restructuring
of its domestic exploration and development organization and
this week a restructuring of its oil services units, which
support the new affiliate.
    "Mobil's chairman has explained this change by saying we
need a leaner organization to get more efficient usage from our
assets," said John Lord, a Mobil Corp spokesman.
    Murray said in announcing the first reorganization, which
will combine its current three exploration and producing
affiliates into one organization, Mobil Exploration and
Production U.S. Inc, that it is more effective than the present
organization and will improve the company's upstream
competitive position.
    Yesterday the company said that it will restructure its
Mobil Exploration and Producing Services Inc, MEPSI, to enhance
the development and transfer of technology supporting critical
areas of exploration, drilling, resevoir management and
computer systems.
    Earnings from Mobil's upstream operations in 1986 were 827
mln dlrs, down 54 pct from the previous year's 1.8 billion dlrs
in earnings.
    Mobil's strategy in the exploration and production sector
will be to give most attention to exploration possibilities
with the greatest long term potential, the company said.
    In its annual report, Mobil said that this will include
greater emphasis on "frontier plays that, although riskier, fit
our strengths of technology and size...This probably also means
a shift toward emphasis in the foreign area since selective
overseas exploration offers greater potential."

<TITLE>BRAZILIAN TROOPS TO LEAVE OIL REFINERIES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Stephen Powell, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SAO PAULO, MARCH 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil's labour troubles eased a
little today as the authorities announced they were withdrawing
troops from the country's main oil installations occupied three
days ago.
    The troops went in at the request of the state-oil company
Petrobras because of the threat of a strike by 55,000 oil
industry employees.
    Petrobras said in a statement today it had requested the
withdrawal of the troops. The situation in the refineries was
calm, it said, and the employees had indicated their
willingness to negotiate a pay deal.
    A national seamen's strike, however, continued and marines
remained in the country's main ports. The marines were
despatched to the ports after the seamen's strike, now two
weeks old, was ruled illegal last Friday.
    A spokesman at the national strike headquarters in Rio de
Janeiro said today a total of l63 ships were strike-bound, 135
in Brazil and 28 in foreign ports.
    Yesterday two small companies specialised in the transport
of chemicals, Global and Flumar, struck a pay accord with their
seamen who have secured a 120 pct increase.
    Brazilian newspapers today hailed these agreements as a
sign that the national strike could soon come to an end.
    Both companies employ fewer than 200 seamen and union
leaders said the vast majority of Brazil's 40,000 seamen were
still on strike.
    The threat of a stoppage by oil industry employees appeared
today to be receding. Petrobras said in its statement that the
company would meet union leaders for pay talks in Rio de
Janeiro next Wednesday.
    Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto would act as a mediator.
    Besides industrial troubles, there has also been
considerable unrest this week in the agricultural sector.
    On Tuesday hundreds of thousands of farmers held rallies
throughout the country to protest against high interest rates.
    Television reports showed some of these protests still
continuing today, with farmers blockading banks with their
vehicles in several towns in the states of Sao Paulo and
Parana.
    The strikes in Brazil come as the government is trying to
extricate itself from a serious debt crisis brought on by a
deterioration in its trade balance.
    On February 20 President Jose Sarney announced that Brazil
was suspending interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of debt to
private banks.
    Because of the seamen strike exports are being delayed and
the country is losing badly needed foreign exchange.

end stood at 2.5 billion barrels, an increase of 94 mln barrels
or four pct above the previous year and detailed data show that
the gains resulted from an increase in net proved reserves of
natural gas liquids.
    Mobil said gains were in Indonesia where a sixth production
facility began operation in October with a capacity to
manufacture 1.7 mln tonnes of liquified natural gas.
    The company also said that new capacity brought onstream
last year replaced 120 pct of Mobil's production, which
declined by about four pct in 1986 from the previous year.
    Detailed data on reserves shows that U.S. net proved
reserves of crude oil fell to 837 mln barrels from 853 mln
barrels in 1985, natural gas liquid reserves were also lower in
1986 from the previous year.
    Net proved crude oil reserves also fell in Canada to 224
mln barrels and in Europe to 403 mln barrels from the previous
year's level of 231 mln barrels and 439 mln barrels,
respectively.

is likely to attract buying from the Soviet Union and China,
Woodhouse, Drake and Carey said in their latest weekly market

    Present lower terminal values may be a reflection of the

<TITLE>S/P DOWNGRADES FOUR TEXAS BANKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poor's Corp said it
downgraded four Texas banks in a move that affects a combined
800 mln dlrs of debt securities and preferred stock.
    Cut were the debt ratings of Allied Bancshares Inc &lt;ALBN>,
First Amarillo Bancorp Inc &lt;FAMA>, MCorp &lt;M> and Texas American
Bancshares Inc &lt;TXA>.
    S and P cited continuing asset quality problems.
    While problem energy loans appear to be abating, real
estate problems are mounting, S and P said. The rating agency
also said it expects earnings to remain under pressure for the
remainder of this year.
    Standard and Poor's reduced Allied Bancshares' senior debt
to BBB-minus from BBB and commercial paper to A-3 from A-2.
Issues supported by a letter of credit from lead bank Allied
Bank of Texas, and the bank's certificates of deposits, were
reduced to BBB-minus and A-3 from BBB and A-2 respectively.
    Allied has 50 mln dlrs of debt outstanding. S and P said
its profitability remains severely depressed.
    S and P cut First Amarillo's 15 mln dlrs of subordinated
debt to CCC-minus from B-minus. The institution's implied
senior debt rating is CCC-plus. S and P noted that First
Amarillo has had three consecutive years of losses.
    S and P downgraded MCorp's senior debt to BBB-minus from
BBB-plus, subordinated debt to BB-plus from BBB, preferred to
BB-minus from BB and commercial paper to A-3 from A-2.
    That affected 600 mln dlrs of debt. S and P cited rising
non-performing loans and high loan-loss provisions.
    Also, the agency cut to BBB-minus and A-3 from BBB-plus and
A-2, respectively, CDs and issues supported by letters of
credit from the units MBank Dallas and MBank Houston.
    S and P cut to BB from BBB-minus Texas American's 65 mln
dlrs of senior debt. Lead bank Texas American Bank NV's CDs
were lowered to BB-plus/B from BBB-minus/A-3.

<TITLE>TALKING POINT/BANK STOCKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>CitiCorp &lt;CCI> appears to be digging
in its heels for tough negotiations over the billions of
dollars in loans that Brazil owes to money center banks, Wall
Street analysts said.
    "I view it as pre-negotiation posturing," said analyst
Carole Berger of Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc, referring to both
Brazil and Citicorp. Brazil recently stopped paying interest on
its commercial bank debt. Today, CitiCorp said its first
quarter income would be reduced by 50 mln dlrs after tax if it
lists the loans as non-performing status.
    Citicorp filed an 8-K form with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, indicating a material change in its financial
situation. "Citicorp is saying  you can't scare us with
threats, we'll make your loans non-performing right now,"
Berger said.
    The loans have to be treated as non-performing after 90
days without a payment. CitiCorp said only that the situation
will be reviewed at the end of the current quarter.
    Berger asserted that Brazil is doing its own politicking by
talking to U.S. regulators and trying to drive a wedge between
U.S. and European banks.
    Analyst Lawrence Cohn of Merrill Lynch and Co said it is
unlikely the situation will be resolved until the second half
of this year.
    "Ultimately the Brazilians are going to have to pay up on
all the interest they owe," Cohn said. "The real issue is the
rescheduling of debt terms.
    Another question is whether or not the International
Monetary Fund can help Brazil with a new austerity program.
    Stocks of money center banks were mostly down fractions in
late dealings. One trader most stocks in the group bounced off
their lows by midday as investors took the news in stride.
    Cohn said the bank stocks may be risky until numbers on
non-performing loans are reported for each bank. But he said
investors looking ahead six to 12 months might want to buy at
present levels for the "tremendous fundamental values" in the
group.
    Analyst Robert Gordon of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc said
Manufacturers Hanover Corp &lt;MHC) has the greatest exposure to
Brazilian loans of any New York bank, in terms of percentage of
earnings. He said his only two recommendations currently among
New York banks are J.P. Morgan and Co &lt;JPM> and Bankers Trust
Co &lt;BT> which happen to have the least exposure.
    Gordon said his positive opinion on J.P. Morgan and Bankers
Trust was not merely a response to the fact that the two have
lower exposure to Brazilian loans than other banks. 
    In fact he said there's a chance those banks could get more
involved in the future. He noted that Morgan has already set up
a brokerage subsidiary to deal in loans to less developed
countries.
    "I don't see any reason to change full year earnings
estimates, said Frederick Meinke, analyst at E.F. Hutton Co. He
thinks the confrontation with Brazil could end in a replay of a
situation that occurred with Argentina in 1984 and 1985.
    Meinke noted that in the case of Argentina the loans became
non-accruing for a couple of quarters but then when the banks
came to an agreement with Argentina all the back interest was
paid. "What it did was distort the quarterly earnings pattern,"
he said.
    He said in the case of Brazil write-offs of loans is a
worst-case outcome which is highly unlikely. He noted that
Brazil is a country with a diversified economy, going through
some economic upheaval after the transition from a military to
a civilian government.
    "The countries of Latin America have too much debt relative
to their ability to service it," said John Mason of
Interstate Securities. "We've been fiddling around with these
problems for five years and the hour is growing late."
    He said up to now the banks have reduced their spreads, cut
interest rates internally and extended maturities and none of
these measures has been enough. He expects re-classification of
as much as a third of the loans as non-accruing and he sees
partial write downs of some loans.
    Nevertheless Mason thinks the money center bank stocks 
could be poised for a short term rally.
    A spokesman at First Chicago Corp &lt;FNB> said it is
premature to put Brazil's loans on a cash basis. "It is our
expectation that economic development will allow Brazil to meet
its debt," a spokesman said.
    Bankers Trust in New York said it would be premature to
make a decision. Several other banks queried by Reuters said
much the same thing.
    A spokesman at Manufacturers Hanover noted that of 2.3
billion dlrs in loan exposure to Brazil only 1.3 billion is
subject to Brazil's unilateral moratorium on repayment of
interest.

<TITLE>S/P SEES DRAMATIC GROWTH FOR ASSET-BACKED DEBT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poor's Corp said it
expects the asset-backed securities market to grow dramatically
over the next few years, spurred by what it termed the
compelling benefits of secured financing.
    S and P projected the market would grow to 100 billion dlrs
in the next five years. Investment bankers say the market
currently stands at roughly 11.9 billion dlrs.
    Assets used to secure the debt included auto loans, credit
cars, computer leases and corporate loans, S and P noted. The
most active issuers to date had two main motivations, lower
costs of funding and increased financial flexibility.
    Standard and Poor's pointed out that General Motors Corp
&lt;GM>, Chrysler Corp &lt;C> and Nissan Motor Co Ltd &lt;NSAN> realized
funding advantages by issuing car loan backed debt. But more
important, these issuers were able to increase loan volume, and
hence car sales, without substantially increasing financial
leverage, the rating agency said.
    S and P noted that Bank of America, a unit of BankAmerica
Corp &lt;BAC>, and RepublicBank Corp's &lt;RPT> RepublicBank Delaware
unit issued credit card backed debt and also realized lower
funding costs while mitigating increased funding and liquidity
risks resulting from weak financial performance.

<TITLE>ECUADOR BEGINS WORK ON OIL PIPELINE TO COLOMBIA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    QUITO, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Construction workers today began building
a 26 km (16 mile) pipeline to link Ecuador's jungle oilfields
to a pipeline in Colombia through which Ecuadorean crude could
be pumped to the Pacific Coast, Ecuadorean energy minsitry
officials said.
    They said it would take about two months and at least 15
mln dlrs to build the pipeline from Lago Agrio in Ecuador to
Puerto Colon, Colombia for connection to the Colombian
pipeline, which goes to the port of Tumaco on Colombia's
Pacific Ocean coast.
    The Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon pipeline is designed to
transport between 30,000 to 50,000 barrels of day (bpd) of
Ecuadorean crude to the Colombian pipeline, they said.
    The Colombian pipeline to Tumaco has ample room for
Ecuadorean crude, they said. It is currently transporting about
17,000 bpd out of its 100,000 bpd capacity, an Ecuadorean
energy ministry official said.
    The Ecuadorean crude reaching Tumaco will be shipped by
boat to Ecuador for refining into oil products to meet domestic
demand.
    The completion of the pipeline would allow Ecuador to
resume some of production, paralysed since March six by an 
earthquake the night before.
    The tremor ruptured the country's main pipeline from jungle
oilfields to the Ecuadorean port of Balao, on the Pacific
Ocean.
    Ecuador was pumping about 260,000 bpd before the
earthquake. It would take about five months to repair the
pipeline to Balao, government officials said.
    Ecuador estimates that it will cost between 145 to 150 mln
dlrs to repair oil installations damaged by the earthquake,
energy ministry Javier Espinosa said.

<TITLE>NUMEROUS FACTORS SAID POINT TO USSR CORN BUYING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>A greater than anticipated need,
competitive prices and political motivations could be sparking
Soviet interest in U.S. corn, industry and government officials
said.
    As rumors circulated through grain markets today that the
Soviet Union has purchased an additional 1.5 mln tonnes of U.S.
corn, industry and government sources noted a number of factors
that make Soviet buying of U.S. corn likely.
    First, there are supply concerns. Some trade sources said
recent speculation has been that last year's Soviet grain crop
be revised to only 190 mln tonnes, rather than the 210 mln
announced, therby increasing the Soviet need for grain.
    A drop in Argentine corn crop prospects could also affect
Soviet corn buying, an Agriculture Department source said.
    Dry weather in Argentina -- a major corn supplier to the
USSR -- and reported crop problems prompted USDA to lower its
Argentine 1986/87 corn crop estimate this week to 11.0 mln
tonnes, down from 11.5 mln. Argentina corn exports were also
cut by 500,000 tonnes to 6.8 mln tonnes.
    Argentina has already committed four mln tonnes of this
year's corn for export, a USDA official said, with two mln
tonnes of that booked for April-June delivery to the USSR.
    "Significant downside potential" still exists for the
Argentine crop, the official said, which will decrease the
amount of additional corn that country can sell to Moscow.
    "If the Soviet needs are greater than we have been
thinking, then they might need more than what Argentina can
provide during the April to June period," he said.
    Current competitive prices for U.S. corn have also sparked
Soviet buying.
    U.S. corn was reported to be selling on the world market
earlier this week for around 71 dlrs per tonne, Argentine corn
for 67 dlrs -- a very competitive price spread, U.S. and Soviet
sources said.
    "This price difference makes American corn competitive,"
Albert Melnikov, commercial counselor for the Soviet Union,
told Reuters.
    Impending crop problems in Argentina will likely cause
those prices to rise, and with the recently strong U.S. corn
futures prices, the Soviets might feel corn prices have
bottomed and that this is a good time to buy, sources said.
    Finally, some industry sources said that by buying the
minimum amount of corn guaranteed under the U.S./USSR grains
agreement (four mln tonnes), the Soviet Union may be hoping to
convince the USDA to offer Moscow a subsidy on wheat.
    In an inteview with Reuters this week, USDA secretary
Richard Lyng said that no decision had been made on a wheat
subsidy offer, but that such an offer had not been ruled out.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>RJR Nabisco Inc is raising 500 mln
dlrs via an issue of sinking fund debentures due 2017 yielding
8-3/4 pct, said lead manager Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
    The debentures have an 8-5/8 pct coupon and were priced at
98.675 to yield 115 basis points over the off-the-run 9-1/4 pct
Treasury bonds of 2016.
    Non-refundable for 10 years, the issue is rated A-1 by
Moody's and A by Standard and Poor's. A sinking fund beginning
in 1998 to retire annually five pct of the debentures can be
increased by 200 pct at the company's option.
    Dillon, Read and Co Inc co-managed the deal.

may downgrade Home Shopping Network Inc's 250 mln dlrs of Ba-3
senior notes.
    The rating agency cited Home Shopping's plan to issue
additional debt, thereby increasing leverage. Moody's noted
that the company intends to use a portion of the proceeds to
repurchase existing debt.
    Moody's said its review would focus on Home Shopping's
future capital structure and examine the added risk associated
with the company's commitment to diversify its product line to
include financial services.

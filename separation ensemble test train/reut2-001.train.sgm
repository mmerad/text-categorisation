<DATELINE>    ROME, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Italy's state-owned &lt;Banca Nazionale del
Lavoro - BNL> said it would issue 120 mln dlrs of five-year
convertible eurobonds, an operation to be lead-managed by
&lt;Credit Suisse-First Boston Ltd>.
    BNL president Nerio Nesi told a news conference that the
issue, to be placed on the main international markets and
listed in Luxembourg, would be the first equity linked issue by
an Italian bank on the Euromarket.
    BNL officials said the issue is scheduled for mid-March and
additional financial details were not immediately available.
    They said the operation would be through the issue of
depositary receipts by BNL's London branch. They said the bonds
would carry warrants issued by its &lt;Efibanca> subsidiary and
convertible into BNL saving shares within five years.
    The officials said a banking consortium led by Credit
Suisse-First Boston would at the same time arrange for the
private placing of an unspecified number of BNL savings shares
with foreign institutional investors.
    The operation was to further its aim of obtaining a listing
on foreign stock exchanges with a view to future capital
increases through ordinary share issues, they said.

has revised downward its previously reported fourth quarter and
year, ended October 31, results to reflect compensation expense
for employee stock options.
    The company said resolution of this disagreement with its
auditors came as a result of Securities and Exchange Commission
involvement. The company will amend its option-granting
procedure to conform to the SEC decision which will eliminate
future charges, it added.
    Transform said its fourth quarter profit was revised to
305,082 dlrs, or two cts a share, from the previously reported
580,955 dlrs, which left the company with a fiscal 1986 loss of
249,814 dlrs, or two cts a share, instead of the reported
26,195 dlrs profit.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>UNILEVER HAS IMPROVED MARGINS, VOLUMES IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, MARCH 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Unilever Plc &lt;UN.A> and NV group reported
improvements in margins and underlying sales volume growth of
five pct in 1986 after stripping out the effects of falling
prices, disposals and currency movements, Unilever Plc chairman
Michael Angus said.
    He told reporters that volumes in North America increased
some 10.5 pct while European consumer goods rose about 2.5 pct
after being flat for some years.
    Much of the disposal strategy, aimed at concentrating
activities on core businesses, had now been completed, he
noted.
    But the process of acquisitions would go on, with strategic
acquisitions taking place "from time to time," he said.
    The company earlier reported a 20 pct rise in pre-tax
profits for 1986 to 1.14 billion stg from 953 mln previously.
In guilder terms, however, profits at the pre-tax level dropped
three pct to 3.69 billion from 3.81 billion.
    Angus said the recent purchase of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc
&lt;CBM.N> for 72.50 dlrs a share was unlikely to bring any
earnings dilution.
    However, it would not add much to profits, with much of the
company's operating profits paying for the acquisition costs.
    Finance director Niall Fitzgerald added that while gearing
- debt to equity plus debt - rose to about 60 pct at end 1986
from 35 pct last year, this was expected to drop back to about
40 pct by end-1987.
    The same divergence was made in full year dividend, with
Unilever NV's rising 3.4 pct to 15.33 guilders and Unilever
Plc's increasing 29.9 pct to 50.17p, approximately in line with
the change in attributable profit.
    Angus said the prospectus for the sale of parts of
Chesebrough was due to be published shortly. However, he said
that there was no target date for completing the process.
    He also declined to say what sort of sum Unilever hoped to
realise from the operation, beyond noting that Chesebrough had
paid around 1.25 billion dlrs for Stauffer Chemical Co, which
operates outside Unilever's core activities.
    In the U.S., Organic growth from the Lipton Foods business,
considerable expansion in the household products business and
in margarine had been behind the overall sales increase.
    However, he noted that the U.S. Household products business
had turned in a planned loss, with fourth quarter performance
better than expected despite the anticipated heavy launch costs
of its Surf detergents.

    The investment includes the purchase of 360,537 newly

about 33 mln dlrs, it said. The loan is convertible into an
additional 229,463 DIM shares, it noted.
    The proposed agreement is subject to approval by the French

<TITLE>CHINA CALLS FOR BETTER TRADE DEAL WITH U.S.</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>China called on the United States to
remove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable trading
status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology.
    But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing
13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are
inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade
Congress to change laws which limit its exports.
    The official International Business newspaper today
published China's demands in a  editorial to coincide with the
visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.
    "It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its
restrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilities
for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese
exports," the editorial said.
    "The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against
favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China
into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP).
    "Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in
recent years, control of them is still extremely strict and
influences normal trade between the two countries," it added.
    The paper also printed an article by China's commercial
counsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who said
that "all kinds of difficulties and restrictions" were preventing
bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential.
    He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour, curbs on
technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige
said after the release of a sharply lower January leading
indicator index that a pickup in exports is needed.
    "The best tonic for the economy now would be a pickup in net
exports," he said in a statement after the department reported
the index fell 1.0 pct in January from December, the sharpest
drop since a 1.7 pct fall in July, 1984.
    The main reasons for the January decline after a 2.3 pct
December rise were declines in building permits, new orders for
plant and equipment and for consumer and industrial goods.

<TITLE>PRECAMBRIAN SHIELD TAKES 51 MLN DLR WRITEDOWN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CALGARY, Alberta, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Precambrian Shield Resources
Ltd>, earlier reporting a large loss against year-ago profit,
said the 1986 loss was mainly due to a 51,187,000 dlr writedown
on its U.S. operations, uneconomic coal and other mineral
properties.
    Precambrian, which is 89 pct owned by &lt;Mark Resources Inc>,
said it took the writedown in accordance with new Canadian
Insititute of Chartered Accountants guidelines for full cost
method accounting by oil and gas companies.
    Precambrian earlier reported a 1986 loss of 53.4 mln dlrs,
compared to profit of 4.5 mln dlrs in the prior year.

<TITLE>KENYAN ECONOMY FACES PROBLEMS, PRESIDENT SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NAIROBI, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Kenyan economy is heading for
difficult times after a boom last year, and the country must
tighten its belt to prevent the balance of payments swinging
too far into deficit, President Daniel Arap Moi said.
    In a speech at the state opening of parliament, Moi said
high coffee prices and cheap oil in 1986 led to economic growth
of five pct, compared with 4.1 pct in 1985.
    The same factors produced a two billion shilling balance of
payments surplus and inflation fell to 5.6 pct from 10.7 pct in
1985, he added.
    "But both these factors are no longer in our favour ... As a
result, we cannot expect an increase in foreign exchange
reserves during the year," he said.
    The price of coffee, Kenya's main source of foreign
exchange, fell in London today to about 94 cents a pound from a
peak of 2.14 dlrs in January 1986.
    Crude oil, which early last year slipped below 10 dlrs a
barrel, has since crept back to over 18 dlrs.
    Moi said the price changes, coupled with a general decline
in the flow of capital from the rest of the world, made it more
difficult to finance the government's budget deficit.
    Kenya was already spending over 27 pct of its budget on
servicing its debts and last year it was a net exporter of
capital for the first time in its history, he added.
    "This is a clear indication that we are entering a difficult
phase as regards our external debts, and it is imperative that
we raise the rate of domestic savings and rely less on foreign
sources to finance our development," he said.
    "It will be necessary to maintain strict discipline on
expenditure ... And members of this house will have to take the
lead in encouraging wananchi (ordinary people) to be more
frugal in satisfying immediate needs," the president added.

<TITLE>PHARMACIA FORECASTS HIGHER 1987 EARNINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pharmacia AB &lt;PHAB ST> forecast
earnings after financial items of one billion crowns in 1987 vs
821.2 mln last year on condition that exchange rates remained
at their present parities.
    Sales would in such circumstances go up to six billion
crowns from 3.65 billion in 1986, it said.
    A weakening Dollar was mainly responsible for a five pct
negative impact on sales during 1986 which the company blamed
on currency movements.
    Last year's results were also badly hit by a once-off
writedown of 520 mln crowns for intangible assets.
    The company said mainly this represented the premium the
group had paid for the know-how of various high-tech firms it
had taken over.
    The accounts also showed a financial deficit of 1.87
billion crowns vs a deficit of 133 mln which was covered partly
by drawing down company liquidity to 738 mln vs one billion and
partly by increasing borrowing to 2.23 billion vs 621 mln.
    Pharmacia said the financial deficit was caused by it
having used more funds than generated by group operations,
mainly because of the 1.36 billion it paid in cash for shares
in LKB-Produkter AB and the assets of Intermedics-Intraocular
Inc.

year ago.
    January wheat exports comprised 251,000 tonnes to European

<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canada's real gross domestic product,
seasonally adjusted, rose 1.1 pct in the fourth quarter of
1986, the same as the growth as in the previous quarter,
Statistics Canada said.
    That left growth for the full year at 3.1 pct, which is
down from 1985's four pct increase.
    The rise was also slightly below the 3.3 pct growth rate
Finance Minister Michael Wilson predicted for 1986 in
February's budget. He also forecast GDP would rise 2.8 pct in
1987.
    Statistics Canada said final domestic demand rose 0.6 pct
in the final three months of the year after a 1.0 pct gain in
the third quarter.
    Business investment in plant and equipment rose 0.8 pct in
the fourth quarter, partly reversing the cumulative drop of 5.8
pct in the two previous quarters.

<DATELINE>    STATE COLLEGE, Pa., March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Winter wheat crops in the
western Soviet Union, Poland and eastern Czechoslovakia through
northern Romania may suffer some winterkill over the next two
nights, private forecaster Accu-Weather Inc said.
    Western USSR winter wheat areas have had only light and
spotty snow and winterkill is possible tonight and tomorrow
night as temperatures drop to minus 10 to 0 degrees F.
    Snow cover is scant in Poland, with only about 50 pct of
the winter wheat areas reporting one to two inches of snow as
of this morning.
    The remaining 50 pct of winter wheat crops do not have snow
cover, making winterkill possible on each of the next two
nights. Lowest temperatures will be minus 10 to 0 degrees F.
    Winter wheat areas from eastern Czechoslovakia through
northern Romania had light snow flurries yesterday and last
night, but amounts were an inch or less. With temperatures

Lavoro-BNL> said it is negotiating to buy a West German bank as
part of its foreign expansion policy.
    BNL president Nerio Nesi told a news conference the Italian
bank was currently involved in talks but declined to name the
German institution.
    He said the takeover move could be seen as BNL's reply to
Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F>, which entered the Italian market in
December 1986, with the purchase of BankAmerica &lt;BACN>
subsidiary &lt;Banca D'America e D'Italia>.
    Nesi said BNL had also approved a 200 mln dlr credit line
to the Soviet Union aimed at enabling Soviet companies to pay
for Italian imports. He gave no further details.
    BNL officials said the group had also decided to increase
its activities in the Soviet Union by opening a representative
office in Moscow this month through its subsidiary &lt;Sogecred>,
which specialises in Italian-Soviet trade.

enter the U.S. Government securities market to add temporary
reserves, economists said.
    They expect it to supply the reserves indirectly by
arranging 1.5 to two billion dlrs of customer repurchase
agreements. The Fed may add the reserves directly instead via
System repurchases.
    Federal funds, which averaged 6.18 pct yesterday, opened at
6-3/16 pct and stayed there in early trading. Analysts said the
rate is under upward pressure partly from settlement of 8.25
billion dlrs of five-year Treasury notes.

<TITLE>COFFEE TALKS COLLAPSE EASES NEED FOR U.S. BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The collapse of International Coffee
Organization, ICO, talks on export quotas yesterday removes the
immediate need to reinstate U.S. legislation allowing the
customs service to monitor coffee imports, analysts here said.
    The Reagan administration proposed in trade legislation
offered Congress last month that authority to monitor coffee
imports be resumed. That authority lapsed in September 1986. A
bill also was introduced by Rep. Frank Guarini (D-N.J.).
    However, the failure of the ICO talks in London to reach
agreement on export quotas means the U.S. legislation is not
immediately needed, one analyst said. Earlier supporters of the
coffee bill hoped it could be passed by Congress quickly.
    "You're going to have a hard time convincing Congress (now)
this is an urgent issue," the coffee analyst said.

<TITLE>FORMER TREASURY OFFICIAL URGES CURRENCY REFORMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Former Treasury official C. Fred
Bergsten said a new exchange rate system is needed to replace
the fixed and flexible exchange rate systems which he said had
not worked.
    "I prefer a move to 'target zones' in which the major
countries would determine ranges of 15-20 pct within which they
would pledge to hold their exchange rates by direct
intervention and, as necessary, by changes in monetary and
other policies," Bergsten, now the director of the Institute
for International Economics, said in a statement to a House
Banking subcommittee.
    "The substantial correction of the exchange rate that has
occurred since early 1985 is enormously welcome, and should
produce a sizeable reduction in the U.S. trade deficit this
year and next, but the imbalance will not fall much below 100
billion dlrs on present policies, so much more is needed," he
said.

<TITLE>YUGOSLAVIA WHEAT FREE OF WINTERKILL - USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>There was no evidence of winterkill
in Yugoslavian winter wheat during field travel along a line
running northwest from Belgrade to near Maribor, the U.S.
Agriculture Department's counselor in Belgrade said in a field
report.
    The report, dated February 26, said there is evidence of
delayed germination in most areas due to late seeding last fall
because of dry conditions.
    However warm temperatures over the past three weeks have
promoted some early growth and will help the crop catch up on
last fall's late seeding, it said.
    Some Yugoslav agriculture officials are concerned about the
situation because warm temperatures have brought the grain out
of dormancy and taken away snow protection a little early, the
report said.
    Cold temperatures over the next month could cause damage
under these conditions, they said.
    The report said all wheat farmers contacted during the
field trip were optimistic about the crop and the way it
emerged from winter.

to a seasonally adjusted 2.27 billion dlrs in the fourth
quarter from a deficit of 1.94 billion dlrs in the third,
Statistics Canada said.

    The agency said the rise in the merchandise surplus, to
2.77 billion dlrs from 2.20 billion dlrs in the third quarter,
was more than offset by high deficits in servicies and
investment. The total non-merchandise deficit grew to 5.04
billion dlrs from 4.14 billion dlrs.
    The current account deficit was 912 mln dlrs in the fourth
quarter of 1985.
    In the capital account, not seasonally adjusted, there was
a total net inflow of 4.76 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter,
up from a net inflow of 3.22 billion dlrs in the third quarter
quarter.
    The total net capital inflow rose to 13.74 billion dlrs in

major future expansion.

provision of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 may add 1.30 to 1.60 to
1987 earnings per share.
    The insurance holding company had net earnings of 449.6 mln
dlrs, or, or 7.42 per share, in 1986.
    John Loynes, Continental chief financial officer, said the
fresh start provision allowed the company to discount opening
tax reserves to January 1, 1987, which released deferred taxes
into earnings.
    Loynes said the provision's potential benefit would decline
gradually over the next four years, during which time
Continental will pay 250 mln to 350 mln dlrs more in taxes.
    Loynes added, however, the higher taxes are not expecetd to
have a significant impact on earnings.

<TITLE>BELGIAN MINISTER SEES NEW ACCORD ON EC OILS/FATS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Belgian Foreign Trade Minister Herman
De Croo said he believed there would be a compromise within the
European Community, EC, on its proposed tax on vegetable fats
and oil, averting a pledged tough trade response by the United
States.
    De Croo, in Washington for talks with Administration
officials and Congressional leaders, said at a news conference
there is a battle within the community on the tax on fats and
oils used in the 12 EC countries.
    But he added, "I do not think it will be a big issue because
there will be a big debate inside Europe," adding "so there will
be a compromise."
    U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said yesterday
that if the community went ahead with the tax, the United
States would respond "vigorously" to protect its trade rights and
access to community markets.
    De Croo also said he thought the community would postpone
its April 28 deadline for imposing new slaughterhouse rules to
cover all meats brought into EC nations if some progress was
made toward resolving differences with the United States.
    U.S. officials say its rules now meet health standards and
the EC should require equivalent but not identical standards.
    He also told reporters he hoped the community could deal
with another controversial health proposal that would forbid
the feeding of hormones to cattle, which is also opposed by the
United States.
    De Croo gave no deals on how he though the issue might be
resolved. That rule is go into effect on January 1, 1988.
    He said U.S. cattlemen say there is no reason to change
slaughterhouse practices in April if the meat is to be banned a
few months later by the hormone rule.

<TITLE>DUTCH MONEY MARKET DEBT BARELY CHANGED IN WEEK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AMSTERDAM, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Loans and advances from the Dutch
central bank to the commercial banks were barely changed at
12.9 billion guilders in the week up to and including March 2,
the central bank weekly return showed.
    The Treasury's account with the bank dropped 1.3 billion
guilders. Dealers said a larger amount of funds in the form of
interest and repayments on state loans went out than came in
the form of tax payments to the state.
    Notes in circulation rose 360 mln to 27.7 billion as the
public withdrew cash to celebrate this week's Carnival festival
or take an end-of-winter holiday break, dealers said.
    Current money market rates are at 5-3/4 to 6-1/4 pct for
call money against 5-1/4 to 5-3/8 a week ago, and between
5-5/16 and 5-9/16 pct against 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 for one to 12
month periods, dealers said.
    The cause for the rise was a rather tight 4.8 billion
guilders of special advances set by the Bank yesterday compared
with 8.0 billion guilders for the previous set, dealers added.
    They expect the money market shortage to continue around 12
billion guilders this week.
    The weekly return showed total Dutch gold and currency
reserves rose 11.3 mln guilders to 56.0 billion guilders.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The upcoming five-month deficiency
payments to corn and sorghum farmers will be made half in cash
and half in generic commodity certificates, a senior
Agriculture Department official told Reuters.
    Around 300 mln dlrs of the in-kind certificates, or
"certs," will be mailed out to farmers around March 15 or 16,
Tom von Garlem, Assistant Deputy Administrator for USDA's state
and county operations, said.
    The decision to make the payments in a 50/50 cash/certs
ratio was made Monday, but payments to producers will be
delayed until mid-month due to a problem with USDA's computer
program, von Garlem said.
get 11.5 cts per bushel in this next payment -- 5.75 cts in
certs and around 5.5 cts cash (5.75 cts minus Gramm-Rudman).
    Farmers who did not receive advance deficiency payments at
signup will receive 63 cts per bushel. Slightly more than half
of this payment will be in cash, von Garlem said, but he said
this will not markedly upset the 50/50 ratio, since most
farmers got advance payments.
    "The final certificate payments will be very close to 300
mln dlrs," he said.
    When asked if the Office of Management and Budget had
resisted the cash/certs ratio, the USDA official said that "we
proposed 50/50 and OMB accepted it."

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>VENEZUELA PLANS NEW BORROWING WITH LIMITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CARACAS, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Venezuela will limit new loans to 50 pct
of the interest and principal it repays on its 31 billion dlr
foreign debt, President Jaime Lusinchi told political leaders.
    Speaking last night at a new session of congress, he said
last week's agreement to reschedule 21 billion dlrs in public
sector foreign debt at lower interest rates reflected
Venezuela's improved credit image.
    "Our priority is development, but I insist that there cannot
be development if we don't fulfil our obligations," he said.
    Venezuela agreed last Friday with its 13-bank advisory
committee to lower the interest margin to 7/8 pct over libor
from 1-1/8 and reduce amortisations in the next three years to
1.35 billion dlrs from 3.35 billion.
    "The important thing is that this rate of 7/8 pct is a
marker for new negotiations and will save us 50 mln dlrs this
year," Lusinchi said.
    He said the country had been loyal to the principles of the
Cartagena group of Latin American debtors but had "decided to
reach an agreement convinced that Venezuela is a specal case,
because of the vulnerability of its economy."
    Venezuela signed a 12-1/2 year rescheduling accord in
February, 1986, but immediately sought new terms because of
falling oil income, which dropped 40 pct last year.
    Finance Minister Manuel Azpurua told reporters he hopes to
sign the new rescheduling accord early in the second quarter,
but that in any case it would become effective from April 1.
    Azpurua said Venezuela's 450 or so creditor banks have been
contacted with details of the new agreement, and that Public
Finances Director Jorge Marcano may visit financial centres to
round up support.
    Azpurua said that among the details still to be finalised
were the exact timetable for reprogrammed payments and the
outlines of a government plan to allow public and private
sector debt capitalisation.
    He said banks had shown willingness to consider new loans
to Venezuela, a fundamental achievement in the new accord.
    "Substantial progress has been made in talks and we will now
have to define more precisely what projects can be financed
from foreign borrowing," he said, adding that loans for steel
and aluminium and iron ore sectors could be the first to
materialise.

    The U.S., the world's largest copper consumer and second
biggest producer after Chile, has proposed setting up a body to
improve statistics and market transparency of the copper
economy, and provide a forum for discussion.
    The new body would not aim at negotiating measures to

<TITLE>ROYAL BANK/CANADA SEES HIGHER 1987 LOAN LOSSES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Royal Bank of Canada> said it
estimates 1987 loan losses at one billion dlrs, a 25 mln dlr
increase over last year.
    Royal Bank said it set its provisions "given the continued
debt-servicing problems ... in the North American energy
industry and the uncertain outlook for energy prices," and also
continued to add to its general provisions for loans to
troubled borrower countries.
    The bank's loan loss provision for the first quarter ended
January 31 rose to 223 mln dlrs from 187 mln dlrs in the
year-ago quarter.
    The bank said non-accrual loans, net of provisions for loan
losses, totalled 2.2 billion dlrs on January 31, up from 2.0
billion dlrs a year ago.
    In reporting lower first quarter earnings, chairman Allan
Taylor said problems with credit quality--particularly in loans
associated with the energy sector--continue to have a
substantial adverse effect on the bank's earnings.
    Taylor said profitability of the bank's international
operations remains weak, reflecting resource-related
difficulties of private and public sector borrowers and
unsatisfactory results from capital market activities.
    Taylor said it would be premature to speculate on the
outcome of debt resturcturing negotiations with Brazil or their
potential impact on the Royal Bank.
    The bank earlier reported first quarter profit fell to
114.1 mln dlrs from 140.4 mln dlrs a year ago.

<TITLE>PANTERA &lt;PANT> AND PIZZA &lt;PZA> AGREE TO MERGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ST. LOUIS, MO., March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pantera's Corp said it agreed in
principle to acquire Pizza Inn Inc in a cash and stock
transaction.
    Under terms of the proposed transaction, each Pizza Inn
share can be exchanged for either three dlrs in cash plus the
lesser of 1.4 shares of Pantera's common stock or 11.50 dlrs
market value of Pantera's stock, or four dlrs in cash plus a
unit consisting of one share of Pantera's stock and a
non-transferrable right to receive up to 0.55 share of
Pantera's stock under certain conditions, it said.
    Completion of the transaction is subject to arrangement of
financing, negotiation of a definitive agreement, and various
regulatory approvals, it said.
    Pantera's said Pizza Inn's largest shareholder, F.J.
Spillman, previously granted Pantera's an option to buy more
than one mln shares of Pizza Inn common stock owned by him.
    Pantera's also said it retained Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc
to act as its financial advisor in connection with the merger.
Pizza Inn has retained Dean Witter Reynolds Inc to act as its
financial advisor, Pantera's said.
    Yesterday, Pantera's stock closed at 9.50 dlrs on NASDAQ,
while Pizza Inn's stock was quoted at 12 dlrs when the Amex
halted trading pending the announcement of the proposed merger.
    From its Dallas headquarters, Pizza Inn said completion of
the transaction is subject to certain conditions including that
the price of Pantera's stock average not less than seven dlrs
during the 20 trading days before the merger.
    Under the agreement, Pizza Inn said it will still be
permitted to complete a leveraged buyout agreement with Pizza
Inn Acquiring Corp, which has been approved by its
shareholders, but is subject to otaining financing.

<DATELINE>    LAGOS, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Nigeria and Guinea agreed to set up a new
company with Liberia to carry out the 14-year-old
Mifergui-Nimba iron ore project, an official communique said.
    The communique was issued after two days of talks here
between Guinean natural resources minister Ousmane Sylla and
Nigerian minister of mines and power Bunu Sheriff Musa.
    Originally, Guinea held 50 pct in the project and Nigeria
16.2 pct with firms from several other countries also involved,
but the project ran into problems over funding and the slump in
world iron ore markets.
    Musa said Liberia was invited to join and its share will be
decided after a project feasibility study. This would be
completed in May after which finance will be sought. Officials
said the study will be undertaken with the help of the World
Bank, which is also expected to give financial support.
    Production, originally estimated at 15 mln tonnes a year,
will be 12 mln initially and is expected to begin in early
1990.
    On an agreement between the two countries to prospect for
uranium in Guinea, the communique said Musa and Sylla agreed
that because of poor market conditions, it would be extended to
cover exploration for gold, diamonds, cobalt, nickel and
silver.

<TITLE>WORLD BANK TEAM ARRIVES IN UGANDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KAMPALA, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>A World Bank team led by senior
economist Katrine Saito arrived in Uganda for talks on an
economic recovery program projected to cost one billion dlrs
over three years.
    The four-member mission is expected to stay two to three
weeks. An International Monetary Fund (IMF) team is due here
over the same period, a World Bank offical said.
    The World Bank last year criticised Uganda's policies on
deficit financing and exchange and interest rates, issues
likely to dominate talks on the government's proposed recovery
program.
    Finance Minister Chrispus Kiyonga said last month that most
of the one billion dlrs would go towards rehabilitating
industries, repairing and maintaining roads and buying tractors
and other agricultural needs.
    He did not say where the money would come from, but
diplomats expect the government to ask the World Bank and other
foreign donors to provide most of the foreign exchange portion.

lowered the ratings on Loral Corp's subordinated debt to BBB
from A-minus.
    The issue is removed from creditwatch where it was placed
with negative implications in January after Loral said it
planned to acquire Goodyear Aerospace Corp for 640 mln dlrs.
    S/P said the acquisition enhances Loral's competitive
position in the defense electronics industry by broadening its
technology and program base. But most measures of financial
risk deteriorate, it said.

<TITLE>ROYAL BANK SEES IMPROVED RESULTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Royal Bank of Canada>, in reporting a
19 pct drop in first quarter earnings, said it expects to
report improved results in future earnings periods.
    "Healthy consumer credit growth, record fee-based income,
highly profitable securities and foreign exchange trading, and
a solid capital position...combined with the restraint of
non-interest expenses, should lead to improved results in the
periods ahead," chairman Allan Taylor said in a statement.
    The bank earlier reported profit for the first quarter
ended January 31 fell to 114 mln dlrs from 140 mln dlrs a year
ago.
    Taylor said loans to the energy sector continue to
substantially hurt earnings while profitability of the bank's
international operations remains weak, reflecting
resource-related difficulties of private and public sector
borrowers and unsatisfactory results from capital market
activities.
    The bank said earnings from domestic operations rose to 103
mln dlrs in the first quarter from 98 mln dlrs a year ago while
earnings from international operations plunged to 11 mln dlrs
from 42 mln dlrs last year.
    Royal Bank said first quarter international net interest
income declined from last year, reflecting reduced revenues
from international investment banking as well as a significant
loss on disposal of its affiliate in Trinidad and Tobago.
    Other income rose to 251 mln dlrs from 220 mln dlrs last
year. The rise was due to higher commercial banking and retail
deposit service fees, and higher foreign exchange revenue but
lower securities commissions from international investment bank
operations partly offset the gains, Royal Bank said.
    The bank said a two billion dlr increase in total assets to
98.7 billion dlrs was due mainly to continued growth in
consumer lending, particularly residential mortgages.

<TITLE>BELGIAN SAYS EC WOULD REACT TO TEXTILE BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Belgian Foreign Trade Minister Herman
De Croo said if Congress passed legislation curbing world
textile imports the only way the European Community (EC) could
react was to retaliate.
    De Croo said at a news conference "if you limit textile
imports, you will re-orient textiles to Europe."
    And that he said would trigger EC taxes on U.S. goods.
    Congress passed a textile bill two years ago, but it was
vetoed by President Reagan on grounds that curbing imports to
protect the domestic textile industry would trigger retaliation
U.S. trading partners.
    A similar bill has been introducted this year, in a
Congress with a bigger Democratic majority and with a President
weakened by the Iran scandal.
    De Croo, here for talks with Administration officials and
Congressmen, said if a textile bill passed, "the only way we
could react would be retaliation, and it would cause more
retaliation, which is not a good way to deal with problems."
    He said if a textile bill was enacted, "we will impose taxes
on a lot of American products."  He said "it would be stupid. We
have to avoid that."
    He said Congressmen seem upset mosty with Japan, because of
its massive trade suprlus with the United States, and not with
EC nations, but EC nations will be hurt by the diverted 
shipments of Asian textiles.
    De Croo also criticized the way U.S. officials try to solve
EC trade issues, saying "each time we come in contact, it a
conflict contact. The clouts are coming fom the West."
    He said it then is a crisis atmosphere with officials cross
the Atlantic and dramatized with headlines.
    "This is not the way to work in a serious way between two
big powers," De Croo said.

<TITLE>ROSTENKOWSKI OPPOSES PROTECTIONIST TRADE BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said Congress must avoid a temptation
to pass a protectionist trade bill this year.
    In remarks prepared for delivery before the National Press
Club, Rostenkowski, D-Ill., predicted major trade legislation
will be sent to President Reagan by the end of this year.
    But he warned that his "conciliatory message" on the trade
bill did not mean he would oppose a proposal that would warn
other countries their access to the American market would be
curtailed unless they opened their markets to U.S. goods.
    "Complaints about (foreign trade) restraints are not a
smoke screen for protectionism, they a plea for fairness,"
Rostenkowski said.
    "It is only reasonable to ask the nations that have denied
us access to open up in return for continued freedom in the
American market," he added.
    However, he said there would likely be changes in the
market access proposal from the plan which cleared the House
last year. That plan would have set a specific time table for
foreign countries to ease import restraints or they would face
a 25 pct cut in exports to the United States.

<TITLE>WALL STREET STOCKS/ANACOMP INC &lt;AAC></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Anacomp Inc, one of the most actively
traded NYSE issues, rose today as at least one analyst expected
earnings to be boosted by its planned acquisition of a
micrographics company.
    Anacomp rose 1/2 to 6-3/4 on volume of 950,000 shares after
trading as high as seven earlier.
    Howard Harlow, analyst at Whale Securities Corp, said
Anacomp's earnings for fiscal 1987 ending September 31 could be
doubled to 80 cts a share from the 40 cts a share he had
forecast before Anacomp agreed to buy DatagraphiX, a
micrographics firm, from General Dynamics Corp &lt;GD>.
    "The company can earn 80 cts a share in fiscal 1987, maybe
as much as a dlr a share, because of DatagraphiX," Harlow said.
"Most of the benefit will be in the fourth qtr because it will
integrate the company in the second half."
    Anacomp's earnings will be less if it has problems
integrating DatagraphiX, Harlow said.
    A spokesman at Anacomp said the company expects to complete
its deal for DatagraphiX later this month. She would not say
how much it will pay for DatagraphiX, but noted that
DatagraphiX contributed 10 mln dlrs in earnings to General
Dynamics on revenues of 239 mln dlrs in 1986.
    Harlow said a fellow analyst at Whale Securities estimates
that Anacomp will pay between 100 mln dlrs to 150 mln dlrs for
DatagraphiX. "The estimates on the street narrow it down to
between 110 mln dlrs and 130 mln dlrs," Harlow added.
    Anacomp reported net of 2.8 mln dlrs or nine cts a share in
its first qtr ended December 31, up from 301,000 dlrs or one ct
a share.
    In Anacomp's fiscal 1986 it earned 4,073,000 dlrs or 13 cts
a share.
    Whale Securities recommends buying the stock, Harlow said.

<TITLE>U.K. EXPORTS BODY GETS NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    London, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Export Credits Guarantee Department has
named Malcolm Stephens, director of export finance at Barclay's
Bank Plc and a former career civil servant at ECGD for 17
years, to the post of executive director, a department
spokesman said.
    Stephens replaces Jack Gill, who is retiring early aged 57.
    A drop in the ECGD's business volume and a rise in its debt
to the Exchequer have led to criticism in Parliament in recent
years.
    Stephens said the fall in business volume was a top
convern, adding that the department may have to compete more
aggressively with private insurance firms providing similar
services.
    The department's annual report for the year ended March 31,
1986, showed exports insured by the department fell to 15.7
billion stg from 17.4 billion the year before, while its debt
to the Exchequer almost doubled to 756 mln stg.
    Stephens said he had no specific list of changes. But among
his chief concerns was the weakened condition of lesser
developed countries and their ability to pay for their imports.
    The agency will have to review its policies on insuring
export credits to lesser credits on a country by country basis,
he said. "Large lump political risk insurance is the sort of
thing we want to take a look at."
    "You have to try to look forward to see if you are simply in
a peak and trough situation or it is a more long term thing,"
Stephens said, in response to a qustion about whether ECGD will
strike more countries from its list of political risk insurance
recipients.
    He noted that certain countries have already been removed
from the list.

<DATELINE>    HAMBURG, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Visible stocks of 17 oils and fats are
probably peaking now and are likely to fall sharply by October
1 this year, the Oil World newsletter said.
    Oil World forecast that stocks of oils and fats may be cut
to only 9.8 mln tonnes at the end of this season, compared with
10.6 mln a year earlier.
    Its survey covered  13 oils -- soy, cotton, groundnut, sun,
rape, sesame, corn, olive, coconut, palmkernel, palm, lin and
castor  -- and four animal oils and fats -- butter, fish oil,
lard and tallow/greases.
    Oil World's analysis predicted only a slight production
increase of 0.5 mln tonnes in the year to end-September 1987,
compared with increases of 3.6 mln and 4.0 mln tonnes in the
previous two seasons.
    It said world consumption was continuing to rise. Unusually
low prices prevailing since early 1986 had stimulated demand
for both food and non-food purposes, it said.
    World consumption  could increase by a record 2.8 mln
tonnes to 71.8 mln tonnes this season and would be even higher
if the Indian government did not artificially curb domestic
demand.
    Oil World said it did not expect the European Community
(EC) to introduce a vegetable oils tax, but if such a tax were
introduced it would have a negative impact on EC consumption.

<TITLE>COLOMBIA TRADERS SAY NEW COFFEE STRATEGY VITAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOGOTA, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Coffee producing countries must quickly
map out a fresh common strategy following the failure of the
International Coffee Organization, ICO, to reach agreement on
export quotas, Gilberto Arango, president of Colombia's private
coffee exporters' association, said.
    Arango told Reuters that the most intelligent thing now
would be to seek a unifying stand from producers, including
Brazil, in order to map out a strategy to defend prices.
    An ICO special meeting ended last night in London with
exporting and consuming nations failing to agree on a
resumption of export quotas, suspended one year ago after
prices soared following a prolonged drought in Brazil.
    Arango said there would be no imminent catastrophe but
predicted that over the short term prices would undoubtedly
plummet.
    However, he said the market should also take into account
evident factors such as Brazil's low stocks and the sale of the
near totality of the Central American crop.
    Trade sources said Colombia's coffee was today quoted at
1.14 dlrs a lb in New York, its second lowest price in the past
10 years.
    Cardenas said these countries apparently fail to understand
the true impact of such a failure for coffee producing nations
as well as for industrialized countries.
    It is difficult to believe that while efforts are made to
solve the problem of the developing world's external debt,
decisions are being taken which cut earnings used for repaying
those debts, he said.
    "In Colombia's case, we watch with consternation that,
while we try to effectively combat drug trafficking, countries
which support us in this fight seek to cut our jugular vein,"
Cardenas said.

<TITLE>TENDER LOVING &lt;TLCI>, STAFF &lt;STAF> EXTEND PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y. March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Tender Loving Care Health Care
Services Inc said it and Staff Buildiers Inc have extended the
term of their merger agreement until May 31.
    Tender Loving Care also said &lt;Norrell Corp> agreed not to
acquire any additional Staff Builders shares until September
30, adding Norrell was paid 750,000 dlrs for the standstill
arrangement. 
    Tender Loving Care said it agreed to buy the 610,000 Staff
Builders common held by Norrell, about 19.1 pct of those
outstanding, for 6,950,000 dlrs immediately prior to the
consummation of the merger.
    Tender Loving Care said the extended merger agreement
continues to provide for the exchange of 1.6 of its shares for
each Staff Builders share outstanding.
    As announced February 26, the Staff Builders shareholders
meeting to vote on the merger, originally convened and
adjourned December 23, will be reconvened on April 22.
    Tender Loving Care said its payment to Norrell will include
1,950,000 dlrs in cash and five mln dlrs of a new series of
eight pct Tender Loving Care convertible preferred.
    Tender Loving Care said it and Staff Builders have filed a
revised registration and proxy statement with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. Upon clearance of the revised proxy
statement by the commission and its distribution to Staff
Builders' shareholders, that company's management will continue
to solicit proxies for approval of the merger.
    Tender Loving Care said it will have the power to vote
about 15.8 pct of Staff Builders' shares at the adjourned
meeting with a spokesman explaining that this represents the
proxies held by Norrell, which started buying the stock after
the record date for the meeting.
    In addition, Staff Builders officers and directors own
about 13.8 pct of its stock and have agreed to vote in favor of
the merger.
    Accordingly, the vote of an additional 37.1 pct of the
outstanding shares will be required to approve the merger,
Tender Loving Care said.

<TITLE>SOVIET SOYMEAL IMPORTS SEEN RISING IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HAMBURG, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Soviet imports of soymeal may reach or
exceed one mln tonnes between January and September this year,
the Oil World newsletter said.
    Oil World said it was likely the Soviet Union would reduce
soybean imports and step up significantly its imports of meal.
    At least 500,000 tonnes of soymeal may be shipped from the
European Community and South America in the January/March
quarter, with additional large quantities likely to be imported
in the April and July quarters from Argentina and Brazil, it
said. No figures were given for imports in the corresponding
periods of 1986.
    The change made sense in view of the recent purchases of
probably 250,000 tonnes of West European and Polish rapeseed
and large scale butter imports that were expected from March
onward, it said.
    Oil World said substantial losses of Soviet winter grain
area due to recent severe frosts were probably behind the
recent pick-up in Soviet purchases of U.S. Corn.
    It noted that an additional one mln tonnes of U.S. Corn had
been bought recently by the Soviet Union.

<TITLE>ROSTENKOWSKI RELUCTANT TO BACK TAX HIKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said he would be reluctant to back
the tax increase if it did not have President Reagan's support.
    He told a National Press Club luncheon there would be a
number of tax proposals that could be debated if Reagan sought
a tax increase to help balance the budget.
    However, he said he would prefer to leave the tax rates
enacted in last year's tax reform bill unchanged.
    There have been calls in Congress to hold the rates at the
1987 level rather than allow them to fall next year.
    Reagan proposed 22 billion dlrs in revenue as part of his
1988 budget proposal, but it did not include general tax
increases.
    On trade issues, Rostenkowski said he did not expect the
major trade bill this year would single out any U.S. industry
for special protection.
    "To go after individual items in a trade bill is suicide,"
he said.
    This apparently ruled out congressional approval of another
textile trade bill to limit quotas on textile imports, as was
proposed again this year.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The International Monetary Fund  said
it approved 125.9 mln SDR's to assist development in Jamaica.
    Of this total, 85 mln SDR's can be drawn over the next 15
months under a standby arrangement in support of the
government's economic and financial program.
    Another 40.9 mln is available immediately under the
compensatory financing facility, the IMF's pool of funds to
assist countries hit by export shortfalls. The IMF said that
Jamaica had a shortfall in the year ended September 1986 due to
reduced sales of Bauxite, alummina and travel expenditures.
    After some deterioration, the situation and prospects for
Jamaica improved substantially in 1986 and early 1987, mainly
as a result of a decline in energy prices and interest rates,
and a strong recovery in the tourist sector, the IMF said.
    The program that the new funding supports is designed to
continue the adjustment and restructuring effort so as to
achieve sustained growth, a lower rate of inflation and a
balance of payments viability in the medium term.

<TITLE>PERU COFFEE CROP UNAFFECTED BY RAINS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LIMA, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Recent heavy rains have not affected the
Peru coffee crop and producers are looking forward to a record
harvest, the president of one of Peru's four coffee cooperative
groups said.
    Justo Marin Ludena, president of the Cafe Peru group of
cooperatives which accounts for about 20 pct of Peru's exports,
told Reuters a harvest of up to 1,800,000 quintales (46 kilos)
was expected this year. He said Peru exported 1,616,101
quintales in the year to September 1986.
    A spokesman for the Villa Rica cooperative said flood
waters last month had not reached coffee plantations, and the
crop was unaffected.
    Floods in early February caused extensive damage in Villa
Rica, whose coffee cooperative exported 59,960 quintales last
year, according to the state-controlled coffee organisation.
    Marin said the rains would only affect the coffee crop if
they continued through to next month, when harvesting starts.
    He said Peruvian producers were hoping for an increase this
year in the 1.3 pct export quota, about 913,000 quintales,
assigned to them by the International Coffee Organisation, ICO.
    He said Peru exported 1,381,009 quintales to ICO members
last year with a value of around 230 mln dlrs, and another
235,092 quintales, valued at around 35 mln dlrs, to non-ICO
members.

<TITLE>GE &lt;GE> PROFIT OUTLOOK AIDED BY ENGINE ORDER</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>One of General Electric Co's biggest
businesses, aircraft engines, will ride a wave of increasing
profits into 1991 because of a new contract worth 650 mln dlrs,
Wall Street analysts said.
    Previously, it was expected the business would peak and
decline at some point in the next five years. The improved
outlook results from AMR Corp's &lt;AMR> decision to order 40 new
planes powered by CF6-80C2 GE engines.
    "Creative financial footwork helped GE get the order," said
Nicholas Heymann, analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
    AMR declined to go into detail on financing arrangements
for its order of 15 Boeing Co &lt;BA> and 25 &lt;Airbus Industrie>
twinjet long distance aircraft.
    But AMR said it was using "rent-a-plane leases" that allow
it to operate the aircraft without adding to its debt
structure. AMR also has the right to decline delivery of the
planes or return them on short notice. The arrangement protects
AMR in the case of an unexpected development such as a severe
downturn in the economy.
    From GE's point of view the package looks like a good deal
for several reasons, Heymann said.
    GE will be able to record revenue as a sale at the time of
delivery, Heymann noted.
    And if for some reason AMR decides not to take the planes
GE's financial arm, General Electric Financial Services Inc,
would have little trouble rounding up another airline that
wanted the fuel efficient planes. On the whole, the deal
appears to pose little risk for GE, Heymann said.
    GE's stock declined 1/4 to 103-1/2 on 625,000 shares by
midafternoon. H.P. Smith, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham
and Co said for a 40 billion dlr (revenue) company "no one
order will have much of an effect on the stock."
    Russell Leavitt, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc, said the
order "will help to maintain a good level of production and
profitability in the aircraft engine business" for GE.
    Heymann sees operating profits from GE's jet engine
business rising from 870 mln dlrs last year to 1.3 billion dlrs
by 1991.
    Revenue from jet engines was close to six billion dlrs last
year, with well over half of the business in the military
sector, according to analysts' estimates.
    The rosy outlook for GE's jet engine business coincides
with an upbeat performance in other segments.
    Heymann expects GE to earn 1.39 dlrs per share in the first
quarter of 1987. Saying many will be suprised by the results,
he believes GE has shown through its acquisition of RCA Corp
that it has a "unique ability" to buy a major business and
reshape it, pruning some parts and recombining parts with other
elements of its 14 business areas.
    Smith sees GE earning 1.35 dlrs per share in the current
quarter. He credits good results at RCA, in turn aided by the
NBC broadcasting operation, and lower interest rates.
    Leavitt sees 1.40 dlrs for the current quarter, in part
crediting "significant benefits from the RCA acquisition."

600,000 tonnes of French soft wheat has been sold to China for
delivery in the 1986/87 (July/June) year.
    Around 300,000 tonnes were exported to China between July
1986 and February this year.
    Another 100,000 to 150,000 tonnes will be shipped during
this month and around the same amount in April, they said.
    France sold around 250,000 tonnes of soft wheat to China in
1985/86, according to customs figures.
    However, certain exporters fear China may renounce part of
its contract with France after being offered one mln tonnes of
U.S. soft wheat under the Export Enhancement Program in January
and making some purchases under the initiative.

<TITLE>TREASURY'S MULFORD SEES BRAZIL LENDING PROGRESS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Assistant Treasury Secretary David
Mulford said rapid progress was being made in talks with
commercial banks for loans to Argentina, the Philippines and
Brazil.
    "This should result in substantial new lending for the
major debtors in 1987," he said in prepared testimony for the
Subcommittee on International Development Institutions of the
U.S. House of Representatives.
    Until recently, commercial banks were slow to conclude new
financing packages pending completion of a Mexican package,
Mulford said.
    "We are concerned about the backlog of other financial
packages and would like to see these move ahead soon," he said,
"There is some evidence that this is already happening.
    Chile signed an agreement with banks last week, and there
was also an agreement with Venezuela on rescheduling principal
payments on previously renegotiated debt.
    "We look for rapid progress in commercial bank discussions
with Argentina, the Philippines, and ultimately Brazil," he
said.

Carrozzeria Bertone S.P.A. to exhibit Alcan's technology in
aluminum structured vehicles at Geneva's international auto
salon.
    Alcan said it and Bertone have built several Bertone X1/9
sports cars with structures of adhesively bonded sheet
aluminum. It said the bodies were made on presses used for
Bertone's steel-structured sports cars.
    Alcan said two of the cars are currently being tested in
Britain by the Motor Industry Research Association.
     Alcan said it has developed and tested the aluminum
structure technology so that it is suitable for modern auto
making methods and plants.
    Alcan said the technology, which reduces the weight of a
car's basic structure by up to 50 pct, can improve handling and
performance and reduce fuel consumption for any size car. It
said the structures also provide long life without the need for
rust protection.
    The structure provides the same stiffness and safety as
present materials, while continuously bonded seams allow a 65
pct reduction in spot welds, Alcan said.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Moody's Investors Service Inc said it
downgraded to Baa-2 from A-3 the rating on Loral Corp's 7-1/4
pct convertible subordinated debentures of 2010 and on 10-3/4
pct subordinated sinking fund debentures due 1997.
    Moody's said it took the action, which affects
approximately 117 mln dlrs of debt, after examining Loral's
acquisition of Goodyear Aerospace Corp.
    It said the downgrade reflects the substantial increase in
the company's debt in order to finance the acquisition and the
risks of assimilating such a relatively large acquisition.

<TITLE>F.W. WOOLWORTH'S &lt;Z> 1986 PROFITS RISE 21 PCT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Gail Appleson, Reuter</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The specialty retailing area continues
to pay off for F.W. Woolworth Co, once known only as a five and
dime store chain, which said its 1986 income rose 21 pct.
    It was the fourth consecutive year of profit increases for
the New York-based retailer which was founded over 100 years
ago.
    Woolworth's 1986 income rose to 214 mln dlrs or 3.25 dlrs
per share compared with 1985's profit of 177 mln or 2.75 dlrs
per share. Revenues for the year rose to 6.50 billion compared
with the prior year's 5.96 billion.
    For the fourth quarter, the company reported profits rose
10 pct to 117 mln dlrs or 1.78 dlrs per share compared with
1985 fourth quarter results of 106 mln or 1.64 dlrs per share.
Revenues rose to 2.02 billion from 1.85 billion dlrs.
    Roy Garofalo, Woolworth vice president, told Reuters that
income generated by the company's specialty store operations
accounted for 52 pct of the parent company's 1986 profits.
    He said the company now has 4,700 specialty stores
operating under 30 different names. Woolworth plans to open 650
more specialty stores in 1987. At this time last year, it
operated 4,100 specialty stores, Garofalo said.
    Garofalo said the largest specialty chain operated by
Woolworth is Kinney Shoe Stores, followed by the Richman
apparel unit. Among other units are Little Folk Shop, a chain
of discount children's apparel stores; The Rx Place, a discount
drug, health and beauty aid operation; and Face Fantasies,
which sells cosmetics. There are currently about 1,700
Woolworth general merchandise stores operating worldwide, of
which 1,200 are in the United States.
    Harold Sells, chairman and chief executive of Woolworth,
said in a statement, "These results are especially gratifying as
they are an improvement over last year's record earnings."
    Sells that it was the fourth successive year earnings in
each quarter improved over the corresponding year-earlier
period.
    Woolworth's variety store operations were hard hit in the
1970's and early 1980's by the quickly growing discount store
industry. In an attempt to compete in the 1970's, Woolworth
opened a discount general store chain, Woolco, and J. Brannam,
a discount apparel chain. Both were failures in the United
States, although Woolco still operates in Canada.
    In 1985, however, Woolworth changed its strategy and
announced that it would operate specialty stores. At that time,
the company said it would create 14 new groups of such stores.
Specialty stores generally have higher sales per square foot
than general merchandise stores.

<TITLE>TREASURY'S MULFORD BACKS DEBT CONVERSIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Assistant Treasury Secretary David
Mulford said he prefers debt conversion plans to help heavily
indebted countries over quick-fix political plans to help ease
their debt burden.
    "In my view, debt conversions or swaps into either equity
or local debt claims provide a preferable route to 'debt
relief' for the debtor nations, particularly if combined with
measures to encourage new equity investment and the
repatriation of flight capital," he told the House Subcommittee
on International Development Institutions.
    Mulford criticized what he called large-scale solutions to
the debt problems effecting many developing countries, ranging
from debt forgiveness to creating new multilateral institutions
for lending.
    "While such approaches may have some political appeal, they
are impractical and ultimately counterproductive," he said.
    He said debt conversions, or swaps, are more effective
because they eliminate the interest service on converted debt,
create new jobs and open up investment opportunities that can
help indebted countries overcome their own problems.

<TITLE>CANADA ECONOMY EXPECTED TO GROW MODERATELY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Russell Blinch, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canadian economic growth is expected to
slow further in 1987, but an improved the trade picture should
keep the country from recession, economists said.
    "The economy is ready for about a 2.0 pct rate of growth
over the course of 1987," said Carl Beigie, Chief Economist at
Dominion Securities Pitfield Ltd.
    Statistics Canada reported that gross domestic product,
grew 3.1 pct in 1986, the fourth year of continuous expansion,
but down from 1985's four pct.
    In the final quarter, GDP, in 1981 prices and at annualized
rates, rose a slight 0.2 pct after expanding 0.8 pct in the
third quarter.
    "Essentially it is a flat performance," said Warren Jestin,
deputy chief economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia.
    Economist Wendy Smith Cork of the brokerage Nesbitt Thomson
Bongard Inc said "it shows the economy is not moving along very
steadily, it's not a very promising number."
    "We weren't surprised, we expected to see one bad quarter
in Canada, but we don't think there will be a recession," she
added.
    The rise in GDP was below the 3.3 pct increase forecast by
Federal Finance Minister Michael Wilson in his budget last
month. He also projected the economy would expand  2.8 pct this
year.
    Many economists are less optimistic, predicting growth will
likely be in the 2.0 to 2.2 pct range.
    Statistics Canada also reported the country's trade
performance deteriorated sharply last year as the deficit in
the current account rose to a record 8.8 billion Canadian dlrs
from the previous year's shortfall of 584 mln dlrs.
    "The sharp increase in the deficit originated from
merchandise trade transactions where imports continued to
advance strongly whereas exports were virtually unchanged," the
federal agency said in a statement.
    The merchandise trade surplus was pared to 10.13 billion
dlrs in 1986 from 17.48 billion dlrs in 1985.
    But economist Cork said the expected upturn in the U.S.
economy will lead to increased demand for Canadian goods, and
help fuel the country's modest expansion. Nearly 80 pct of
Canada's exports are shipped to the U.S. each year.

<TITLE>BANK OF ENGLAND PROPOSES LIMITS ON UNDERWRITERS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Norma Cohen and Geert Linnebank, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England proposed that banks
in Britain for the first time will have to seek authorization
to be lead underwriters of new issues in the euromarkets.
    In addition, the Bank has proposed limits on the amount of
credit risk that firms can take on with each new issue they
lead manage.
    The proposed rules were outlined today in a consultative
paper on large credit exposures taken by recognized banks and
deposit takers and may be modified, the Bank said.
    The rules could affect billions of dollars of eurobond
securities issued each year. In 1986, about 183 billion dlrs of
new eurobonds were offered, according to figures compiled by
Euromoney magazine.
    Up until now, there have been no restrictions on lead
managing eurobond issues.
    However, eurobond market participants believe the Bank of
England is concerned about intense competition for market share
which may have caused some firms to expose themselves to
imprudent credit risk.
    Competition for market share has been a boon to issuers as
banks compete to offer the best terms. But the new rules
suggest that some constraints may be placed on competition as
regulators attempt to ensure that no bank takes on more risk
than it can handle. Banking sources said that while the Bank of
England is reluctant to inhibit competition, it is willing to
accept some constraints in order to ensure that underwriters
act prudently.
    "The Bank's assessment of the appropriateness of a bank's
lead underwriting activity will depend primarily upon the skill
and experience of the lead underwriter in the particular market
concerned...," the Bank's proposal said.
    Once a firm has received permission to act as lead
underwriter, the exposure will be valued at one-sixth of the
face amount of the securities. Nominal exposure exceeding 60
pct of capital must be reported to the Bank of England and it
must be notified in advance for exposure of over 150 pct of
capital.
    The exposure will be determined to exist for a maximum of
28 days following a binding commitment to underwrite. After
that, any remaining exposure from unsold securities will be
assessed at their full face value.
    The rules would not apply to syndicated loan facilities,
revolving credits or commercial paper, the Bank said.
    The Bank also amended other aspects of plans to strengthen
its supervisory powers over banks in the paper, which called
for comments from professionals by March 31 to allow their
possible inclusion in the Banking Bill in time for its planned
final discussion in Parliament, scheduled before summer.
    The new Banking Bill, updating the 1979 Banking Act, is the
third leg of the Conservative government's legislation for the
supervision of financial institutions.
    It is to feature alongside the Financial Services Act,
aimed to bolster investor protection, and the Building
Societies Act, which put these institutions on an equal footing
with banks.
    The proposed legislation would abolish distinctions between
recognised banks and licensed deposit-takers and tighten legal
controls, making it a criminal offence to mislead supervisors.
    Proposals to require banks to inform the Bank of England in
advance of planned exposures in excess of 25 pct of their
capital, and to have the Bank supervise exposures between 10
and 25 pct of capital, were not under debate, the paper showed.
    However, preliminary consultations with bank
representatives had shown some of the initial proposals to be
flawed, it said.
    Most proposed changes involved evaluating exposures on a
case-by-case basis rather than along general lines.
    Amendments involved the Bank's proposed treatment of
exposures by financial institutions acting as banker to other
units of their own group of companies, the paper showed.
    They also regarded the treatment of credit exposure to
local governments and other public sector entities, and of
exposures undertaken by banks that are subsidiaries of banks.
    Proposals on how to value securities given by a debtor as
collateral to a credit were slightly changed, the paper showed.
    Exposures taken on by banks acting as creditor within their
own group of companies would usually be looked into on a
case-by-case basis under new proposals, it said.
    The paper said exposures to state-owned industries and
other public sector authorities in the U.K. and abroad should
be given the more lenient treatment of credits to governments
provided a government gives unconditional repayment guarantees.
    It cautioned that exposures to U.K. local authorities and
those guaranteed by the British Export Credit Guarantee
Department would probably not qualify for such treatment.
    On credits granted by banks which are a subsidiary of
another bank, an earlier-proposed 100 pct of capital ceiling
could be exceeded in individual cases.
    But the parent bank would have to give a formal undertaking
to take over the exposure if problems were to occur, and state
in writing that the exposure was retained in the subsidiary's
balance sheet to meet precise group objectives, the paper said.
    On collateral security, it said this "should normally only
be taken into account when considering the acceptability of a
bank's exposure up to 25 pct of its capital base."
    "The presence of security taken on its own will be
considered by the Bank as an acceptable reason for an exposure
in excess of 25 pct, but only in the most exceptional
circumstances and even then to a very limited extent," it said.

<TITLE>GOODYEAR &lt;GT> CHAIRMAN CRITICIZES CORPORATE RAIDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MIAMI, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The chairman of Goodyear Tire and Rubber
Co, a concern that survived a recent hostile takeover bid,
charged that "terrorists in three-piece suits" are undermining
the nation's industrial base.
In a speech to a meeting of south Florida business executives,
Goodyear Chairman Robert Mercer lashed out at corporate raiders
and takeover specialists, accusing them of causing serious harm
to the companies they target.
  "Their interest is not in preserving and strengthening
America's industrial and providing jobs," he said. "Their
product is simply deals, and that is not a product which a
country ... can base a future on."
    Last year, Mercer fought off a takeover attempt by British
industrialist Sir James Goldsmith.
    But Goodyear's independence was preserved at a high price,
Mercer said.
    The company bought back Goldsmith's stock for 620 mln dlrs,
giving him a 93 mln dlr profit. Goodyear also paid him 37 mln
dlrs for expenses and bought about 41 mln other shares for over
two billion dlrs.
    In an effort to trim its new debt, Goodyear closed down
three plants Mercer believes otherwise could have been saved,
sold its motor wheel and aerospace units and reduced its
payroll by 10 pct, he said.
    Mercer, who plans to testify tomorrow at a Senate hearing
on a proposed bill to control corporate raiders, said hostile
takeovers have also hurt workers.

<TITLE>SOVIET GRAINS SEEN ENTERING SPRING ON SHAKY NOTE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    by Maggie McNeil, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Soviet winter grains could be off to
a faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall
and cold winter, weather and crop analysts said.
    Prospects for another near-record grain harvest in the
Soviet Union appear dim at this point, but it is premature to
forecast any major crop problems, analysts said.
    But the situation bears careful watching over the next six
weeks and will ultimately impact the Soviet grain supply and
future buying plans, analysts of the Soviet Union said.
    "From a weather standpoint, you can say with certainty that
the Soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a
lower crop (than last year)," Gail Martell, chief meteorologist
for E.F. Hutton said.
    The next six weeks in the USSR's grain growing areas will
be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of
the winter crops, Martell and other analysts said.
    "Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of
us," an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said.
    The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectares
of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill.
This would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop
and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years, the
USDA analyst said.
    With a timely spring, Soviet farmers would probably be able
to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops, but analysts
noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops
-- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower.
    Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover
combined with cold temperatures. This winter, however,
snowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent,
so the bulk of winterkill, analysts speculate, likely has been
due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination.
    "Fall dryness may be a problem. There's a good correlation
between mediocre crops and fall dryness," Martell said.
    Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal
in southern and northern Ukraine, and below normal over the
entire winter crop area, she said.
    Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the
snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused 
problems of ice-crusting and winterkill, Jim Candor, senior
forecaster for Accu Weather, said.
    Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the
fall and winter, analysts said. The dry fall damaged pastures,
the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would
require longer off-pasture feeding, they said.
    "The Soviets are not in a desperate situation ... they
don't have to buy (grains) now," a USDA official said.
    But if the Soviets are worried about their winter crops and
if they feel that last year's huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was a
one-time fluke brought on by perfect conditions, more Soviet
buying might occur to insure crop supplies, he said.
    Bad weather during the next six weeks could push the
Soviets back into the market, weather analysts said.
    "A lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and
a half," Martell said.

    The smelter, near Frankfurt, had annual capacity of about
44,000 metric tons but was operating at about half that in
January, spokesman Fernand Leclerc said.
    Leclerc said Alcan decided it would cost too much to
modernize the plant.
    He said there is a possibility the company will sell the
smelter, which currently employs 320 people, before its
scheduled closing.

<TITLE>OIL PRICES RISE ON SAUDI EFFORT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    BY TED D'AFFLISIO, REUTERS</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, MARCH 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Crude oil prices rallied today, moving
over 17.00 dlrs a barrel because of Saudi Arabia's determined
effort to support prices, analysts said.
    "The Saudis and other OPEC nations are jawboning the market,
hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this without
another meeting," said Sanford Margoshes, oil analyst with
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
    "But OPEC is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due to
seasonal declines in demand and some cheating," he added.
    Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attempt
to get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount from
the official prices agreed to last december.
    The analysts said that to get others to hold the line,
Saudi Arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministers
of the Gulf Cooperation Council last weekend and at the
Cooperation Council oil ministers' meeting the previous week.
    The Saudis have also offered to support members having
difficulty in selling their oil, analysts said.
    "They are trying to make sure that no one discounts, and to
prevent that, it appears that Saudi Arabia or some other OPEC
member will allocate some of their oil sales to help members
that lose sales," Margoshes said.
    He added that the allocations would probably be in the form
of loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales.
    Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line
nations like Qatar, which has had trouble selling oil. But it
is also likely that such assistance would be provided to
Nigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts.
    Analysts said that Saudi Arabia, with assistance from OPEC
president Rilwanu Lukman, was trying to avoid an emergency OPEC
meeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the
December pact is falling apart.
    Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Upham
Harris and Co said, "both physical and futures markets have been
oversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a short
covering rally."
    He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo, which
refused discounts to Japanese buyers, brought Japanese refiners
into the market to cover their short positions.
    Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the market
to but 10 cargoes of May Dubai, which sent prices up on Mideast
sours, with Dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after trading
yeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into the
North sea crude oil market.
    Traders said that there have been persistent rumors today
that Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brent
for Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vessels
being fixed to make such shipments.
    North sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with trades
reported as high as 17.05 dlrs, up one dlr.
    OPEC members' denials that they are producing over their
quotas sparked moves to cover short postitions.
    Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPEC
production was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to last
december but he gave no details on OPEC production against
claims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level.
    "The production probably is about their quota level and
largely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sell
its oil as a result," Margoshes said.
    Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the
current rally. Some believe prices can continue to rise if
Saudi Arabia and OPEC hold steady in a refusal to discount.
    But others said that despite the rally today there were
still several fundamental factors, including demand, which
could cut the rally short.
    Marion Stewart, an indepedent petroleum economist, said
slow growth in the economies of the U.S. and OECD would keep
demand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to rise
about 1.4 pct over 1986.

<TITLE>COFFEE MAY FALL MORE BEFORE NEW QUOTA TALKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Douglas Learmond, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Coffee prices may have to fall even lower
to bring exporting and importing countries once more round the
negotiating table to discuss export quotas, ICO delegates and
traders said.
    The failure last night of International Coffee
Organization, ICO, producing and consuming countries to agree
export quotas brought a sharp fall on international coffee
futures markets today with the London May price reaching a
4-1/2 year low at one stage of 1,270 stg per tonne before
ending the day at 1,314 stg, down 184 stg from the previous
close.
    The New York May price was down 15.59 at 108.00 cents a lb.
    Pressure will now build up on producers returning from the
ICO talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hope
the negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floor
under prices, some senior traders said.
    The ICO 15 day average price stood at 114.66 cents a lb for
March 2. This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents
a lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in
February last year following a sharp rise in international
prices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop.
    In a Reuter interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC,
President Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said
they need to make hard commercial decisions. "If we have failed
at the ICO, at least we have tried," Dauster said, adding "now it
is time to go and sell coffee."
    But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open. It plans
to make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next
month, Dauster said. It is too difficult to forecast now. Trade
sources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a
previous crop of 11.2 mln. Brazil is defining details of public
selling tenders for coffee bought on London's futures market
last year.
    A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the
market "in one go" but is sold over a minimum of six months.
    The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split
between producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for
future quotas. Consumers said "objective criteria" like average
exports and stocks should determine producer quota shares,
Dauster said.
    All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but
consumers insisted they did not want a return to the "ad hoc" way
of settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst
producers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO.
    Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and
non-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and
that Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set
ratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings.
    It is a "simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate"
policy to other producers. While consumer countries are welcome
to participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very
difficult to allocate as different "objective criteria" achieve
different share-outs of quota, Dauster said.
    Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO
and at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise.
    Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to
accept the producers' offer to abandon quotas if it proves
impossible to find an acceptable basis for them.
    "We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to
encourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if
supplies are needed at a later stage," one delegate said.
    Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer
argument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO
session but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse
and how much producers will sink their differences should
prices fall further and remain depressed.
    The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but
both producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real
negotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet in
Indonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September.
    More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and
politics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could
bring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than
many imagine. In that case quotas could come into force during
the summer. But most delegates and traders said quotas before
October are unlikely, while Brazil's Dauster noted the ICO has
continued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980.
    A clear difference between the pressures already being felt
by importers and exporters was that consumers would have been
happy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could
not be imposed now. At least in that way they said they could
show a direct relationship between quotas and availability.
    In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug the
seemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to
lapse should lasting agreement not be found.
    "Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their
failure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient
and we wanted a cast iron commitment now," one consumer said.

    The smelter, near Frankfurt, had annual capacity of about

    Leclerc said Alcan decided it would cost too much to

<TITLE>U.S. WINE EXPORTS ROSE 15 PER CENT LAST YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAN FRANCISCO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Exports of American wine rose 14.9
per cent last year to a total of 7.2 million gallons, the Wine
Institute said.
    The San Francisco-based promotional group said 95 per cent
of the exported wine was from California and the top three
markets were Canada, Japan and Britain.
    Japan, which edged out Britain as the leading importer of
American wines in 1985, continued in second place.
    Canadian imports rose 3.2 per cent to 2.6 million gallons;
Japan, 9.9 per cent to 1.2 million gallons, and Britain, 20.2
per cent to 962,360 gallons.
    A spokesman for the institute said the declining value of
the dollar and strong promotional efforts on the part of the
California wine industry contributed significantly to the
increased shipments.
    The 1986 wine exports were valued at 34.7 mln dlrs, up from
27.6 mln dlrs the previous year.

<TITLE>U.S. SENATE PANEL COULD CONSIDER TRADE MEASURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee
may take up a bill tomorrow that would strengthen the
activities of U.S. agricultural trade teams in selected
developing countries, committee staff said.
    The measure, sponsored by committee Chairman Patrick Leahy
(D-Vt.) and Sen. John Melcher (D-Mont.), would establish trade
teams of between six and nine persons drawn from federal
agencies and private voluntary organizations, staff said.
    The trade missions would seek to generate interest in the
U.S. government's food donation and commercial programs --
PL480, Section 416, export credit and export enhancement -- and
upon return be required to advocate extension of concessional
or commercial benefits to interested countries.
    The trade teams would be made up of representatives of the
U.S. Agriculture Department, State Department, the Agency for
International Development and private voluntary organizations
such as U.S. Wheat Associates.
    The bill would require teams within six months to visit
seven countries: Mexico, Philippines, Indonesia, India,
Bangladesh, Senegal and Nigeria.
    Within one year after passage of the measure, another eight
countries would have to be visited: Peru, Kenya, the Dominican
Republic, Costa Rica, Malaysia, Venezuela, Tunisia and Morocco.
Other countries could be added to the list.
    Senate staff members said the bill, still in the drafting
stages, had broad support and was expected to be approved by
the committee tomorrow.

<TITLE>U.S. OFFICIALS SAY BRAZIL SHOULD DEAL WITH BANKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By David Hume, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. is sticking for the moment
to its policy that Brazil, which two weeks ago suspended debt
payments to private banks, should deal with its creditors and
not with governments, U.S. officials said.
    "I don't see any desire here to scurry around and help
Brazil until we get a better sense of what they are trying to
do," a senior administration official stated.
    "Brazil has to do business through the banks at this point,"
said another official following an assessment of that country's
latest debt crisis.
    The official, who asked that his name not be used, said the
National Security Council, the Treasury and State departments
and other agencies held a meeting yesterday to discuss the
situation.
    In a related development, small regional banks that have
made loans to Brazil and other heavily-indebted Latin American
countries, will meet with Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker
here tomorrow.
    Brazil, with about 108 billion dlrs in debt, shocked banks
late last month when it stopped interest payments on 68 billion
dlrs owed to them until it can work out its problems.
    Brazil's trade surplus, its main source of foreign exchange
has dwindled in recent months, making it difficult to service
its debt.
    The official said the interagency meeting was called to
discuss "the general debt situation and compare notes on
(Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson) Funaro."
    Funaro, who told reporters here that he wanted a political
discussion with industrialized nations on Brazil's debt
problems in an effort to obtain more and faster lending from
official sources, held discussions here on Friday with Volcker,
Treasury Secretary James Baker and other officials.
    Another senior administration official said he was
perplexed by Funaro's decision to discuss the latest crisis
with governments and not with creditor banks, at a time when
Brazil is in danger of losing short-term credit lines.
    "We are not clear at all on his tactics. To me it seems
bizarre, just bizarre," the official said.
    One official today described Funaro's argument as "nonsense,"
and said there had been a considerable flow of funds to Brazil,
for which that country was in arrears.
    Funaro has said Brazil acted to protect its reserves but
wanted to avoid a confrontation.
    The consensus among administration officials seems to be
that Brazil's latest debt crisis is the result of the domestic
economic problems.
    "Brazil is a special case, but there's no doubt they would
not be in the mess they're in if they had not screwed-up their
economic policy," a senior official added.
    Several of the regional banks that will meet with Volcker
tomorrow declined to comment because the talks will be held at
the Fed's suggestion.
    "Since they are the hosts, we feel it's up to them if they
want to say something," one regional bank official said.
    But other banking sources said that regional banks, many of
which are refusing to continue lending to Latin America, are
dissatisfied with decisions of major banks such as Citibank, in
the refinancing of foreign debts.
    The sources added that Volcker, for his part, is
dissatisfied with some major banks' refusal to make interest
rate concessions to Brazil and other Latin American debtors,
and would like to see smaller creditor banks take a more actve
role in the rescheduling process.

<TITLE>FCOJ SUPPLIES SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE YEAR AGO-USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Total supply of frozen concentrated
orange juice (FCOJ) in 1986/87 is expected to be significantly
above year-earlier levels, even with carry-in stocks well below
the previous season, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    In a summary of its Fruit Situation Report, the Department
said Florida's imports of FCOJ, mostly from Brazil, have shown
sharp gains to date.
    The Department noted the price of FCOJ will probably be
affected by the final decision, scheduled for April 22, on
whether the U.S. considers Brazilian FCOJ exports to the U.S.
have caused injury.
    Continuing strong demand for fresh and processing fruit
coupled with seasonal declines in supplies mean that grower
prices will remain higher this spring than a year earlier.
    The department said stocks of fresh apples in cold storage
at the beginning of February were moderately larger than a year
earlier, but strong demand has kept apple prices firm.
    In view of the strong demand and seasonally reduced
supplies, apple prices are projected to stay firm.
    During the remainder of 1986/87, supplies of most processed
noncitrus fruit will be smaller than a year ago, it said.
    Movement of canned fruit has improved, and remaining
suppies for some canned fruit items are tight and as a
consequence prices have strengthened, the department said.

<TITLE>U.S. CORN, SORGHUM PAYMENTS 50-50 CASH/CERTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Eligible producers of 1986 crop U.S.
corn and sorghum will receive an estimated 600 mln dlrs in
deficiency payments -- 50 pct in generic commodity certificates
and 50 pct in cash, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    It said corn producers will receive about 515 mln dlrs and
sorghum producers about 85 mln dlrs.
    Only the cash portion of the payments will be subject to
the 4.3 pct reduction in compliance with the Gramm-Rudman
budget deficit control act of 1985, it said.
    Corn and sorghum producers who requested advance deficiency
payments have already received about 2.8 billion dlrs and 225
mln dlrs, respectively, USDA said.
    The Department said deficiency payment rates of 51.5 cents
per bushel for corn and 49 cents per bushel for sorghum were
received by producers requesting advance payments.
    Deficiency payments are calculated as the difference
between an established target price and the higher of the basic
loan rate, or the national average price received by farmers
during the first five months of the marketing year --
September-January.
    National weighted average market prices for the first five
months of the season were 1.46 dlrs per bushel for corn and
1.33 dlrs per bushel for sorghum. Eligible corn producers will
be paid 63 cts per bushel, based on the difference between the
3.03 target price and the 2.40 dlr per bushel basic loan rate.
    Sorghum producers' deficiency payment rate will be 60 cents
per bushel, based on the difference between the 2.88 dlrs per
bushel target price and the 2.28 dlrs per bushel basic loan
rate.
    The deficiency payment rates for both commodities are the
maximum permitted by law, the department said.
    Eligible corn and sorghum producers will receive another
1986 crop deficiency payment in October if the national average
market prices received by farmers during the entire marketing
year for both commodities are below the basic loan rates, the
department said.
    The payments will be issued through local Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service offices, it said.

proposes to rename the "USDA Good" grade of beef to "USDA Select."
    The department said the proposed change is in response to a
petition from Public Voice for Food and Health Policy and would
present a more positive image of this grade of beef and help
calorie-conscious consumers select leaner cuts of meat.
    Under current rules, the "good" grade of meat has less
marbling and fat than the "prime" or "choice" grades, it said.
    Standards for all of the grades would remain unchanged
under the proposal.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TO PAY SUBSIDIES--USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Australian Government will likely
reimburse the Australian Wheat Board, AWB, about 132 mln (U.S.)
dlrs to pay wheat farmers for their 1986/87 crop, the U.S.
Agriculture Department said.
    In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the
department said the sharp fall in world wheat prices has
reduced the export sales revenue of the AWB to levels
insufficient to cover its breakeven export price estimated at
around 98 dlrs per tonne.
     For example the recent large sales of wheat to China (1.5
mln tonnes) and Egypt (2.0 mln tonnes) were well below the
breakeven export price, it said.
    Australian wheat farmers normally receive an advance
payment known as the Guaranteed Minimum Price, GMP, calculated
at 90 pct of the average of estimated returns in the current
year and the two lowest of the previous three years, the
department said.
    In addition, deductions for taxes, freight, handling and
storage are deducted from the GMP the farmer receives.
    But the department said the Australian Bureau of
Agricultural Economics, BAE, predicts wheat production will
drop sharply from 17.8 mln tonnes in 1986/87 to 13.5 mln in
1989/90.
    The decline will result from low world grain prices leading
to shifts to livestock and other crops which could benefit U.S.
wheat exports, the department said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese traders have apparently
sharply reduced commitments to buy Chinese corn over the next
six months due to high prices, the U.S. Agriculture Department
said.
    In its World Production and Trade Report, the department
said traders indicated China may lack supplies or be unwilling
to sell at current low world prices.
    If the reports are confirmed, China's major export
destinations such as USSR, Japan, and South Korea, could
increase purchases of U.S. corn, it said.
    China is currently forecast to export 5.5 mln tonnes of
corn during 1986/87 (Oct-Sept), it said.

other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to stay within their production quotas, said Morgan
Stanley Group managing director John Wellemeyer.
    Wellemeyer, speaking to reporters at an offshore oil
engineering conference, also said he expected OPEC nations to
attempt to hold prices under 20 dlrs a barrel for several years
to keep industrial demand for residual fuel oil strong.
    "Over the next few weeks I think you'll see a concerted
effort by the Saudis to get production down," Wellemeyer said.
    "The Saudis are committed to that price level (of 18 dlrs a
barrel) and are willing to make it happen again," he said.
    In recent weeks, oil prices fell to the 16 to 17 dlrs a
barrel level on market reports of some OPE members producing
above their quota, pushing total OPEC production to 15.8 mln
barrels per day. But prices rebounded today, with April U.S.
crude prices up about one dlr to over 17 dlrs a barrel on a
belief Saudi Arabia is attempting to curb OPEC output.
    Wellemeyer said that sharp declines in U.S. oil production
could push demand for OPEC oil above 20 mln barrels per day as
early as 1989 and up to 24 mln barrels per day by 1993.
    Although the projected increases in demand for OPEC oil
should strengthen world prices, Wellemeyer said he believed the
organization would hold its official price below 20 dlrs a
barrel for some time to prevent residual fuel users from
switching to natural gas supplies. The interfuel swing market
accounts for about eight mln barrels a day, or 18 pct of the
world demand for oil.

<TITLE>EC DRIVING TO CAPTURE BRAZIL WHEAT MARKET - USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community, EC, sold
75,000 tonnes of soft wheat at a subsidized price of between 85
and 89 dlrs per tonne FOB for March delivery in a continuing
bid to establish itself in the Brazilian wheat market, the U.S.
Agriculture Department said.
    The sale sharply undercut the U.S. offer of 112 dlrs per
tonne FOB for 33,000 tonnes of wheat, it said in its latest
report on Export Markets for U.S grains.
    EC sales to Brazil total about 225,000 tonnes during
1986/87 (July-June) in stark contrast to only 50,000 tonnes in
the 1985/86 season, it said.
    The increasing presence of EC wheat in Brazil comes at a
time when the Brazilian Wheat Board, BWB, expects the wheat
import market will expand to 3.4 mln tonnes from the current
forecast of 3.0 mln in the 1986/87 year.
    The BWB cites record consumption and an eventual decline in
domestic production, and says government plans to lower the
guaranteed price of wheat from 242 dlrs per tonne to 180 dlrs
will contribute to greater import demand, the USDA said.
    It said the BWB expects the U.S. to be major supplier of
the additional 400,000 tonnes, but commitments for purchase of
U.S. wheat through two-thirds of 1986/87 year total only
600,000 tonnes versus 700,000 a year ago.

American Pork Congress convention in Indianapolis that refunds
under the legislative checkoff program are running less than
expected.
    The Board oversees collection and distribution of funds
from the checkoff program that was mandated by the 1985 farm
bill. Virgil Rosendale, a pork producer from Illinois and
chairman of the National Pork Board, said over 2.2 mln dlrs was
collected in January and refunds are running almost nine pct,
considerably less than expected.
    "We believe that this indicates good producer support for
the new checkoff. We're getting good compliance from markets,
from packers and from dealers," Rosendale said.

<TITLE>SOUTH AFRICA CORN EXPORTS COULD BE REDUCED-USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Despite earlier optimistic
indications, the South African corn crop is at a critical stage
in its development and recent reports of heat stress could
reduce production and therefore exportable supplies, the U.S.
Agriculture Department said.
    In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the
department said South Africa's corn exports in the 1986/87
(Oct-Sept) season are estimated at 2.5 mln tonnes, up 40 pct
from the previous year.
    The re-emergence of South Africa as a competitor follows a
period of severe droughts, which at one point required South
Africa to import 2.7 mln tones of U.S. corn in 1983/84, it
said.
    Since those imports in 1983/84, the U.S. has been facing
increased competition from South Africa in Taiwan and Japan.
    But if South Africa is perceived as lacking available
supplies, purchases of U.S. corn may be further stimulated, the
department said.

<TITLE>CBT TRADERS LOOK AHEAD TO SPRING PLANTINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chicago Board of trade grain traders and
analysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned to
handle their upcoming spring plantings, prompting sales of new
crop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeans
in the futures markets.
    Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers will
be more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans because
corn is protected by the acreage reduction program. That gives
deficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low.
    Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if they
sign-up for reduced acreage, but they have no price guarantees.
    With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal,
traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thing
rather than gamble on soybeans, even though the new crop
soybean/corn ratio of 2.9/1 would make planting soybeans more
attractive under normal circumstances.
    An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift the
limited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop,
means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mln
more oat acres this year than last without being penalized,
traders said.
    Here too, acres some farmers may have been thinking of
shifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats, due to the
more attractive deal from the government, they added.
    Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just six
months ago, which should prompt many farmers in the South to
put soybean land back into cotton.
    One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybean
production in recent years has been a general shift of acres in
traditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans,
which are easier to grow, one commercial trader said.

expected to take up a bill tomorrow that would exempt from
government conservation regulations those farmers who have
rotated alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes with
row crops, committee staff said.
    Under current so-called "sodbuster" law, farmers who planted
alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes on highly
erodible land in the years 1981 through 1985 lose federal farm
program benefits if they produce a row crop on that land in
later years.
    Sen. Edward Zorinsky (D-Neb.), sponsor of the measure, said
recently that those crop rotating practices resulted in less
erosion than the practices of many farmers who produced
strictly row crops.

    CTC, a group of Canadian Tire dealers, which already owns
17 pct of Canadian Tire, is currently appealing in an Ontario
court against a previously announced Ontario Securities
Commission ruling blocking CTC's 272 mln dlr bid.
    The blocked bid did not include non-voting shareholders,
who hold 96 pct of Canadian Tire equity.

<TITLE>ROCKWELL &lt;ROK> SEES IMPROVEMENT IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Rockwell International Corp
continues to expect significant improvement in 1987 results,
despite the somewhate disappointing performance of one of its
business segments, President Donald Beall told Reuters.
    Rockwell reported net earnings in its first quarter ended
December 31 of 149.4 mln dlrs, or 1.05 dlrs per share, compared
to 125.8 mln dlrs, or 84 cts per share a year ago.
    Operating earnings, however, were off about four pct, and
analysts have attributed the decline to Rockwell's
Allen-Bradley unit, which has suffered from weakness in the
industrial automation market.
    "It is in a soft market now, but we are not concerned. It
is moving forward with market development and is enhancing
market share," Beall said of Allen-Bradley unit.
    Beall, who was in Los Angeles to address a Technology
management conference, said first quarter sales for the
Allen-Bradley unit were flat as compared to a year earlier. He
said the company does not break out operating earnings by unit
on a quarterly basis.
    Beall said the recent trend toward cost sharing in the
research and development phase of government contracts should
not have a major impact on Rockwell's near-term performance.
    He noted, however, the increasing focus on cost sharing
could limit technological innovation.
    "I worry that we are heading into a period of misuse of
contracting approaches too early in the development stages of
important military contracts," Beall said, adding, "long-term,
we have a very serious problem."
    In addition, Beall told the conference the greatest
competitive threat to defense contractors is in defense
electronics, due to the government's attempt to take advantage
of competitively priced products made outside the U.S.

<TITLE>SWAP DEALERS UNVEIL STANDARD CONTRACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    London, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The International Swap Dealers
Association has developed the first standard form contract for
use by arrangers of currency and interest rate swap
transactions, said Thomas Jasper, the Association's
co-chairman.
    The contract, unveiled at a press conference , is expected
to make the 300 billion dlr a year swap market more efficient,
he said. "The contracts wil accelerate the process and reduce
the expense of swap documentation," Japsper said.
    Privately, eurobond traders estimate that about 80 pct of
all new issues eventually become part of either an interest
rate or currency swap.
    An interest rate swap occurs when two issuers, usually
acting through a bank middleman, agree to accept each other's
interest payments on debt securities. Usually, the issuer of a
floating rate debt security swaps into fixed-rate debt and vice
versa. But the obligation for repayment of the debt remains
with the original borrower.
    Bank regulators have become concerned about the use of
swaps because the middleman, usually a bank, takes on some
portion of the risk but is not required to show it on the
balance sheet as a liability and may not have sufficient
capital to cushion it.
    Kenneth McCormick, a co-chairman of the ISDA and president
of Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc, said the Bank of
England and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board were expected later
today to announce joint proposals for setting minimum capital
standards for counterparties in swaps.
    The standards are part of the recently announced
convergence agreement between the two countries in which
regulators have attempted to set similar capital requirements
for institutions.
    McCormick told reporters the ISDA was concerned that a
"level playing field" be maintained in the swaps market.
    He said if U.K. And U.S. Banks were required to hold more
primary capital against swap transactions than is the current
practice, the additional costs would have to be passed on to
issuers.
    The issuers might then choose to do business with
lower-cost banks which are not subject to U.S. Or U.K. Banking
rules.
    He said the ISDA had been working on a code of conduct for
swap dealers as part of its self-regulatory effort.
    That code should be completed within the next few weeks, he
said.

BellSouth Corp &lt;BLS> unit Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph
Co's decision to postpone the start up of new conversion
assignments at Geonex's Chicago Aerial Survey unit could
negatively affect its fiscal 1987 revenues.
    The company said it had expected higher revenues from the

Southern Bell work at about eight mln dlrs, the same level as
last fiscal year.
    Geonex said Southern Bell will let CAS continue work in
progress and it expects to perform mechanized posting and
records conversion for Southern Bell through 1989.
    But, it added that the Southern Bell decision has forced it
to pursue opportunities with other telephone companies and
municipalities to replace the Southern Bell work.

<DATELINE>    ROME, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Italian treasury said it will issue
3,000 billion lire of a new type of indexed government paper,
discount certificates (CTS), on March 18.
    Treasury Minister Giovanni Goria said at a news conference
the new certificates will be heavily discounted and aimed at
small investors rather than institutions.
    The Treasury said in a statement the annual yield of the
seven-year certificates will be indexed to 50 pct of the annual
yield of 12-month treasury bills.
    Effective annual yield after tax for the first CTS issue
will be 9.66 pct. "The launch of the new certificate has to be
viewed in the framework of the management of the public debt as
a step towards the return of a larger volume of fixed-rate
issues," the Treasury said.
    The Treasury said future CTS issues likely would be
certificates longer than seven years. CTS automatically offers
a portfolio diversification between fixed-rate and
variable-rate investments.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Shin-Etsu Chemical Co Ltd said it had
developed an ultra thermal resistance rubber which can be used
at 250 centigrade continuously without losing its properties.
    Shin-Etsu put potential demand for the product at two
tonnes a month mainly for microwave ovens and as a sealant.
    But increasing use of the product in parts attached to car
engines will raise demand and the company will boost output to
10 tonnes by March 1988 from two now, he said.

<TITLE>GREECE PLANS TO REDUCE 1987 FOREIGN BORROWING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ATHENS, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Greece aims to reduce foreign borrowing
to 1.6 or 1.7 billion dlrs this year from 2.6 billion in 1986,
and will use some of the funds to make early debt servicing
payments, the Governor of the Bank of Greece, Dimitris
Halikias, said.
    He told reporters this year's borrowing forecast exceeded
immediate needs, but Greece wanted to take advantage of low
international interest rates in order to make servicing
payments at a lower cost.
    Greece's foreign debts totalled 16.8 billion dlrs at
end-1986, up from 15.2 billion at end-1985, Halikias said.
    He said the extra funds available to Greece this year will
go towards servicing debts falling due after 1990. He did not
give figures.
    He said Greece was able to cut borrowing because a two-year
austerity program it adopted in October, 1985 cut its current
account deficit to 1.75 billion dlrs last year from a record
3.3 billion in 1985.
    Halikias said he was "fairly optimistic" Greece would reach a
current account deficit target of 1.25 billion dlrs this year.
    He said domestic demand has fallen, reducing the need for
imports, while Greek exports are becoming more competitive.
    Economy Ministry figures show exports rose to 4.9 billion
dlrs in the first 11 months of 1986 from 4.1 billion in the
same. 1985 period, while imports dipped to 10.2 billio dlrs
from 11.4 billion.

<TITLE>B.C. RESOURCES HAS AGREEMENT ON CREDIT FACILITY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;British Columbia
Resources Investment Corp>, earlier reporting higher full year
operating losses, said it reached agreement in principle with
five lenders providing for a 360 mln dlr credit facility over a
four year term.
    The company said the credit facility is extendable under
certain circumstances, with annual principal payments of five
mln dlrs. The agreement is subject to certain lender approvals
and completion of formal documentation.
    It earlier reported 1986 losses before extraordinary items
rose to 26.4 mln dlrs from year-ago 7.2 mln dlrs.
    B.C. Resources also said dividends on its series 2
preferred shares and exchangeable preferred shares will remain
suspended.
    However, payment will be made on account of the quarterly
dividend on the exchangeable preferred shares by the company's
trustee from a deposit account, B.C. Resources said.
    Sufficient funds should be available to pay full amount of
the March 31, 1987 dividend to exchangeable preferred
shareholders, with payment expected in early April to
shareholders of record March 31, the company said.
    If future dividends are not declared after the April
exchangeable preferred quarterly payout, future payment will
depend on the amount of dividends received from Westcoast
Transmission Co &lt;WTC>, B.C. Resources said.
    The company said its increased fourth quarter and full year
operating losses primarily resulted from lower oil prices and a
four month labor shutdown at its Balmer coal mine in British
Columbia.
    B.C. Resources also recorded a 99.9 mln dlr extraordinary
loss, which included losses on disposition of North Sea oil and
gas interests by 67 pct owned &lt;Westar Mining Ltd>.
    B.C. Resources' 1986 extraordinary charge also included a
writedown of its investment in Westar Petroleum. Gains on the
sales of Westar Timber's Skeena and Celgar pulp mills and
Terrace sawmill partially offset the extraordinary loss, the
company said.
    The company said the asset sales have eliminated B.C.
Resources' long term financing commitment in the North Sea and
exposure to the fluctuating pulp market.
    It also said it cut long term debt in 1986 to 900 mln dlrs
from 1.3 billion dlrs at year-end 1985, and management changes
and staff cuts have significantly reduced costs.

<TITLE>WILLIAMS &lt;WMB> HAS 4TH QTR CHARGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TULSA, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Williams Cos said a fourth quarter charge
of 250 mln dlrs from discontinued operations and writedowns
contributed to a 1986 net loss of 240 mln dlrs or 6.97 dlrs a
share against earnings of 31.6 mln dlrs or 92 cts in 1985.
    The loss in the quarter was 232.3 mln dlrs or 6.75 dlrs
against income of 10.7 mln dlrs or 31 cts a year ago. Revenues
in the quarter fell to 521.1 mln dlrs from 716.9 mln and in the
year fell to 1.9 billion dlrs from 2.5 billion in 1985.
    Williams also said the previously announced sale of its
Agrico Chemical Co unit to Freeport-Mcmoran Resource Partners
Ltd has cleared antitrust review and should close next week.
    The 1987 first quarter will include proceeds from the
Agrico sale, for 250 mln dlrs cash at closing plus deferred
payments, and proceeds of 320 mln dlrs from the sale of a stake
in Peabody Holding Co, completed in January.
    In the 1986 first quarter, Williams reported net of 14.2
mln dlrs or 41 cts a share on sales of 796.4 mln dlrs.
    Williams said the charges in the current year were related
to an ongoing restructuring. The company said the restructuring
moves had improved its balance sheet and improved the outlook
for future stability and growth in earnings.
    Operating profit at the company's Northwest Pipeline Corp
unit fell 4.5 pct to 150 mln dlrs from lower sales. The
Williams Natural Gas unit had operating profit of 50.5 mln dlrs
compared to 90.9 mln dlrs on lower sales volumes.
    Profit at Williams Gas Marketing rose to 26 mln dlrs from
about 22 mln and the William Pipe Line Co had operating profit
of 49.4 mln dlrs versus 63.6 mln dlrs a year ago.

<TITLE>VENEZUELA SETS FOREIGN DEBT TARGETS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CARACAS, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Venezuela plans to have a public sector
foreign debt of 26.5 billion dlrs by early 1989 when the
present government of President Jaime Lusinchi ends its term,
public finances director Jorge Marcano said.
    He said the target, which compares with around 24.5 billion
dlrs now and 29 billion at end 1983, is considered a manageable
amount which will assist in development plans.
    The government last week reached agreement with its 13-bank
advisory committee to reprogramme its 12-1/2 year rescheduling
accord over 14 years with the interest margin lowered to 7/8
pct over London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) from 1-1/8 pct.
    In an interview with El Universal newspaper, Marcano said
he thought U.S. Government pressure on banks had more to do
with the unexpectedly speedy agreement than Brazil's decision
to suspend interest payments.
    "I think what speeded an agreement was the attitude of the
U.S. Government, which urged several major banks to soften
their position in various debt renegotiations. The Brazil
announcement came later," he said.
    Bankers noted Citibank had held up an agreement with Chile,
objecting to proposals for delayed interest payments. A pact
with Chile, with a one pct spread, came a day before
Venezuela's.
    Marcano said a telex sent to Venezuela's 450 creditors
seeks support for the government's foreign borrowing plans,
which are aimed at aluminium, steel and iron ore projects. "We
cannot rule out a trip to financial centres to explain the new
agreement and present the financing programmes we have," he
said, adding he hoped to restore credit ratings of the 1970s.
    Lusinchi said on Monday the government will limit foreign
borrowing, which would come from banks and multilateral
agencies, to 50 pct of interest and principal paid in the next
two years. According to the restructured accord, this would
work out at around 2.5 billion dlrs.

<TITLE>SENATE'S PROXMIRE URGES CURBS ON TAKEOVERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Senate Banking Committee chairman
William Proxmire called for curbs of hostile corporate
takeovers and new restrictions on risk arbitrageurs.
    "At the very least, it is high time that we require all risk
arbitrageurs to register seperately and specifically  with the
Securities and Exchange Commission and that we consider
precluding brokerage firms and their employers from investing
in, or owning any securities issued by, third party risk
arbitrage operations," Proxmire said at the start of a hearing
on corporate takeovers.
    "A burning issue must be whether there ought to be a
complete seperation in the future of risk arbitrage and
investment banking," Proxmire said.
    He said he was concerned that hostile takeover attempts
were hurting the economy, a view shared by corporate executives
who tesitified at the hearing. "I believe that takeovers have
become so abusive and so tilted in favor of the financial
buccaneers that remedial action is required," USX Corp chairman
David Roderick said. "For Congress to allow the takeover game to
continue unchecked, would be economic suicide," Champion
International Corp chairman Andrew Sigler added.

<TITLE>SPAIN TO LAUNCH EXPORT DRIVE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MADRID, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Spain unveils a 105 billion peseta plan
this month aimed at boosting exports to reach European
Community levels, director-general of the INFE export
institute, Apolonio Ruiz Ligero, said.
    "The target is to raise exports to 20 pct of Gross Domestic
Product over the next four years compared to 15 pct now," he
said.
     "This is the minimum prevailing level in the EC and there
is no reason why we should lag behind countries like Italy,
which have a similar productive structure," he said.
    The plan calls for providing soft loans, tax cuts and other
fiscal benefits to exporters and raising Spain's presence in
international trade fairs.
    Consumer goods such as fashion and wine, as well as
traditional industrial exports will be promoted.
    Ruiz Ligero said INFE would double its annual budget to 20
billion pesetas to finance the four-year plan, while the
government's development aid fund (FAD) would provide a special
25 billion peseta grant.
    The plan calls for boosting exports by five to six pct in
real terms this year after a 7.4 pct decline last year.
    Ruiz Ligero attributed this drop to a lack of demand in
developing countries and a rally in domestic consumer demand,
which rose six pct last year after 1.9 pct in 1985.
    He added that 80 pct of Spain's exports went to
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
countries.
    The EC accounts for 60 pct of the market and exports to the
Community rose seven pct last year. The government plans to
concentrate efforts on Western Europe and the U.S.
    "The problem is convincing businessmen that exports are
vital to survival in the context of EC competition," he said.
    He said Spanish businessmen traditionally turned to the
domestic market to satisfy rises in consumer demand, while
turning their backs on foreign markets.
    "They have to realise their share of the home market is
going to shrink with growing deregulation," he said. "Foreign
companies are taking up positions in the domestic economy and
it is it vital to secure a market share abroad."

<TITLE>VEREINS- UND WESTBANK TO REORGANIZE NETWORK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HAMBURG, March 4 - Vereins- </DATELINE><BODY>und Westbank AG &lt;VHBG.F> plans
to streamline its branch network to improve its distribution of
financial services, management board member Eberhard-Rainer
Luckey said.
    He told a news conference on 1986 results that branches in
Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein would be merged or closed, a
branch in Frankfurt opened and that the bank was considering
opening a branch in London.
    Luckey said the bank's total operating profits rose nearly
29 pct in 1986. Parent bank net profit rose to 47.7 mln from
42.2 mln and the dividend remained unchanged at 12 marks.
    The group balance sheet, including for the first time
VereinWest Overseas Finance (Jersey), rose 9.2 pct to 17.9
billion marks, Luckey said.
    The parent bank balance sheet rose 89 mln marks to 13.2
billion, while business volume was almost unchanged at 14.8
billion. Credit volume eased to 9.1 billion from 9.2 billion
while loans to companies rose seven pct.
    Foreign business and securities trading turnover also
increased. Higher earnings from trading on the bank's own
account contributed to record operating profits.
    Net interest income rose on firmer interest margins by 16.1
mln marks to 381.6 mln. Net commission income rose 6.6 mln to
156.7 mln, Luckey said.
    Foreign commercial business was influenced by a fall in
West German foreign trade but earnings were still satisfactory.
    The bank's exposure in Latin America was less than two pct
of its total foreign credit and in Africa less than one pct.
    The bank continued to sell some of its exposure in 1986,
and will also continue to stock up risk provisions, he said.

    Speaking to the President's Export Council, an industry
advisory group, Baldrige said the trade deficit issue was under
discussion with those countries.
    "I feel that unless we see an exchange rate adjustment we
probably won't be able to see much of a change in the large
surplus that Taiwan in particular has with us," he said.
    In a wide-ranging discussion on U.S. trade matters,
Baldrige also repeated U.S. concern about an attempted takeover
by Japan's Fujitsu company of Fairchild Computer.
    He said that the Japanese were resisting allowing U.S.
companies into the giant computer business while at the same
time attempting to acquire control of a U.S. company that does
major computer business in the U.S. market.
    Lastly, Baldrige said that the United States was hopeful
that it could complete a free market agreement with Canada by
the autumn, but said major issues, including acid rain,
remained unresolved.

<TITLE>CASTLE AND COOKE &lt;CKE> TAKES FOURTH QTR LOSS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Castle and Cooke Inc said it would
take a fourth quarter after-tax loss of 33.9 mln dlrs from the
previously reported sale of its Flexi-Van container leasing
business to Itel Corp &lt;ITEL> for about 215 mln dlrs.
    Earlier, the company reported a loss for the fourth quarter
ended January 3 of 31.9 mln dlrs, or 76 cts a share, compared
with a loss of 3.3 mln dlrs, or 21 cts per share, in 1985's
fourth quarter.
    For the year, however, the diversified holding company
reported a net profit of 43.9 mln dlrs, or 56 cts a share,
versus 46.4 mln dlrs, or 56 cts a share, in 1985.
    David Murdock, chairman and chief executive officer, said,
"Both our food business and our real estate operations
increased their earnings during the year (1986)."
    But, he added that Flexi-Van's 1986 results were hit by
depressed daily rental rates for leased equipment caused by
oversupplies.
    The company also reported that George Elkas, formerly
executive vice president,  has been named president and chief
operating officer of Flexi-Van Corp, while William Burns has
been named executive vice president of Flexi-Van.

affirmed the BB-plus rating on AFG Industries Inc's 185 mln
dlrs of subordinated debt.
    S and P said it believed AFG would make acquisitions of
moderate size in the next few years. AFG's healthy cash flow
and pro forma cash balances of 169 mln dlrs at September 30,
1986, should be adequate to fund internal expansion and
moderate acquisitions.
    While AFG's participation in a 1.4 billion dlr bid for Lear
Siegler Inc was aggressive, AFG was mainly interested in Lear's
profitable auto glass operations, S and P noted.

<TITLE>U.K. ONE BILLION STG BOND ISSUE EXHAUSTED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>A one billion stg issue of nine pct
Exchequer stock due 2002 which became available for trading
only this morning was exhausted in mid-afternoon trading on the
U.K. Government bond market, dealers said.
    The Bank of England said the issue was no longer operating
as a tap. The issue was announced Monday at a price of 96 stg
pct and dealers said the Government broker's supplies were sold
out this afternoon at a partly-paid 20-20/32 stg pct. The bonds
started trading this morning at 20 stg pct.
    Dealers noted the market had seen vigorous demand
throughout the day, prompted mainly by sterling strength.
    Dealers said that demand had been seen for the tap from
both domestic and overseas sources, including from Japan and
the U.S.
    Although the issue had not been designated as free of tax
to residents abroad (FOTRA) widespread bullish sentiment for
the market in general had generated foreign buying.
    The stock had been regarded as slightly expensive when it
was announced and dealers said that even first thing this
morning it had seemed slightly dear in relation to comparable
existing stocks.
    However, sterling's continuing firm performance had
prompted interest in the tap right at the outset.
    The issue's value had been enhanced by its partly-paid
structure, which not only enabled investors to defer payment of
the major part of the price until April 27, but also conferred
a substantial gearing element.
    This meant, dealers explained, that investors who bought
the bonds benefitted fully from price gains registered by the
market in general, although only 20 stg pct of the total
purchase price was tied up initially.

a plan to allow member countries to ban regular leaded gasoline
in a move designed to encourage use of unleaded fuel.
    It said in a statement it backed a proposal to allow EC
states to ban sales of regular grade gasoline containing lead
at six months notice. The proposal, which needs approval by EC
ministers, would not force any member state to impose the ban.
"It's an option, not an obligation," a spokesman said.
    But the Commission said imposing the ban would encourage
the use of unleaded fuel, as well as making it easier for gas
stations by cutting the number of types of gasoline they had to
stock.

<TITLE>U.S. TREASURY AIDE WARNS ON INFLATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Thomas Berger, Deputy Assistant
Secretary of the Treasury, said that a further drop in the
exchange value of the dollar could cause prices to go up and
trigger inflation.
    He told a meeting of the President's Export Council that
the Japanese and the Germans have cut their profit margins to
reflect recent drops in the dollar, so prices have remained
much the same.
    But he added that if the dollar dropped further there could
be inflation in the United States.
    Berger also said that a further devalued dollar may cause
economic depressions in some U.S. trading partners, and that
would not be in America's interest because it would close those
markets to U.S. goods.

<TITLE>LEAF DISEASE HITS SRI LANKA RUBBER</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Feizal Samath, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    COLOMBO, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>A leaf disease affecting seven pct of
Sri Lanka's rubber plantations may reduce output this year and
raise currently depressed prices, industry officials and
researchers told Reuters.
    About 2,900 hectares of rubber planted with the Rubber
Research Institute (RRI) clone 103 have been hit by the fungus
"corenes pora" which attacks the roots of the tree and kills the
leaves. The disease was first discovered about six months ago.
    Trade sources say prices might boom once again if the
crisis leads to output below the 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes.
Last year's output is estimated at between 133,000 and 135,000
tonnes.
    Researchers say the fungus could spread to other rubber
clones if no immediate action is taken.
    "The RRI is considering asking estates to remove the trees
seriously affected by the fungus because it was too late to use
chemicals to kill the disease," an Institute spokesman said.
    Senior industry and research officials met yesterday at
Padukka, east of here, to discuss ways of controlling the
fungus which is affecting estates mostly belonging to the State
Plantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board.
    The two state-owned groups account for 30 pct of rubber
land with the balance belonging to small private producers with
a total of 145,600 hectares.
    The RRIC 103 is a new clone propagated by the Research
Institute as high yielding and recommended two years ago for
planting. Only the two state groups seriously planted these
clones while smallholders preferred the low-yielding but older
PBX Malaysian clones.
    Officials at yesterday's crisis meeting said it was decided
to uproot only some of the affected trees while others would be
treated. They declined to comment on other decisions taken.
    Trade sources said supplies had improved in the past week
but prices had hit their lowest since last December. "If there
is a shortage of rubber, prices are bound to rise," a spokesman
for a company buying on behalf of the Soviet Union said.
    Rubber prices, particularly crepe, fell sharply by about
four rupees a kilo between December and March. The best crepe
one-X traded at 23.68 rupees a kilo, averaged 19.75 at this
week's auction. Sheet prices fell by a rupee in the same
period.
    Quantities offered at the auction also fell to an average
of 300 tonnes per auction last month from 800 tonnes in
December because of wintering in early February in producing
areas.
    Over 550 tonnes were offered at this Tuesday's auction with
the supply position showing improvements.
    Trade sources said the smaller availability of rubber last
month did not raise prices as on previous occasions.
    "Some factors, like less storage space from excess stocks,
meant we could not buy much at the auction until we disposed of
the rubber we already had," one buyer said.
    Other sources said there were few forward contracts and
speculative buying last month, while delays in steamer arrivals
aggravated the problem.
    European buyers delayed their purchases because of winter
closures of factories and also in the hope that prices would
ease further.
    They said another problem that could hit the industry is
the dry spell in producing areas. "If the inter-monsoonal rains
expected in late March/April are delayed, we would have further
shortages," one official said.
    "But this again could benefit prices," a buyer said.

<TITLE>GERMAN INSTITUTE SEES INFLATION RISING IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HAMBURG, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The cost of living in West Germany will
likely be about 0.5 pct higher on average in 1987 than in 1986,
when the cost of living actually fell by an average 0.2 pct in
the first recurrence of "negative inflation" since the 1950s, the
HWWA economic research institute said.
    The re-emergence of inflation will result mainly from the
fading of two factors which influenced the fall in the 1986
cost of living - the steep decline in both oil prices and the
value of the dollar, the institute said in a report.
    The institute said inflation will see a rising trend in the
course of 1987, but will average only 0.5 pct for the year as a
whole because year on year rates will remain negative in the
first part of 1987.
    Provisional inflation figures for February released last
week showed the cost of living last month was 0.5 pct lower
than in February 1986. In January prices had fallen 0.8 pct
against the same month a year earlier.
    The HWWA said its forecast assumed the dollar would remain
around 1.80 marks and oil prices would range between 15 and 17
dlrs per barrel.

<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Latin American debtor nations are
still willing to negotiate on their debts, World Bank director
for Latin America and the Caribbean Rainer Steckhan said.
    In an article published in today's Handelsblatt daily,
Steckhan said despite decisions by Peru, Costa Rica, Ecuador
and Brazil to suspend some interest payments, these nations
were still willing to talk constructively about their debts.
    "These countries are still prepared to negotiate, and the
instruments of cooperation developed thus far provide the means
to deal with the crisis over time," Steckhan said.
    Several highly indebted nations have made great efforts to
meet their debt payments, especially Latin American countries,
Steckhan said.
    Chile achieved gross national product growth of five to six
pct last year and quadrupled its trade surplus from 1984,
despite lower prices of key commodity exports like copper.
    Mexico, hit by a catastrophic earthquake and declines in
world oil prices also boosted its non-oil exports by one third
in 1986, the highest growth rate in its post-war history.
    The World Bank's annual lending to Latin America rose to
4.8 billion dlrs last year from three billion in 1984, he said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>FED DRAFTS CURRENCY, RATE SWAP RISK GAUGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Reserve Board voted
unanimously to propose a formula for calculating the risk of
interest rate and currency swaps as part of its ongoing effort
to come up with a new capital standard for U.S. banks that
takes into account the riskiness of a bank's loans and other
assets.
    Fed officials said an identical proposal was being issues
today by the Bank of England.
    The Fed set a 60-day period for public comment on the plan.
    The proposal adopted today addresses only the credit risks
associated with interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange
contracts and similar financial instruments.
    Previously, the Fed Jan. 8 proposed a series of guidelines
for calculating the risk of other off-balance-sheet activities
that banks would be required to take into account in
calculating the minimum financial cushion they would need to
maintain.
    Both guidelines set five broad categories of risk for loans
and other bank assets and assigned to each a level of risk that
would establish a bank's minimum capital needs.
    The additional guidelines proposed today would determine
the amount of capital support required for a bank's current
exposure for a given asset and the potential future exposure.
    The current exposure would be measured by the
mark-to-market value of the asset, which would reflect the
replacement cost.
    Potential future increases in the replacement cost would be
calculated using credit conversion factors based on statistical
analyses by the staffs of the Bank of England and U.S. banking
regulators. Future exposure would rise over the life of the
asset.
    The Fed staff said the risk gauge attempted to balance
conflicting needs for precision and simplicity.
    They ignore, for example, the relative volatility of the
particular currencies involved in exchange rate contracts.
    Board officials said the new gauge could increase the
capital required of the largest money center banks, which are
the principal participants in these types of activities.
    They cautioned the Fed board to take account of the
potential impact of the plan on the ability of U.S. banks to
compete in world financial markets.
    However, the staff concluded, "The credit risks inherent in
such contracts now constitute a significant element of the risk
profiles of some banking organizations."
    The Fed proposal would exempt all but the 20-25 largest
participants in this market, on grounds the benefits of
including the smaller banks would be outweighed by costs.
    Also excluded would be interest rate and foreign exchange
contracts traded on organized exchanges.
    Governor Martha Seger said she was concerned that Japan was
not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new capital
rules.

<TITLE>JANUARY CRUDE OIL MOVEMENTS FALL SEVEN MLN TONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Worldwide spot crude oil movements fell
to 30.07 mln long dwt in February from 37.25 mln tons in
January and 41.44 mln in December, London shipbroker Howard
Houlder said.
    The decline mainly reflected a sharp drop in movements out
of the Mideast Gulf, which totalled 7.4 mln tons last month
against 11.65 mln in January. These included shipments to
western options at 2.05 mln tons against 3.59 mln previously.
    Liftings from the Gulf to eastern options fell to 4.15 mln
tons from 5.94 mln and those from the Gulf to other areas
dropped to 1.2 mln tons from 2.13 mln, Howard Houlder said.
    U.K./Continent coastal movements declined sharply to 2.91
mln tons from 4.77 mln but those from the U.K./Continent to the
U.S. rose to 1.99 mln from 1.69 mln.

<TITLE>EC SOURCES DETAIL NEW FARM SOCIAL PACKAGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     BRUSSELS, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The 350 mln Ecu three-year package of
social and structural measures agreed early today by European
Community farm ministers features a plan to compensate farmers
for reducing output of certain surplus products, EC Commission
sources said.
    The ministers agreed that under this "extensification"
scheme, farmers would qualify for compensation if they cut
output of specific products by at least 20 pct.
    The plan would initially apply to cereals, beef, veal and
wine, they added.
    Cereals farmers would have to achieve their output cuts by
reducing acreage, while cattle farmers would reduce their
number of head and vinegrowers would cut yield. In each case,
farmers would have to undertake not to step up their capacity
for output of other products which are in surplus in the EC.
    The sources said payment levels have not yet been fixed but
will be designed to compensate farmers for loss of profit on
the production they forego.
    The sources said the package also contains provisions for
payments to farmers who embark on a program aimed at protecting
or improving the environment.
    It would also mean compensatory allowances in less favoured
farming areas would be extended to crops. At present such
allowances are available only for livestock.
    The package would provide 20 mln Ecus for research into
alternative farming techniques, the sources added.
    At a news conference EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen
said the Commission is also working on proposals to enable the
EC and member states to provide direct income supports for
relatively poor farmers.
    Andriessen did not give full details, but said member state
aid would be subject to "strict criteria to avoid distortion of
competition."
    EC payments would aim to help farmers to survive a
difficult period while the EC tackles the problems of surplus
production.
    The Commission withdrew from the package agreed last night
proposals to pay "early retirement" pensions to farmers aged 55
or over who gave up production. Those who took their land
completely out of farm production, rather than passing it on to
their heirs, would have received more generous payments.
    Andriessen said the Commission plans to present revised
proposals along these lines in an effort to get a scheme
agreed.

<TITLE>U.S., BRITAIN AGREE FURTHER BANK CAPITAL PROPOSALS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England and the U.S. Federal
Reserve Board have agreed new proposals for joint standards to
measure the risk of an array of credit exposures that do not
show up in bank balance sheets, the Bank of England said.
    The plan, covering swaps, forward contracts and options
involving interest or exchange rates, complements proposals
agreed in January between the two central banks to make
commercial banks in the U.S. And Britain subject to similar
standards for measuring capital adequacy, the proposal said.
    It said no final decisions had been reached yet and banks
have until April 16 to comment on the trunk proposals.
    The Bank of England and Fed said they had faced a dilemma.
    "On the one hand (we) are determined to require adequate
capital support for potential future exposure -- on the other
hand (we) are concerned that overly stringent capital
requirements might unnecessarily affect the ability of U.S. And
U.K. Banking organisations to price...Contracts competitively."
     At the basis of the new proposals lies the concept of the
so-called credit equivalent amount - the current value of a
currency or interest rate contract and an estimate of its
potential change in value due to currency or interest rate
fluctuations until the contract matures.
    In treatment similar to that agreed in January for balance
sheet assets, the credit equivalent will be assigned one of
five risk weights between zero and 100 pct, depending on the
quality of the counterparty, the remaining maturity of the
contract and on collaterals or guarantees to the contract, the
plans showed.
    The proposal showed that collaterals and guarantees would
not be recognised in calculating credit equivalent amounts.
    They would, however, be reflected in the assignment of risk
weights. The only guarantees recognised are those given by U.S.
And U.K. Governments or, in the U.S., By domestic national
government agencies, the proposals showed.
    The paper said the proposed rules would not cover spot
foreign exchange contracts and securities traded in futures and
options exchanges.
    It said U.S. Regulatory authorities and the Bank of England
were keen to encourage banks to "net" contracts -- consolidate
multiple contracts with the same counterparty into one single
agreement to create one single payments stream.
    It recognised that "such arrangements may in certain
circumstances reduce credit risk and wish to encourage their
further development and implementation," and said some of the
current proposals may be changed to take this into account.

flexibility on dividends, and trustees will now consider the
appropriateness of any dividend increases only during the later

    Some varieties of winter wheat sown in Poland can survive

    Even though an earlier thin protective layer of snow mainly
melted in February, air temperatures down to minus 30 C should
not be harmful, she said, but added that wheat can still be
damaged by cold spells in March and April, when young shoots
may be exposed to night frosts.

<DATELINE>    STAMFORD, Conn, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Great Northern Nekoosa Corp
said it will recommend to shareholders a two-for-one common
stock split.
    The company said it will make the proposal to shareowners
at its annual mmeting May 6 in Dothan, Ala., near the company's
Great Southern Paper division operations.
    In conjunction with the stock split proposal, the
shareowners will be asked to approve an increase in the
authorized common stock from 60 mln to 150 mln shares, the
company said.
    The company said it will propose an increase in its
dividend rate if the split is approved effective with the June
payment.
    The company said the present rate on GNN common is 43 cts
per share. The company said it would recommend a quarterly rate
of 23 cts a share on the split stock. This would be equal to a
dividend of 46 cts a share on the present common, seven pct
higher than the current rate.
    The company said it had increased the dividend by 13 pct
last December. Great Northern Nekoosa's last common stock
split, a three-for-two, was in December 1983, it said.
    As of Dec 31, 1986, there were 26,661,770 shares of GNN
common stock outstanding, according to the company.

<TITLE>COFFEE TALKS FAILURE SEEN PRESSURING U.S.</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Greg McCune, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Failure of talks on re-establishing
International Coffee Organization, ICO, coffee quotas last week
may put political pressure on the United States, particularly
the State Department, to reassess its position, but the U.S. is
unlikely to back away from its basic demand quotas be set by
"objective criteria", U.S. officials said.
    Jon Rosenbaum, assistant U.S. trade representative and head
of Washington's delegation to the talks, told Reuters on his
return from London that the United States is willing to resume
the coffee negotiations as early as April if necessary.
    Rosenbaum said the United States will be "flexible" in
discussing the method of establishing objective criteria and
any transition to new quotas, but not on the basic aim of
establishing an objective method of setting quotas.
    At the ICO talks major consuming nations, led by the U.S.,
proposed that future coffee export quota shares be calculated
by a formula incorporating a producer's recent exportable
production and verified stocks, while large producers led by
Brazil proposed maintaining the traditional ad hoc division of
shares. The consumer position would have in effect reduced the
market share of Brazil, by far the world's largest producer.
    Rosenbaum said the administration would continue to support
legislation now before Congress which would allow the U.S.
customs service to monitor coffee imports, as a way to comply
with any future coffee quotas.
    He said the Reagan administration would be reviewing the
coffee policy situation following the collapse of the London
talks, but "nobody is proposing we change our position."
    However, other U.S. government officials involved in coffee
policy said they are bracing for a diplomatic and coffee market
offensive from producer countries, led by Brazil and Colombia,
to soften the consumer position.
    "Knowing that its next crop is fairly large, Brazil will
kind of want to test the resolve of other producers and
consumers," said one U.S. official.
    The U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said
Brazil and Colombia may flood the coffee market in the next few
months in an effort to drive down prices and pressure other
countries, particularly the splinter group of small producers
who differed with the major producers in London.
    This in turn could lead to urgent appeals from Latin
American countries, faced with mounting debt problems, to the
U.S. State department, and to the National Security Council in
the White House, for an easing of the U.S. position, U.S.
officials said.
    The State department, a major player in setting U.S. coffee
policy, may then face conflicting pressures, particularly from
politically-sensitive U.S. allies in Central America, U.S.
officials said.
    El Salvador and Guatemala both backed Brazil and Colombia
at the London talks in resisting pressures for quotas based on
objective criteria. But the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica
joined the splinter group, which said it would agree to
objective criteria.
    There is a strong feeling among some in the State
Department that the United States should continue to support
the splinter group of producers who have taken the
politically-risky step of opposing Brazil on the objective
criteria question, U.S. officials said.
    Within the consuming countries there also is expected to be
some pressure to reassess positions.
    In London, the U.S. was supported by the U.K., the
Netherlands, West Germany, Japan, Australia and New Zealand on
the issue of objective criteria, U.S. officials said.
    This bloc represented enough votes among consuming nations
to successfully prevent adoption of the producer proposals.
    However, U.S. sources said West Germany's support was at
times qualified and there is some concern that the European
Community could come under pressure to be more accommodative to
producers in future talks. France backed the Ivory Coast and
other African producers during the talks.
    A softening of the EC stance would make it more difficult,
although not impossible, for the U.S. to block producer plans.
    While political manuevering by small producers and
consuming countries will be important, U.S. officials said the
key to any future outcome will be Brazil's position.
    U.S. officials blamed Brazil's intransigence for the
failure of the talks and said a more flexible position from
Brasilia would be the most important step toward agreement.

shares of Exovir Inc, or 12.9 pct of the total outstanding.

"invited" to become a member of the company's board.

<TITLE>TORRENTIAL RAINS HALT ARGENTINE GRAIN HARVEST</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Manuel Villanueva, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BUENOS AIRES, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Torrential rains throughout
Argentina's grain-producing areas virtually paralysed coarse
grain harvesting in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.
    Sunflower, maize and sorghum harvests were particularly
affected, they said. But the rains proved to be a great aid to
soybean crops as their harvesting will not begin until April or
May.
    The rains did no damage to maize, sunflower and sorghum
crops though fresh rains in similar volume could reduce yields
and cut the total volume of this year's harvest.
    Rainfall measured between 15 and 270 mm in Buenos Aires,
with the heaviest rains in the province's western sectors,
between 15 and 100 mm in Cordoba, 15 and 120 mm in La Pampa, 10
and 75 mm in Santa Fe, 10 and 60 mm in Entre Rios, five and 40
mm in Misiones, and five and 50 mm in San Luis.
    No rain was recorded in Corrientes, Chaco and Formosa.
    Growers did not revise their estimates for total volume of
the coarse grain harvest over last week's estimates.
    Maize harvesting continued moving forward in central Santa
Fe, though slowly. Growers had harvested seven to nine pct of
total planted area, compared to five to seven pct last week.
    Total maize area planted for the 1986/87 harvest was
estimated at between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares, or two to
seven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the
1985/86 harvest.
    Maize production is expected to total between 10.4 and 11
mln tonnes, or a drop of 17.5 to 19.4 pct over the 12.4 to 12.6
mln tonnes harvested last year according to private estimates,
or 18.9 to 21.9 pct lower than last year's volume, according to
official figures.
    The sunflower harvest advanced to between seven and nine
pct of total planted area.
    Two to 2.2 mln hectares have been planted with sunflowers
for this harvest, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct from last year's figure
of 3.14 mln hectares.
    Sunflower production is expected to total between 2.4 mln
and 2.7 mln tonnes, which would mean a drop of between 34.1 and
41.5 pct against the record 4.1 mln tonnes harvested in the
1985/86 harvest.
    Grain sorghum harvesting inched forward to between two and
four pct of total planted area, which this harvest is 1.23 to
1.30 mln hectares or 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mln
hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.
    Sorghum production is expected to total between 3.2 mln and
3.5 mln tonnes, or 16.7 to 22 pct less than the 4.1 to 4.2
million tonnes harvested in 1985/86.
    Soybean production, by contrast, is expected to hit a
record 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes, which would mean an increase of
11.1 to 15.1 pct over last year's record figure of 7.2 to 7.3
mln tonnes, according to private estimates. Official figures
put last year's soybean harvest at 7.1 mln tonnes.
    Soybean crops were reported to be in generally very good
condition, helped by abundant rains and high temperatures.
    Total soybean-planted area for the 1986/87 harvest is
expected to be a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares, up 10.8 to
13.8 pct from last year's harvest figure of 3.34 mln hectares.

<TITLE>U.S. SENATOR TO PROPOSE 0/92 FOR 1987 CROPS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., said he
intended to offer legislation that would allow 1987 producers
of wheat, feedgrains, cotton and rice to receive at least 92
pct of their deficiency payments, regardless of how much they
planted.
    Boschwitz told the Senate Agriculture Committee that
applying the so-called 0/92 provision to 1987 crops was
supported by the Reagan administration and would save
approximately 500 mln dlrs, including 266 mln dlrs in corn
payments, 90 mln dlrs in wheat and 30 mln dlrs in cotton.
    The Minnesota senator said he might offer the bill on the
Senate floor or in a conference committee with the House of
Representatives in the event a similar bill before the House
Agriculture Committee is approved by that body.
    Boschwitz told Reuters that neither he nor the U.S.
Agriculture Department had decided whether or how deficiency
payments should be guaranteed to farmers who might choose not
to plant under the decoupling scheme.
    If payments are not set in advance under decoupling, market
prices conceivably could rise, thereby leading to diminished
deficiency payments.
    Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,
said he wanted to go to conference with the House as soon as
possible on the issue, but would have to study the matter
further before deciding how he would vote on it.

<DATELINE>    BERNE, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro
met his Swiss counterpart Otto Stich, Swiss Economics Minister
Jean-Pascal Delamuraz and National Bank President Pierre
Languetin on the fourth leg of a tour to discuss his country's
debt problems.
    Funaro told reporters his trip, which has already taken him
to London, Paris and Bonn, was aimed at explaining his
country's stance to governments. Talks with commercial banks
will take place at a later date.
    Funaro said a mechanism would have to be found to end
Brazil's debt crisis but it would not be easy.
    Brazil would not repeat the measures it took in response to
its debt crisis of 1982, which he said had provoked the biggest
recession in his country's history, he added.
    He said European and Japanese banks were showing a more
flexible attitude towards Brazil's problems than U.S. Banks and
it was difficult to discuss capitalisation with the latter.
    A Swiss official said the Brazilian delegation had made no
demands.
    Funaro, who travels to Italy this evening, said it was
unclear if he would go to Japan on Friday or return to Brazil
first.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>TURKEY SEES 1.5 BILLION DLR DEFICIT IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ANKARA, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Turkey expects a 1986 balance of payments
deficit of 1.5 billion dlrs, well over target, but is taking
steps to improve its performance in this and other fields, Ali
Tigrel, director of economic planning at the State Planning
Organisation said.
    He told Reuters the shortfall was a direct consequence of
economic growth of nearly eight pct, up from 5.1 pct in 1985,
which he said resulted mostly from a surge in domestic demand.
    Tigrel acknowledged a need to cut inflation further after a
drop of more than 12 points to 24.6 pct in the Treasury
wholesale index last year.
    This year's target of 20 pct "might be attainable but the
economic management will have to be careful," he said.
    Tigrel, whose department produces the annual programme
which is central to the government's economic planning, said
Turkey's creditworthiness was at risk over the current account
shortfall, originally targeted at 695 mln dlrs.
    "We must alleviate the current account substantially to
sustain the creditworthiness that we have managed to secure
over the last five years," he added.
    His comment echoed last October's Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development report on Turkey, which said
Ankara's case for more medium-term financing on better terms
would look better if inflation were lower and the current
account deficit cut or turned into a surplus.
    "In 1987 we must reduce the rate of growth in public sector
investments, we must reduce the public sector deficit as a
percentage of GNP and we must achieve a very visible
improvement in the current account deficit," he said.
    Tigrel said a surge in public sector spending last year was
also to blame for the high deficits.
    Appropriations to government departments had been cut by
eight pct since the budget was passed in December and foreign
borrowing by municipalities had been restrained.
    "We are trying make sure that public bodies stick to the
investment programme and do not exceed their appropriations," he
said. It was hoped to bring the public sector borrowing
requirement down to five pct of GNP in 1987 from an estimated
5.6 pct in 1986.
    More modest GNP growth of five pct for 1987 was also
targeted, Tigrel said. Measures were being taken to encourage
exports, and production incentives were being considered.
    "We must try to make sure that more capacity is injected
into the Turkish economy in the coming years. The promotion
policy is geared to make sure that both foreign investment and
local private capital come more into play as far as
manufacturing capacity is concerned," Tigrel said.
    He said the process of structural adjustment of the Turkish
economy to free market policies, begun in 1980, was still under
way. Trade had been liberalised and a freer exchange rate
policy applied, but he acknowledged there was more to be done
in a country where the state still dominates industry and the
currency is only partially convertible.

<TITLE>ENERGY/CALIFORNIA OIL PRODUCTION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    BY MICHAEL FITZPATRICK, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Drilling for oil in California is
likely to continue at last year's sharply reduced levels
despite recent gains in crude oil prices, industry analysts
said.
    Because much of the crude oil in California fields is
thick, heavy and expensive to extract, oil prices would have to
increase to near 1985's levels before any significant recovery
is seen in drilling, they said.
    "Companies will probably only drill their best prospects,"
said John Curti, an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc.
    Few new wells now are being drilled.
    Only 33 rigs, about one-quarter of the total available,
were drilling for oil onshore in California last week, compared
to about 70 last year, said Bill Bolster of Munger Oil
Information Services, which tracks California drilling
activity.
    "It's in the dregs right now," said Bolster of the state's
drilling activity.
    Current prices are not enough to justify increased
drilling, said Ed Malmgreen of the California Independent
Producers Association.
    While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pact
to curb production boosted oil prices early this year, prices
eventually fell.
    Prices for California's marker grade, Line 63 blend, have
slumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a high
of about 17 dlrs.
    More than half of California's oil comes from stripper
wells, those producing less than 10 barrels a day, and that
much of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel to
extract, Malmgreen said.
    "It's not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs,"
Malmgreen said.
    Many stripper wells along the southern California coast
produce eight times as much water as crude oil, and inland
wells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur
extraction of the thick, heavy oil, he said.
    The outlook for future production in California is clouded
by a lack of exploratory drilling now, analysts said.
    In the heart of California's oil patch, Kern County, which
produces about two-thirds of the state's oil, exploratory
drilling has slowed to a crawl.
    Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in
1986, compared to 137 in 1985, according to David Mitchell of
the state energy commission. So far this year only five
exploratory wells have been drilled.
    "I don't think they'll even get to what they did last
year," Mitchell said.
    No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of
the decade, Mitchell said.
    Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in the
number of producing wells and overall production.
    Between February and October of 1986, the number of
producing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43,521 from
more than 50,000, said Bill Guerard of the California Energy
Commission.
    In line with that decrease, California's crude oil output
fell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and is
expected to remain at that lower level, analysts said.
    Between February and October 1986, California's crude oil
production slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrels
per day to 1.066 mln bpd, Guerard said.
    Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986
was 408 mln bbls, compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405
mln bbl in 1983, according to the California Department of
Conservation.
    "Production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels,"
Guerard said.

<TITLE>IZVESTIA SAYS SOVIET WINTER CROPS NEED RESEEDING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MOSCOW, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The government daily Izvestia said a
considerable amount of Soviet winter crops need to be reseeded
and the state 1987 grain harvest target of 232 mln tonnes will
not be easy to fulfil.
    Without giving figures, the newspaper said: "A considerable
part of the winter crops must be reseeded, but that creates
extra effort in the fields in spring."
    The Soviet Union has previously said nine mln hectares of
winter grain will have to be reseeded because of winterkill.
    A U.S. Department of Agriculture analyst in Washington has
said the figure of nine mln hectares would equal about 25 pct
of the total winter crop and would be the second highest
winterkill in 10 years.
    "The planned task of bringing in no less than 232 mln tonnes
of grain is not simple," Izvestia said.
    This week's sudden fall in temperatures has affected large
parts of the country and has caused fieldwork to stop in the
Ukraine, it said, adding that temperatures fell to as low as
minus 30 centigrade in Byelorussia.

<TITLE>ARGENTINA'S CREDITORS SAID DIVIDED OVER DEBT ISSUE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BUENOS AIRES, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Central Bank director Daniel Marx
said Argentina's creditor banks were divided on the country's
request for rescheduling its foreign debt.
    "There are difficulties (among the banks) to reach an
agreement and find a unanimous decision," Marx told a local
radio station in a telephone interview from New York.
    Argentina's great efforts to comply with obligations on its
50 billion dlr foreign debt should be met by a reduction in
interest rates on the part of the creditor banks, he said.
    Marx is in New York with Argentina's debt negotiating team
holding talks with the creditor banks' steering committee.
    Marx said the talks should not drag on. "If Venezuela and
Mexico have concluded their negotiations, we want to end (ours)
in a reasonable manner and as soon as possible," he said.
    Economy ministry sources said the steering committee was
expected today to make a counter-proposal not unlike that made
by Treasury Secretary Mario Brodersohn at the start of the
talks between the two parties.
    Argentina is seeking a 2.15 billion dlr loan to meet four
pct growth targets in 1987. It also wants lower interest rates
on its foreign debt. The United States said last week it would
support a 500 mln dlr bridging loan for Argentina.

<TITLE>U.S. SENATE PANEL MAKES CONSERVATION EXEMPTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee
approved a measure that would exempt farmers who planted
alfalfa or other multiyear grasses and legumes between 1981 and
1985 from a federal conservation requirement.
    Sen. Edward Zorinsky, D-Neb., said his bill would restore
equity under federal sodbuster rules, which currently deny farm
program benefits to farmers who, between 1981 and 1985, planted
alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes without
interrupting the plantings with a row crop.
    An official from a leading conservation group, who asked
not to be identified, said the panel's move was "an unfortunate
first action" because it could lead to the exemption of
potentially millions of acres from the sod buster regulations,
established under the 1985 farm bill.

<TITLE>OUTBOARD MARINE &lt;OM> RISING ON TAKEOVER RUMOR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Wall Street traders said the stock of
Outboard Marine Corp was rising on a rumor over a cable
television program that Outboard is a likely takeover target of
Sun Chemical Corp &lt;SNL>.
    Outboard was up 3-1/8 to 34-5/8. On Tuesday it rose 1-3/8
to 31-1/2 Tuesday.
    A report on Cable News Network today said Sun Chemical has
4.9 pct of Outboard and is conducting a study on whether to go
for control of the whole company.
    An Outboard Marine spokesman would not comment on the
rumor.
    The cable program said a buyout of Outboard would be for up
to 40 dlrs a share, or for a total of 680 mln dlrs.
    A spokesman for Sun Chemical was not immediately available.
    Outboard Marine last June adopted a shareholder rights plan
that will be triggered when a person or group acquires
beneficial ownership of 20 pct or more of its common or begins
a tender offer that would result in 30 pct ownership.
    Wayne Jones, vice president at Outboard for strategic
planning, said management wants to stay independent. "We are
not trying to sell the company. We are proceeding with our
strategic plans," he said.
    That plan includes integrating five boat companies that
Outboard Marine has bought since the middle of December. Jones
said all five will cost between 100 mln dlrs to 120 mln dlrs.
    An analyst who wanted anonymity said 40 dlrs a share is a
"decent" price for outboard. "A bdding war to 50 or 60 dlrs a
share is stretching it. Maybe 45 dlrs a share tops," he said.
    Outboard, which has 17 mln shares outstanding, is in
registration for a two mln common share offering with Morgan
Stanley Inc. It makes sense, the analyst said, for Sun Chemical
to strike before the offering is underway.

<TITLE>FRENCH WHEAT EXPORTS TO EC FALL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>French soft wheat exports to other
European Community countries fell 18 pct to 4.13 mln tonnes in
the first seven months of the 1986/87 season to January
compared with 5.04 mln in the same 1985/86 period, the French
Cereals Intervention Office (ONIC) said.
    According to latest ONIC statistics, the main buyers were
Italy with 1.89 mln against 1.63 mln in the same 1985/86
period, West Germany 480,450 tonnes against 717,689, the
Netherlands 462,048 (532,299) and Belgium 417,887 tonnes
(919,337).
    British and Greek imports of French soft wheat during this
period were below year-ago levels. Between July 1 last year and
January 31, Britain bought 274,665 tonnes against 642,800
tonnes, ONIC figures showed.
    But Spanish purchases were up sharply at 258,507 tonnes
against 2,751 tonnes in the same 1985/86 period and Portugal
bought 37,599 tonnes compared with zero.
    ONIC said the drop in French exports to other Community
countries was due to British competition.

<TITLE>ESTIMATED FRENCH BARLEY STOCKS WORRYING - ONIC</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The size of French 1986/87 carryover
barley stocks, estimated at 1.72 mln tonnes compared with
700,000 tonnes in 1985/86 is worrying, French Cereals
Intervention Office (ONIC) Director Bernard Vieux said.
    He told journalists these estimates were unchanged at the
end of February from the previous month while export forecasts
were lowered to 4.5 mln tonnes from 5.76 mln in 1985/86.
    Vieux called on the EC Commission to help by awarding a
larger volume of export certificates and said if no outlets are
opened for French barley a large amount could be put into
intervention.
    A small amount of French barley has already been put into
intervention, Vieux said without detailing the amount.
    The outlook for French maize is better with 1986/87 exports
to non-EC countries now put at 700,000 tonnes against 200,000
tonnes at the end of January and against 155,000 tonnes in
1985/86.
    The higher estimate is due to the EC Commission's decision
to hold special export tenders for French maize, he said.

<TITLE>S. KOREAN TRADE SURPLUS WITH U.S. SEEN FALLING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 4, - </DATELINE><BODY>South Korea's record 7.1 billion dlrs
trade surplus with the U.S. is bound to diminish as the
country switches purchases from Japan in favor of U.S.
companies, Trade Minister Woong-Bae Rha said.
     He rejected suggestions the Korean Won is undervalued, and
denied any plans for a "drastic and sudden" revaluation.
    Rha is heading a trade mission to 37 U.S. cities. Last year
South Korea ran a 4.3 billion dlr trade surplus, including a
record 7.1 billion surplus with the U.S. and a 5.5 billion dlr
deficit with Japan.
    Rha told Reuters in an interview the current trade mission
is looking for 2.0 billion dlrs in purchases from U.S.
companies, about a quarter of which represents "transferred
purchases from Japanese sources."
    Rha said the items being sought by the current mission are
"mainly chemicals, machinery and parts."
    He said South Korea is the fourth largest importer of U.S.
agricultural products. The current mission is not involved in
that area but there are plans to buy "substantial amounts of
cotton" from the U.S.
    He noted his country "is clearly not as open as the American
market. Nor is it reasonable to expect that it should be,"
considering South Korea has a 40 billion dlr foreign debt and
spends six pct of its gross national product on defense.

<TITLE>CANADA WHEAT BOARD ADVISES CUT IN GRAIN PRICES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WINNIPEG, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Canadian Wheat Board has advised
the federal government to sharply cut initial prices paid to
farmers for their wheat, oats, and barley in the crop year
beginning August 1, a board spokesman said.
    The spokesman declined to give the size of the recommended
price drops but said it would not be good news for western
Canadian grain growers.
    "They're all lower," he said. "This is really getting
pretty serious. We're talking nuts and bolts economic survival
and whether it's worthwhile for farmers to put in a crop."
    Farm leaders and economists have estimated the board will
recommend cuts of around 20 pct in the initial prices.
    Farmers receive the initial payment when the grain is
delivered to the elevators used by the wheat board.
    If the wheat board, which markets most of Canada's grain,
obtains higher than expected prices on world markets, the
farmers receive a final payment at the end of the crop year. If
prices are lower, the federal treasury makes up the difference.
    The final decision on the initial prices, usually made in
April, rests with Wheat Board Minister Charles Mayer and the
federal cabinet.
    Last year Mayer cut the initial prices between 19 and 27
pct but last fall the government announced a one billion
Canadian dlr aid program to compensate for the price cuts.
    But federal agricultural officials have already warned
farmers not to depend on additional government aid this year.

<DATELINE>    GENEVA, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The ruling GATT Council deferred a
decision on whether to set up a dispute panel on the basis of a
European Community complaint against the U.S.- Japanese
agreement on exports of computer semiconductors.
    David Woods, spokesman of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT), told a news briefing that the main parties
would continue bilateral talks. This was in the hope of
resolving the row before the next Council meeting on April 15.
    The five-year accord signed in July 1986 aims to protect
the U.S. Market from dumping of low-price Japanese microchips,
officially known as semiconductors.
    The E.C. Complained the accord breached GATT trade rules by
allowing Tokyo to monitor prices, allowing it to set minimum
prices for Japanese chips sold in third countries.
    The 12-nation Community also charged the agreement gave
U.S. Producers preferential access to the Japanese market.
    Woods said many nations -- Hong Kong, Canada, Switzerland,
Singapore, Sweden, Malaysia and Nigeria -- had supported the EC
complaint during the heated Council debate.
    Japan's delegate, Minoru Endo, and U.S. Ambassador Michael
Samuels replied in the debate that the E.C. Charges were
unfounded, but they were willing to continue bilateral talks.

<TITLE>TALKING POINT/GENERAL MOTORS &lt;GM></TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Steven Radwell, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>General Motors Corp staged an explosive
rally on Wall Street after a share buyback program announced
yesterday, but analysts said GM's future remains clouded by
stiff competition and erosion of market share.
    GM shares rose 3-1/2 to 79-1/8 in active trading. Analysts
agreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they 
differed sharply over the carmaker's long term prospects.
    "I'm very positive on GM," said Jack Kirnan of Kidder
Peabody and Co. "They're clearly committed to enhancing
shareholder value."
    However, some analysts worry about how GM will pay for the
buyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to
recapture lost market share.
    After the market had closed yesterday, GM said it would buy
back 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990. The
announcement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares,
with more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day.
    The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the
stock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning, and at
least one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on a
good performance expected from new car models.
    But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said the
repurchase program is not a positive.
    "The buyback doesn't really change the earnings outlook and
puts more stress on the balance sheet," he said, since GM will
have to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases. The stock
should settle back down to around 76, he added.
    Healy projects GM will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and
5.50 dlrs in 1988, compared to 1986 earnings of 8.21 dlrs.
Healy's numbers are near the low end of Wall Street estimates,
which range from five dlrs to 7.80 dlrs in 1987 and from four
dlrs to 10.80 dlrs in 1988.
    Like other analysts, Healy sees GM's share of the domestic
car and truck market falling in 1987. "On balance, GM cars are
not selling as well as their competitors," he said.
    In late February, GM car sales fell 8.6 pct from the
year-ago period while competitors Ford Motor Co &lt;F> and
Chrysler Corp &lt;C> both posted increases. But GM said February
sales showed improvement over January, adding that it expects
improvement in coming months.
    Overall, GM's share of U.S. car and truck sales should fall
to around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986,
analysts said. The numbers include imports.
    Kidder Peabody's Kirnan said cost reductions and product
improvements this year should lead to positive cash flow by the
fourth quarter, which will help GM finance the buyback.
    "GM (stock) has been a real laggard and now it's rolling up
its sleeves and getting serious. I think there's a major
earnings surprise in the winds," he said.
    Kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today, in
part in reaction to the announced buyback, and sees GM earning
5.65 dlrs this year and 9.75 dlrs in 1988. "The company is more
concerned than ever about improving their relative valuation
with respect to Ford and Chrysler," he said.
    Another positive for the stock is GM's dividend, currently
five dlrs a share annually, which gives it a higher yield than
its competitors, Kirnan said. And GM will raise the cash
dividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year, he predicted.
    But analyst Michael Lucky of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc
said U.S. car sales will weaken, and GM's new products, if
successful, will only slow but not halt the erosion of its
market share.
    "I believe their new cars will be successful, but that will
only curtail losses in market share," which will fall to around
35 pct by 1990, Lucky said.
    Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs and Co falls in the middle
of the bulls and bears. While he is recommending GM stock, he
said results will not improve until 1988.
    "I'm not looking for improvement this year. This is a
transition year for GM," he said.
    Fricke, who estimates 1987 earnings at 7.80 dlrs and 1988
at 10.80 dlrs, said cost cutting and new car models will not
affect 1987 results. "But the key thing isn't so much what they
earn this year. It's the momentum beyond this year that's
important."

<TITLE>U.K. OIL INDUSTRY SAID NOT PERMANENTLY DAMAGED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.K. Offshore oil industry has
suffered from last year's collapse in oil prices but should not
sustain any permament damage, Minister of State for Energy
Alick Buchanan-Smith said.
    The drilling, diving and supply vessels sectors had been
most affected, Buchanan Snith told the House of Commons energy
committee. He noted, however, that oil companies were still
spending six mln stg a day to maintain North Sea production.
    He added that a report by the manpower services committee
which said 14,000 jobs were lost in the industry in 1986 should
be seen in the context of a total workforce of 300,000.
    Prices of North Sea Brent-grade crude dipped to a low of
8.50
dlrs a barrel last July from a peak of over 30 dlrs the
previous November.
    They recovered to around 18 dlrs a barrel after last
December's OPEC meeting and Brent traded today around 17.15
dlrs.
    Buchanan-Smith said the U.K. Has no intention of adopting
OPEC style quotas, noting that Britian is an oil-consuming as
well as an oil-producing nation.

<TITLE>TOTAL STILL EXPECTS 1.5 BILLION FRANC 1986 LOSS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>French oil group Total Cie Francaise des
Petroles &lt;TPN.PA> is still expecting a 1.5 billion franc
consolidated net loss, including minority interests, for 1986,
after taking account of stock losses of 7.5 billion francs, the
company said in a communique after a board meeting here.
    In late January group president Francois-Xavier Ortoli told
journalists that the slump in oil prices and the weak dollar
had caused the stock depreciation, turning a consolidated net
profit, before losses on stocks, of six billion francs into a
consolidated net loss of 1.5 billion francs.
    Earlier today Armand Guilbaud, president of Total's
refining and distribution subsidiary Cie de
Raffinage-Distribution (CRD) Total France &lt;RAFF.PA>, told
journalists that 1986 had marked a return to profit for the
subsidiary before stock depreciation.
    CRD made a net profit before stock depreciation and
currency factors of 1.95 billion francs last year after a 1.16
billion loss in 1985.
    But its net loss last year, taking account of that
depreciation as well as currency fluctuations, was 1.16 billion
francs after a 1.05 billion loss in 1985.
    In 1986 CRD's sales fell 5.7 pct to 19.7 mln tonnes from
20.9 mln "due to the growth in imports by independent
distributors following a relaxation of regulations," Guilbaud
said.
    The subsidiary is expecting to cut its workforce to 6,000
this year and 5,000 in 1988 from 6,800 last year, under a job
reduction scheme which will eventually save the group 600 mln
francs, he said.
    Concerning business in 1987, he said that "January was a
good month, but the situation deteriorated in February."

<TITLE>TEXAS OIL REGULATOR CALLS FOR STATE TAX BREAKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AUSTIN, Texas, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Texas Railroad Commissioner James
Nugent, saying that the ailing oilpatch cannot wait for
Congress to act, today urged Texas state lawmakers to adopt
incentives to find new oil reserves and to exempt severance
taxes on oil produced from stripper wells.
    Nugent said in a speech to the Texas house of
representatives that the state must take the initiative in
molding U.S. energy policy and finding new ways to assist
troubled oil producers.
    His proposal to revitalize Texas' oil industry would exempt
stripper wells that produce 10 barrels of oil or less each day
from the state's 4.6 pct severance tax. He said that the
majority of Texas' oil wells fall within the stripper well
category and a price swing of two to three dlrs a barrel can be
crucial in determining if the well remains in production.
    Nugent also called for state lawmakers to exempt new
wildcat wells from the state severance tax for up to five years
as a financial incentive to explore for new oil reserves.
    Secondary and tertiary oil production, expensive methods of
production that inject water or gas into the ground to recover
oil, should also be exempted from the severance tax, Nugent
said. His plan would exempt existing secondary and tertiary
wells that produce at a rate of less than three barrels a day
for three years, or until the price of oil reaches $25 a
barrel.
    "We've been sitting back and waiting on two federal
administrations to develop a coherent energy policy for the
nation to follow. I say we have waited long enough," Nugent
said. "In other words, let's tell Washington to either lead,
follow, or get out of the way."
    Nugent said that the financial losses to the state treasury
by exempting marginal oil production from state severance taxes
would be more than made up by stimulating new business for the
oil supply and service industry.

<TITLE>COLOMBIA BLASTS U.S. FOR COFFEE TALKS FAILURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOGOTA, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Colombian finance minister Cesar Gaviria
blamed an inflexible U.S. position for the failure of last
week's International Coffee Organisation, ICO, talks on export
quotas.
    "We understand that the U.S. Position was more inflexible
than the one of Brazil, where current economic and political
factors make it difficult to adopt certain positions," Gaviria
told Reuters in an interview.
    The U.S. and Brazil have each laid the blame on the other
for the breakdown in the negotiations to re-introduce export
quotas after being extended through the weekend in London.
    Gaviria stressed that Colombia tried to ensure a successful
outcome of the London talks but he deplored that intransigent
attitudes, both from producing and consuming nations, made it
impossible.
    In a conversation later with local journalists, Gaviria
said the U.S. attitude would have serious economic and
political consequences, not necessarily for a country like
Colombia but certainly for other Latin American nations and for
some African countries.
    He told Reuters that Colombia, because of the relatively
high level of its coffee stocks, would probably suffer less.
    According to Gaviria, Colombia can hope to earn about 1,500
mln dlrs this calendar year from coffee exports, which
traditionally account for 55 pct of the country's total export
revenue.
    That estimate would represent a drop in revenues of 1,400
mln dlrs from 1986.
    Colombia, which held stockpiles of 10.5 mln bags at the
start of the current coffee year, exported a record 11.5 mln
bags in the 1985/86 coffee year ending last September 30.

<TITLE>PACTEL &lt;PAC> SEES EARNINGS GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, march 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pacific Telesis Group chairman Donald
Guinn told a meeting of security analysts that the company sees
continued earnings growth in 1987 above the 1.08 billion dlrs,
or 5.02 dlrs per share, earned in 1986.
    Guinn also said that capital spending stood at about 1.8
billion dlrs in 1986, and the company expected the figure to
remain flat each year through 1989. He noted that all captial
spending will be internally financed.
    Guinn also told analysts that the company faced some
regulatory uncertainties in ongoing rate cases at its Pacific
Bell operating company.
    In rates hearings before, the California Public Utility
Commission, Guinn said the company faced a potential 76 mln dlr
revenue reduction, and due to ongoing discussions with the
commission, he said the figure might even be greater.
    The company also faces some opposition to a 225 mln dlr
rate hike requested for 1986. Guinn said the commission found
180 mln dlrs of the hike was based on questionable calculations
and assumptions, while 45 mln dlrs might represented unneeded
modernization costs.
    Guinn also said that the company is still studying whether
to join an international consortium that plans to lay a
transpacific telephone cable between the U.S. and Japan.
    "We have not agreed to anything," Guinn said, but added he
would soon recieve a feasibility study on the venture and the
company would make a decision soon on participating.
    Asked by an analyst about the recent recommendation by the
U.S. Department of Justice which would allow the Bell operating
companies to offer limited long distance services, Guinn said
the company would likely shy away from that type of expansion.
    "(Long distance services) is a very competitive business.
It's a commodity business and becoming more so," he said. "I'm
not so sure we would be interested in getting back into that
business."
    However, Guinn generally applauded the U.S.
recommendations, saying they would give more latitude for the
Bell operating companies to expand into non-regulated
businesses and provide more flexibility to form strategic
alliances with other companies.
    He added that while the company welcomes the expansion into
new areas, it is not currently involved in any acqusition
talks. "We do not have anything actively under consideration,"
he said.

    The state-owned Kenya Ports Authority, KPA, signed an

with an initial capital of 100 mln shillings, sources said. KPA
will hold 70 pct of the shares in the new company.
    The line will initially charter vessels to operate services
between Mombasa and the main ports of industrial Europe, but
may eventually build or buy its own ships. The sources said it
would aim to carry a large part of Kenya's coffee and tea
exports and oil and fertiliser imports.

<TITLE>NEW BANK RULES TOUGHER THAN NEEDED, DEALERS SAY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Norma Cohen, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. and U.K. bank regulators are asking
banks to set aside more reserves than is necessary to cushion
them against the risks posed by the interest rate and currency
swap transactions they carry, swap dealers said.
    After viewing proposed guidelines released jointly today by
the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Board, dealers said
that in effect, regulators are asking them to set aside
reserves twice for the same risk.
    Market participants will have 60 days to respond to the
proposals.
    Adoption of stiffer capital requirements is especially
significant in the eurobond markets, which saw new issue volume
of about 183 billion dlrs in 1986 according to figures compiled
by Euromoney magazine. While no firm figures exist, dealers in
eurobonds estimate that 80 pct of all new issues are involved
in some swap arrangement. Separately, the ISDA estimates that
about 300 billion dlrs worth of swap transactions are
outstanding. Kenneth McCormick, co-chairman of the
International Swap Dealers Association (ISDA) and President of
Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc, said that the Association
has no comment and will study the proposals.
    "What they are proposing is really double counting," Patrick
de Saint-Aignan, managing director of swaps for Morgan Stanley
and Co, said. Instead, he argues, banks should either be
required to hold a percentage of the face value -- say one pct
per year to maturity -- or to hold a percentage of the cost of
replacing the contract in the event of a counterparty default.
    "The potential risk factors are very large relative to what
we had expected," said a director at one U.K. merchant bank.
"What they are really doing is asking you to capitalize now --
to borrow money now -- to cushion you against risk you might
have 10 years from now," he added.(Adds title first paragraph).
    Dealers also said they believe that banks not covered by
the agreement, such as those based in Japan, will have a
competitive advantage because they will not have to pass the
costs on to customers.
    Indeed, regulators are apparently also concerned about the
exclusion of other countries from the new requirements. Federal
Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger, following approval of the
proposed guidelines by the Fed, said she is concerned that
Japan was not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new
capital rules.
     Dealers said they were somewhat relieved to see that bank
regulators recognized the concept of netting, that is,
offsetting the amounts receiveable from and payable to a single
counterparty against each other.
    The paper said that regulatory authorities "recognize that
such arrangements (netting) may in certain circumstances reduce
credit risk." Furthermore, the paper said, if a netting
agreement could be reached that would withstand legal tests, it
might be willing to reduce capital requirements accordingly.
    But dealers said they fear regulators may insist on an
airtight netting agreement that is impossible to design.
     "One problem is that there has never been a major default
in the swaps market. So we don't know if any of the swap
arrangements will really stand up in court," said one bank
official.

<TITLE>BANK OF CANADA MADE AGGRESSIVE USE OF T-BILLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Canadian government's reduced
borrowing needs enabled the Bank of Canada to make "aggressive
use" of short term debt instruments and pare the cost of
financing in 1986, the central bank said in its annual report.
    The report, authored by retired governor Gerald Bouey, also
noted advances to Canadian banks fell to under one billion dlrs
at the end of the year from more than four billion dlrs in
January, 1986, and that the country's economy performed
unevenly while inflation remained a major concern.
    Bouey said the bank was able to reduce the number of new
bond issues with maturities of 10 years of more, lessen the
reliance on Canada Savings Bonds while raising substantailly
more through short term treasury bill financings.
    "The aggressive use of the treasury bill program has meant
that the government is now able to maintain lower cash balances
and lower financing costs," said Bouey who was replaced by
deputy governor John Crow last month.
    The amount of treasury bills outstanding at year end was
69.7 billion dlrs, an increase of 10.3 billion dlrs over the
year and 20 billion dlrs since 1984.
    The reduction in borrrowing needs was brought about by an
eight billion dlr decline in the government's financing
requirements, a run down in Ottawa's cash balances, and
generation of 2.3 billion dlrs from foreign exchange
transactions.
    Also in pursuit of shorter term financing, the bank made
greater use of bond auctions to market new issues with two to
five year maturities, Bouey said.
    Bouey said payments to chartered banks, which are made to
banks that are facing liquidity problems, dropped to an average
of 832.3 mln dlrs at end of December from a peak of 5.2 billion
dlrs in March, 1986.
    The advances were made largely to four banks, Canadian
Commercial Bank, Northland Bank, Continental Bank of Canada and
the Bank of British Columbia. The first two banks have been
liquidated, which enabled partial repayment of advances, and
the remaining two banks were sold and the new owners repaid the
advances.

<TITLE>DYNAMICS CORP &lt;DYA> IN SETTLEMENT WITH CTS &lt;CTS></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GREENWICH, Conn., March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dynamics Corp of America said
it has reached an agreement with CTS Corp resolving all
differences between the two companies.
    It said as a result of the settlement, CTS's special board
committee has stopped soliciting orders to purchase some or all
of CTS.
    Dynamics, which now owns 27.5 pct of CTS' outstanding
stock, said it agreed to limit its shareholdings to not more
than 35 pct of the outstanding shares for a year following the
company's 1987 annual meeting.
    Dynamics said the CTS board will recommend CTS shareholders
vote at the 1987 annual meeting in favor of the company paying
Dynamics 2,178,000 dlrs as a reimbursement for its CTS releated
costs and granting Dynamics an option to buy enough CTS common
at 29.625 dlrs a share to give it ownership of 35 pct of the
outstanding stock.
    Dynamics said the price of stock under the option,
exercisable for one year, is based on the average closing price
for the stock for the five days ending March two.
    Dynamics said CTS Chairman George F. Sommer will assume the
additional title of President. Former President Robert D.
Hostetler is resigning as a director, as is Chief Financial
Officer Gary B. Erekson, Ted Ross and Donald J. Kacek.
    Dynamics said the CTS board will be reduced to seven
members for eight with the remaining four members of the
current board and three representatives of Dynamics as new
directors.

<TITLE>RENEWAL OF U.S./USSR GRAIN PACT SAID UNCERTAIN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Prospects for renewal of the
five-year U.S./USSR grains agreement are uncertain at this
point, a Soviet trade official told Reuters.
    The current trade imbalance between the United States and
the Soviet Union, high U.S. commodity prices, and increased
world grain production make a renewal of the supply agreement
next year less certain, Albert Melnikov, deputy trade
representative of the Soviet Union, said in an interview.
    The current agreement expires on Sept 30, 1988.
    Melnikov said that world grain markets are different than
when the first agreement was signed in 1975.
    Statements from both U.S. and Soviet officials have
indicate that a long term grains agreement might not be as
attractive for both sides as it once was.
    "We have had one agreement. We have had a second agreement,
but with the second agreement we've had difficulties with
prices," Melnikov said.
    "I cannot give you any forecasts in response to the future
about the agreement.... I do not want to speculate on what will
happen after Sept 30, 1988," he said.
    Melnikov noted that he has seen no indications from Soviet
government officials that they would be pushing for a renewal
of the agreement.
    "The situation is different in comparison to three, five or
ten years ago ... We can produce more," he said.

<TITLE>TWA &lt;TWA> MAKES MERGER OFFER FOR USAIR &lt;U></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Trans World Airlines said it has
proposed a cash merger of USAir Group with TWA in which the
holders of USAir common would receive 52 dlrs in cash in
exchange for their stock.
    TWA said the offer was made in a letter to Edmin Colodny,
chairman and president of USAir.
    TWA said, however, that if the negotiated deal is not
acceptable it may make an offer directly to USAir's
shareholders for up to 51 pct of USAir's outstanding stock, to
be purchased in a voting trust at a price lower than today's
offer.
    TWA said it is filing an application with the Department of
Transportation seeking approval of the merger as well as an
application for approval, on an expedited basis, of its
purchase of up to 51 pct of USAir common and the deposit of the
stock in a voting trust, pending DOT approval.
    TWA said that in respect to USAir's recent offer for
Piedmont Aviation &lt;PIE> it believes that USAir's shareholders
would prefer a cash merger proposal for USAir over its proposed
acquisition of Piedmont.
    TWA said, however, it also would be interested in
discussing a three way deal among USAir, Piedmont and TWA.
    TWA said the merger is subject to the USAir board redeeming
the preferred stock purchase rights (the poison pill) issued to
shareholders last year and taking action so that the vote of a
majority of the outstanding common stock is required to approve
its proposed move.
    Additionally, TWA said it would need a satisfactory due
diligence review of USAir.
    TWA said it has not yet had an opportunity to obtain the
necessary financing for the deal, but added it is confident
that it will get it.

said that it had increased its three-part bond issue to 1.8
billion schillings from the 1.5 billion orginally planned.
    GZB said in a statement that the amount being issued
between today and March 6 had been raised due to heavy demand.
    A 12-year tranche caries seven pct interest with an issue
price of 100.75 while an eight-year part, issued at 100.5,
carries a 6.75 pct. The third, 20-year tranche offers 6.5 pct
interest in the first year, but afterwards interest will be
fixed annually at the average of secondary market rates.

<DATELINE>    ELKHART, IND., March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>CTS Corp and Dynamics Corp of
America reached an agreement resolving all outstanding
differences between them, according to a joint statment.
    As a result of the settlement, a special committee of the
board of directors of CTS stopped soliciting offers to buy all
or part of the company, it said.
    CTS and DCA also agreed to dismiss all pending litigation
between the two companies except for one appeal pending before
the U.S. Supreme Court relating to the Indiana Control Share
Chapter, it said.
    Under the agreement, the CTS board will immediately be
reduced to seven from eight with four current directors and
three representatives of DCA being elected to the board, it
said. This board will be presented as the slate for CTS' 1987
annual shareholders meeting, it added.
    CTS' directors will recommend to shareholders that they
approve reimbursement to DCA of about 2.2 mln dlrs in expenses
relating to CTS, and grant DCA an option to buy up to 35 pct of
CTS' shares, it said.
    In addition, DCA said it agreed to limit its ownership in
CTS for the year following the 1987 annual meeting to not more
than 35 pct of the outstanding stock. DCA currently holds 27.5
pct of the outstanding shares of CTS.
    Both companies said they support the agreement and believe
it to be fair to both sides.

said.

on an offer it received from Trans World Airlines to buy USAir
for 52 dlrs cash per share.
    USAir spokesman David Shipley also declined comment on
Piedmont Aviation Inc &lt;PIE>. USAir has offered 71 dlrs cash per
share for half of Piedmont's stock, and 73 dlrs in its own
stock for the balance.
    Piedmont also received an offer from Norfolk Southern Corp
&lt;NSC> of 65 dlrs cash per share. Piedmont's board was meeting
today, but the company declined to say what was on the agenda.
A spokesman said he could not comment on the twa action.
    A Norfolk Southern Corp &lt;NSC> spokesman said the company
had no comment on TWA's offer for USAir or on its proposal to
negotiate a three-way merger between TWA, USAir and Piedmont.
    "We don't have all the details," a Norfolk Southern
spokesman said. The company's 65 dlr-a-share cash offer for
Piedmont stands, he said.
    In its offer, TWA said as an alternative to a merger with
USAir, it would be interested in discussing a three-way
combination among USAir, Piedmont and TWA. It said the
three-way merger would serve the best interests of the
shareholders of all three companies, employees and consumers.

<TITLE>MORE PRESSURE URGED FOR ASIA TO TAKE U.S. BEEF</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Congressmen from beef producing
states and representatives of the U.S. livestock industry 
urged the Reagan administration to press Japan and South Korea
to open up their markets to imports of beef.
    Testifying at a House subcommittee hearing on livestock
issues, Rep. Hal Daub (R-Nebr.), said the administration should
push hard for greater beef imports by Japan and South Korea.
Daub was joined by several other lawmakers.
    U.S. assistant trade representative Suzanne Earley, replied
"we're not going to let Japan off the hook, or Korea." She
noted trade representative Clayton Yeutter met with a senior
Korean official last week on the beef issue, and that Yeutter
and Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng will visit Tokyo in
April for discussions on farm trade issues.
    Japan maintains a quota on beef imports, set at 58,400
tonnes high quality beef in fiscal 1987. South Korea has banned
beef imports but there are indications Seoul may bow to U.S.
pressure and allow some imports soon, industry officials said.
    In testimony today, Tom Cook, director of industry affairs
for the National Cattlemens Association said "the Congress,
administration and the industry must take a strong, tough and
united stand to impress the Japanese that we mean business and
that we expect them to open their markets."

    De Kock, interviewed on state-run television, gave no

<TITLE>MORE SOVIET GRAIN BUYING FROM U.S. TIED TO PRICE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Whether the Soviet Union will fulfill
its buying obligations under the U.S./USSR grains agreement
depends entirely on the United States, a Soviet trade official
told Reuters.
    "How can I tell that we are ready to fulfill the agreement
if the United States does not want to offer us grain at
competitive prices?" said Albert Melnikov, deputy trade
representative of the Soviet Union to the United States.
    "We are in the market for grains, but it is up to the
United States to be the seller ... to offer Soviets competitive
prices," he said in an interview.
    Melnikov said that the United States has not lived up the
agreement by failing to make available to Moscow U.S. grain at
prevailing market prices.
    "We are being accused of not implementing this agreement.
We do not consider we are at fault," Melnikov said.
    Article I in the agreement states that "purchases/sales of
commodities under this Agreement will be made at the market
price prevailing for these products at the time of
purchase/sale and in accordance with normal commercial terms."
    "The United States should supply to the Soviet Union
definite quantities of grain at competitive prices ... Is the
United States ready to supply this?" he said.
    The Soviet official said that near-term corn demand has
been met by the recent Soviet purchases of U.S. corn, which he
confirmed at 1.5 mln tonnes, but said that if U.S. corn prices
remain competitive, the Soviets will buy more if they need it.
    Wheat buying, however, is a different story, Melnikov said.
    "If the United States is interested in selling its wheat,
then they must offer competitive prices, and it's up to the
United States to decide how these competitive prices will be
offered," he said.
    Last year's U.S. offer of subsidized wheat to the Soviets
was rejected because of an insufficient subsidy, Melnikov said.
He said that at the time of the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy offer,
U.S. wheat prices were 26 dlrs over world levels.

<TITLE>AMERICAN FARM BUREAU OPPOSES FARM BILL CHANGES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The directors of the American Farm
Bureau, the nation's largest farm organization, voted Tuesday
to urge Congress to leave the 1985 farm bill in place without
alterations.
    "We are solidly opposed to opening up the 1985 farm bill,"
said Dean Kleckner, president. "The current farm bill has been
in place for just a little over a year and in our judgment
there is more to be gained at the present time from maintaining
the legislation.
    "Several independent studies ... indicate the 1985 farm
bill is better on balance than any of the alternatives being
advanced," Kleckner said.
    The Farm Bureau also urged Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng to adjust the loan rate for 1987 crop soybeans as much as
he deems possible under the farm bill to keep soybeans
competitive in the world market.
    A Farm Bureau proposal suggests that producers should be
eligible for supplemental payments in the form of PIK
certificates for the difference between 5.02 dlrs a bushel and
the new loan rate.
    The organization also urged Lyng to authorize deficiency
payments to farmers who were unable to plant 1987 winter wheat
because of adverse weather.

<TITLE>VIACOM &lt;VIA> MERGER EXPECTED IN 60 TO 90 DAYS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sumner Redstone, president of National
Amusements, Inc, predicted he can win regulatory approvals to
wrap up the 3.4 billion dlr acquisition of Viacom International
Inc in 60 to 90 days.
    Redstone, 63, catapulted himself into the big leagues of
entertainment early today when a group of Viacom managers and
their financial backers decided not to top National's bid.
    "We've had counsel working for some time in every region
where Viacom has cable televison systems" Redstone told Reuters
in a telephone interview.
    Redstone also said "Viacom is committed to working very
closely with us to obtain approvals." Viacom has been seeking
approvals for transfer of its broadcast licenses and cable
systems since September when its management group first
advanced a buyout plan.
    But Redstone turned the situation into a spirited bidding
contest which was capped by the announcement this morning that
Viacom's independent directors on behalf of Viacom entered into
a defintive merger agreement with National.
    National is a family business which operates a chain of
movie theaters. It is dwarfed by Viacom.
    Redstone said he was weary after talks dragged on through
the night but also excited at the prospect of running a leading
electronic media company. He noted that the number of motion
picture admissions in the U.S. has shown no growth in 15 years.
    Of nine satellite television channels operated by Viacom,
four are motion-picture oriented pay channels. Redstone said
exclusive contracts with pay television networks are the
emerging trend. "Up until recently you could see any motion
picture on any pay channel," Redstone said.
    He noted Viacom has exclusive agreements with two studios
and plans to sign a deal with a third company next month.
    Redstone said the management group's investment bankers
will be paid what is due for termination of its merger
agreement. Such fees could total about 30 mln dlrs. "That will
be a company expense," Redstone said.
    He said BankAmerica &lt;BAC> Corp has had numerous inquiries
from lenders who want to participate in a 2.25 billion dlr
financing for the deal. BankAmerica will provide 592 mln dlrs.
    After the merger, Viacom will be a subsidiary of National
but 17 pct of the company will be in public hands.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>BRITISH AIDE CRITICIZES U.S.PROTECTIONISM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>A senior British official said that
protectionist bills being considered by Congress could trigger
retaliation by the European Community (EEC) and threaten the
global trading system.
    Paul Channon, secretary for trade and industry, said if
Congress passed legislation to curb textile imports, which
would hit EC shipments as well as shipments from major Asian
textile producers, "the community would have to retaliate."
    His comments echoed those made yesterday by Belgian Trade
Minister Herman De Croo, who said if the bill passed, the
community would retaliate by imposing taxes on U.S. exports.
    Channon made his remarks at a news conference after two
days of talks with Reagan Administration officials and members
of Congress.
    De Croo was also in Washington for trade talks.
    Channon said there was a greater protectionism sentiment in
Congress since his visit here last year as Congress and the
Administration tried to find ways to reduce the U.S. trade
deficit, which last year hit a record 169.8 billion dlrs.
    Channon also called for greater EC-U.S. cooperation to
force Japan to open its markets to foreign goods.
    Channon said Japan's trade surplus is causing everyone
problems - its surplus with the United States last year was
51.5 billion dlrs and with EC nations, 16.7 billion dlrs.
    "The more united pressure there could be, the better," he
said.
    Channon also called for increased U.S.-EC cooperation to
avoid trade disputes.
    He said the two sides narrowly avoided a confrontation
earlier this year over lost grains sales when Spain and
Portugal joined the community and its liberal imports
regulations were tightened to conform to EC standards.
    "But if both sides drew back from the brink that time," he
said, ""it does not mean that they would do so on another
occasion."
    Channon added that "There is increasing reesentment in
Europe over the U.S. tactic of negotiating under the pressure
of unilaterally imposed deadlines."
    He said other potential conflicts are already in sight -
alleged European government subsidies of Airbus aircraft and
taxes on fats and oils - and "the commuity and the United States
must therefore learn to manage their relations better."
    He said another bill to let the United States retaliate
against a nation if that nation's market was not open to U.S.
goods would bypass the trade pact GATT (General Agreeeement on
Tariffs and Trade) as an arbiter of trade practices.
    He said foreign trade law should be judged by GATT and not
by the United States, adding "if the (trade) law is to be
interpreted by the United States and not by the GATT, what is
to happen to the rest of us?"

Yeutter said he hoped the U.S. dollar would continue to decline
in relation to the currencies of Taiwan and South Korea as a
way to improve the U.S. trade picture.
    Testifying before the House Appropriations subcommittee
which must approve his agency's 1988 budget, he said, "In my
judgment economic factors justify a continued decline."
    Asked by a committee member if he expected a further
decline, and how much, Yeutter said the Taiwan and South Korean
currencies should be adjusted to reflect "positive factors" in
their economies.

revised to 5.26 mln tonnes (raw value), down four pct from the
previous forecast and five pct below the previous season, the
U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    In its World Production and Trade Report, the department
attributed the decline to relatively poor profitability of
sugar, causing harvested area of cane and beets to decline
seven pct from 1985/86.
    Beet sugar production for 1986/87 is now estimated at
837,000 tonnes, five pct less than earlier forecast and down
five pct from the previous season, while cane output is
projected at 4.423 mln tonnes, down four pct from previously
forecast and five pct below the previous season, it said.

<TITLE>TWA &lt;TWA> TANGLES PIEDMONT &lt;PIE> SITUATION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Patti Domm, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    New York, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Trans World Airlines Inc complicated
the bidding for Piedmont Aviation Inc by offering either to buy
Piedmont suitor USAir Group or, alternatively, to merge with
Piedmont and USAir.
    Piedmont's board was meeting today, and Wall Street
speculated the board was discussing opposing bids from Norfolk
Southern Corp and USAir. The TWA offer was announced shortly
after the Piedmont board meeting was scheduled to begin.
    TWA offered to buy USAir for 52 dlrs cash per share. It
also said it was the largest shareholder of USAir and
threatened to go directly to USAir shareholders with an offer
for 51 pct of the stock at a lower price.
    TWA also said it believed its offer was a better deal for
USAir shareholders than an acquisition of Piedmont, but it said
it alternatively would discuss a three-way combination of the
airlines.
    Market sources and analysts speculated that TWA chairman
Carl Icahn made the offer in order to put his own airline into
the takeover arena.
    "We're just wondering if he's not just trying to get TWA
into play. There's speculation on the street he just wants to
move onto somthing else," said one arbitrager. "We think TWA
might just be putting up a trial balloon."
    Analysts said the offer must be taken seriously by USAir,
but that the airline will probably reject it because the price
is relatively low compared to other airline deals.
    They also said Icahn must prove his offer credible by
revealing financing arrangements. "They need to show their
commitment and their ability to finance. I think it's a
credible offer," said Timothy Pettee, a Bear Stearns analyst.
    "I think it's certainly on the low end of relative values
of airline deals," said Pettee. Pettee estimated 58 dlrs would
be in a more reasonable range based on other airline mergers.
    USAir stock soared after TWA made public its offer. A
spokesman for USAir declined comment, and said USAir had not
changed its offer for Piedmont. USAir offered of buy 50 pct of
that airline's stock for 71 dlrs cash per share and the balance
for 73 dlrs per share in USAir stock.
    USAir closed up 5-3/8 at 49-1/8 on volume of 1.9 mln
shares.
    Piedmont, which slipped 1/2 to close at 69-5/8, also
remained silent on the TWA action. Piedmont has an outstanding
65 dlr cash per share offer from Norfolk Southern Corp.
    Norfolk Southern declined comment, but said it stuck with
its offer for Piedmont. Norfolk owns about 20 pct of Piedmont
and opened the bidding when it said it would propose a takeover
of Piedmont.
    Some analysts said Icahn may be trying to acquire USAir to
make his own airline a more attractive takeover target.
    "Icahn I think had wanted to sell his airline and there
were no takers. I think the strategy might have called for
making his investment more attractive. One way to accomplish
that specific objective is to go out and acquire other
airlines," said Andrew Kim of Eberstadt Fleming.
    "I don't know whose going to buy them, but at least this
way it becomes a much more viable package," said Kim.
    But Icahn's financing ability for such a transaction
remains in doubt, in part because of TWA's heavy debt load.
    Wall street sources said TWA has some cash with which to do
the offer.
    The sources said Icahn has not lined up outside financial
advisers and plans to make his own arrangements.
   Icahn earlier this year abandoned plans to buy USX Corp &lt;X>
and still retains 11 pct of that company's stock.
    Some Wall street sources said the financier's USX plan was
impacted by the cloud hanging over his adviser, Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc, because of Wall Street's insider trading scandal.
    Industry sources also predicted USAir might reject the TWA
offer on price and financing concerns. "It's littered with
contingencies and it doesn't even have a financing
arrangement," said one executive at another major airline.
    But the executive conceded a merged TWA-USAir would be a
strong contender with USAir's east coast route system and
planned west coast presence from PSA. USAir could feed the
intenrational flights of TWA, which has a midwest presence in
its St. Louis hub. Adding Piedmont, dominant in the southeast,
to the mix would develop an even stronger force.
    The combined entity would also have TWA's pars reservation
system.
    Such a merger would be complex and analysts said it would
result in an airline iwth an 18 pct market share.

<TITLE>YEUTTER PLANS TRADE TRIP TO CHINA THIS SUMMER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter said he plans a July trip to China to discuss trade
issues including China's admission to the General Agreements on
Tariffs and Trade.
    Yeutter told a congressional hearing it was possible China
could be a member of GATT before the end of the year.
    "They are making major moves to becoming a full scale member
of the world economy," he told the House Appropriations
subcommittee which oversees his agency's budget.
    Depending on how the negotiations go on the terms of
China's GATT membership, Yeutter said he could put the final
touches on the U.S. part of the agreement during his trip.    
The admission of China to GATT, which is the multinational
group of nations which negotiates international rules on trade,
would offer both potential export markets and potential
competition for U.S. industries, he said.
    "That has a lot of potential as well as risks for U.S.
business," Yeutter said.
    "I think China will develop into a fine market for us," he
added.

<TITLE>RIO COFFEE TRADE PREFERS NO PACT TO QUOTA CUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The failure of talks to introduce
new coffee export quotas within the International Coffee
Agreement, ICA, was preferable to the alternative of Brazil
having a sharply reduced quota, as had been proposed, President
of the Rio de Janeiro Coffee Trade Association Carlos Calmon
said.
    He told Reuters proposals to reduce Brazil's quota to 25
pct of the world share from 30 pct at present were unacceptable
as the country has large stocks and a good harvest is expected.
    "Brazil has the capacity to export 20 mln bags this year,"
Calmon added.
    Calmon said, assuming a 58 mln bag global ICA quota,
Brazil's share under the proposals would have been 14.5 mln
bags, of which soluble would have accounted for 2.0 mln,
leaving just 12.5 mln bags of green coffee for export.
    "It's a pity the talks broke down, but for Brazil this was
better than such a quota reduction," he added.
    In 1985 Brazil exported 19.6 mln bags of soluble and green
coffee, including about two mln bags to non-members. A severe
drought and marketing problems cut exports last year to under
10 mln bags.
    Calmon estimated stocks as of January 1 at 18 mln bags, of
which 5.0 mln have already been sold for export. The harvest
this year should be around 30 mln bags, he added.
    The latest Brazilian Coffee Institute estimate for last
year's harvest is 11.2 mln bags, although many traders believe
it was higher than this.

cabinet-level Economic Policy Council is scheduled to meet
Friday to discuss, among other issues, the status of
agricultural legislation, administration officials said.
    The officials said discussion of a U.S. Agriculture
Department wheat export subsidy to the Soviet Union was not on
the agenda. Matters not on the agenda, however, can be brought
before the council, the officials said.
    Grain trade officials have speculated that USDA would make
a wheat export enhancement offer to Moscow, but USDA officials
have said the matter is not under active consideration.
    USDA today transmitted to Congress a package of legislative
proposals, including bills that would cut target prices and
speed up loan rate reductions.

<TITLE>U.S. REAFFIRMS OPPOSITION TO EC OILS TAX PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>A meeting among government agencies
today reaffirmed the strong opposition of the United States to
a proposed new tax on vegetable oils and fats in the European
Community, U.S. trade officials said.
    Representatives of the major government agencies agreed at
a trade policy review group meeting, which includes officials
of the deputy secretary rank, to continue diplomatic pressure
on EC member states.
    "We (all agencies) are together on this," said one U.S.
trade official.
    One source said the U.S. would continue to make clear to
member states and to the EC commission that if Brussels
proceeds with the vegetable oils tax "there will be a great
cost."
    U.S. officials said no formal list of European products on
which the U.S. might retaliate, has yet been drawn up.
    "I don't think we're at that point yet," said one trade
official, adding that the EC has only begun deliberations on
its farm price package.
    Suzanne Early, assistant trade representative, told Reuters
the interagency meeting was to discuss U.S. strategy on the
vegetable oils issue. Asked about retaliation, she said
"sometimes its better not to be specific."
    U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter Monday warned
another major transatlantic trade row will develop if the EC
proceeds with the vegetable oils tax.

<TITLE>CANADA CENTRAL BANK HEAD SEES MODERATE GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bank of Canada Governor John Crow said he
expects the Canadian economy will grow moderately in the coming
year, despite the near flat growth in the final quarter of
1986.
    "We see moderate growth," Crow told a news conference
following presentation of the central bank's annual report in
the House of Commons today.
    He said there were positive signs of growth in the economy,
particularly the drawdown of business inventories in the fourth
quarter. Yesterday, Statistics Canada reported gross domestic
product expanded a slight 0.2 pct in the quarter.
    Crow reiterated the bank's previous statements that
inflation remains a major priority in setting monetary policy
and said only zero inflation would be acceptable. Canada's
inflation rate is currently hovering around the four pct mark.
    The governor said Canada's banking system remains sound
despite recent concern about exposure by the country's banks in
debt plagued countries such as Brazil.
    "It (the debt problem) is not a happy development but I
think it can be overplayed in terms of its impact," Crow told
reporters.

<TITLE>ALLIS-CHALMERS &lt;AH> PROPOSES RESTRUCTURING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MILWAUKEE, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Allis-Chalmers Corp said it asked
lenders and other groups to approve a restructuring plan that
would cause a dilution of the company's existing common stock.
    The company said it would sell all of its businesses other
than the American Air Filter business, make a public financing
of more than 100 mln dlrs and pay part of the currently
outstanding debt with the proceeds.
    Under the plan, which was presented to institutional
lenders, the company's unions and the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corp, "substantial amounts" of institutional debt would be
converted to common stock of the restructured company.
    Allis-Chalmers said it will exchange existing preferred
stock for common. The exchange of the institutional debt and
preferred stock for common equity will cause a "resulting
dilution of the existing common stock," Allis-Chalmers said in
a statement.
    Under the plan, holders of existing common would hold about
15 pct of the restructured common stock. Holders of existing
preferred would hold about 35 pct of the new common.
    Allis-Chalmers said its only alternative to the plan is
bankruptcy. The restructuring must be approved by creditors,
common and preferred holders,and present and former employees.
    Allis-Chalmers said a bankruptcy filing "appears to
represent the company's only alternative if agreement upon the
terms of the plan cannot be reached."
    The spokesman said in response to an inquiry that he was
not aware of any extraordinary charge against earnings that
would result from the restructuring.
    "It is too early to talk about a charge" because the plan
must still be approved by the lenders and unions, he said.
    Also under the plan, payments to Allis-Chalmers' private
lenders would be deferred. Trade payables and obligations
incurred in the ordinary course of business will be met.
    Payment of health benefits for active and retired employees
would be made "at substantially reduced levels."
    Allis-Chalmers, once one of the leading farm equipment
companies, sold all of its farm equipment operations to Deutz
of West Germany for 107 mln dlrs, leaving the company with
businesses in lift trucks, air conditioning, fluids handling
and solid materials processing.
    Last year, Allis-Chalmers sold the lift truck business to
AC Material Handling Co of Columbus, Ohio.
    Under the restructuring plan, Allis-Chalmers will sell its
solid materials processing and fluids handling businesses.
Solid materials processing, which makes equipment to crush
stones for highway construction, accounted for 288 mln dlrs of
Allis-Chalmers's total 1985 revenues of 886 mln dlrs.
    The company will also sell its fluids handling operations,
which makes pumps and valves. That business accounted for 196
mln dlrs of the company's 1985 revenues.
    Allis-Chalmers in 1986 reported a net loss of 8.6 mln dlrs,
or 1.09 dlrs a share. In 1985, the company lost 168.4 mln dlrs,
or 12.27 dlrs a share.
    The company's last profit was in 1980, when it earned 52.4
mln dlrs on sales of 2.1 billion dlrs.

<TITLE>YEUTTER CONCERNED ABOUT U.S. EXPORT PICTURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter said he expects imports to fall soon but he was
concerned about the lack of improvement in U.S. exports given
the dollar's decline in the last 18 months.
    "I'm convinced we're about to see an improvement on the
import side. I'm more concerned about the export side," he told
a House Appropriations subcommittee.
    Part of the blame goes on other countries which have not
generated the economic growth to increase demand for U.S. goods
and part to some U.S. companies which are not generating
competitive exports, he said.

    Talks with Argentina over 2.15 billion dlrs of new loans

to Argentina's original offer. Bankers remain hopeful that an
agreement can be reached by the middle of the month.

products supplied rose 2.1 pct in the four weeks ended February
27 to 16.39 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 16.05 mln in the
same period a year ago, the Energy Information Administration

    In its weekly petroleum status report, the Energy

1.9 pct from 1.44 mln, the EIA said.
    Domestic crude oil production was estimated at 8.38 mln

    Refinery crude runs in the four weeks were 12.21 mln bpd,
up 2.2 pct from 12 mln a year earlier, it said.

<DATELINE>    Bogota, march 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>the sharp fall in international coffee
prices will not affect colombia's external credit situation,
finance minister cesar gaviria told reuters.
    "our foreign debt is high, but we can pay, and I hope the
foreign banking community will maintain its position toward us,"
he said.
    He said the current decline on world coffee markets was not
totally unexpected and would have no immediate bearing on
colombia's financial state, which he described as sound.
    Gaviria said the decline in coffee prices could mean a loss
of 1.5 billion dlrs in revenues for 1987.
    The conservative party and the country's largest trade
union called this week for the debt to be rescheduled following
the price drop.
    Colombia, the only major latin american country not to have
rescheduled its external public debt, has a total foreign debt
of 13.6 billion dlrs.

nations to agree on new export quotas needed to tighten an
oversupplied coffee market, Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis
Bra Kanon told reporters that traders would eventually be
obliged to restore their positions.
    "I am convinced the market is going to reverse by April," he
told a news conference here at his return from the failed
London talks.
    Robusta coffee beans for May delivery ended the day in
London down about 50 sterling at 1,265 sterling a tonne, the
lowest since 1982.
    Bra Kanon estimated at at least 535 billion CFA francs
(1.76 billion dlrs) the overall loss in revenues earned by
Ivory Coast from all its commodities exports this year if the
slide on the world markets continues.
    He disclosed that his country - the world's biggest cocoa
producer and the third largest for coffee -- would spearhead an
African initiative to reach a compromise formula by the end of
next month.
    Ivory Coast has been chosen by the Abidjan-based
Inter-African Coffee Organisation (IACO) to speak on behalf of
the continent's 25 producer nations at the London talks.
    "An initiative from IACO is likely very soon," he said
without elaborating.
    "Following the London collapse, we have immediately embarked
on a concertation course to avoid breaking an already fragile
market," he said.
    Questioned by journalists, the minister said President
Felix Houphouet-Boigny estimated for the moment that his
government would not be forced to reduce the price guaranteed
by the state to Ivorian coffee-growers for the current season.
    Last year, the West African nation announced that the
coffee producer price would stay at 200 CFA francs (65 cents)
per kilo.
    Bra Kanon said that his country would strive to diversify
its agricultural production to avoid beeing too dependent from
world market fluctuation.
    A communique read over the state-run television tonight
said that during today's weekly cabinet meeting, the veteran
Ivorian leader reaffirmed "his faith in Ivory Coast's bright
(economic) future" despite the commodities price slide.
    The Agriculture Minister also announced the government
decided to earmark a sum of 7.5 billion CFA francs (24.71 mln
dlrs) to support the country's small farmers.
    Financially-strapped Ivory Coast, long regarded as one of
Africa's showpiece economies, is going through difficult times
following the sharp slump in the world price of cocoa and
coffee.
    Ivory Coast's real gross domestic product is expected to
grow only one pct this year compared to five pct in 1986,
according to a recent Finance Ministry estimate.

<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>New Zealand's current account deficit
narrowed to 180 mln N.Z. Dlrs in January from 203 mln, revised
from 207 mln, in December and 305 mln in January 1986, in a
smoothed measurement, the Statistics Department said.
    Unsmoothed figures show a deficit of 162 mln dlrs for
January against 107 mln, revised from 75 mln for December 1986

    The smoothed series -- adjusted to iron out random
fluctuations -- shows a widening surplus on merchandise trade
to 46 mln from a surplus of 33 mln, revised from 43 mln dlrs in
December and a 71 mln deficit in the a year ago period.
    Exports were 905 mln dlrs against 929 mln, revised from 971

    Unadjusted merchandise figures show a surplus of 53 mln
dlrs vs 141 mln, revised from 203 mln surplus in December 1986
and a 323 mln deficit a year earlier.
    The deficit on invisibles on unsmoothed figures eased to
215 mln dlrs from 248 mln, revised from 277 mln in December and
252 mln in January 1986.
    The smoothed deficit on invisibles fell to 226 mln from 237

<TITLE>CHARTS SIGNAL BULLISH BREAKOUT IN DEBT FUTURES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Brad Schade, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The rally Wednesday in U.S. interest
rate futures left the Treasury bond contract above the top of a
three month trading range which signals a bullish chart
breakout, financial analysts said.
    In addition, sluggish U.S. economic data and little sign
that the economy will pick up its pace in the near future may
be enough to send bond futures to all-time highs, the analysts
said.
    "The market is paying more attention to the weakened state
of the economy right now," said Refco analyst Mike Connery.
    Connery said the four pct drop in January U.S. factory
orders reinforced sentiment that first quarter economic growth
will be slow.
    Connery and other analysts noted that talk of a cut in the
Lombard rate after sluggish West German industrial production
figures also provided some support.
    "The domestic economies of the major trading partners of
the U.S. may deteriorate to such an extent that they will be
forced to ease," thus paving the way for a more accomodative
U.S. credit policy, added John Michael, analyst at First
Options of Chicago.
    Michael pointed out, however, that trimming the U.S. trade
deficit -- the ultimate aim of the recent meeting of major
industrial countries -- may not necessarily aid bond prices.
    "The surplus (for exporters to the U.S.) is bullish for
bonds because they (exporters) have a lot of dollars. Rather
than translate those into their own currencies and suffer
exchange rate risk, they buy dollar-denominated instruments,"
Michael said.
    Indeed, futures traders with cash bond connections said
some of the late strength in the bond market resulted from
buying by Japanese interests.
    But the analysts said the heavy buying in futures occurred
after the June bond broke above stiff resistance at 101-2/32.
    "The breakout is pretty important," said chartist Leslie
Keefe of Technical Data Corp of Boston. "Not only did bonds
close above recent highs but they were also above the sideways
pattern we've been in for the last three months."
    Also positive on a technical basis was the fact that the
June bond contract held chart support early near 100-4/32, and
that the rally occurred on heavy volume, Keefe said.
    Keefe said the next level of significant chart resistance
will be at 101-24/32 to 101-28/32. Furthermore, "we still have
the April (1986) highs to contend with," which in the nearby
contract is 105-15/32.
    Michael said the breakout projects gains to 103 in June
T-bonds and "there is an outside chance to reach 106."
    Keefe warned, however, that confirmation also is needed
from other technical indicators such as relative strength
indexes and short-term momentum indicators.
    "Without them, sustained strength is in question," Keefe
said.

<TITLE>REAGAN'S REMARKS HELP GOLD TO RECOVER IN HONG KONG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Gold rose by about 50 U.S. Cents an
ounce, following a statement by President Ronald Reagan that
the arms-for-hostages deal with Iran "was a mistake," dealers
said.
    Bullion rose to 409.40/90 dlrs from an initial low of
408.90/409.40. This compares with the opening of 409.00/50 and
New York's close of 410.00/50.
    Dealers noted mild short-covering in the metal after some
initial selling by local investors. Trading was fairly quiet
this morning partly owed to the slow U.S. Dollar activities,
they added.
    However, Reagan's remarks had only a short-lived bullish
impact on the gold price, which is now stabilising at 409.10/60
dlrs, dealers said.
    On the local market, the metal traded in a narrow range of
3,800 and 3,805 H.K. Dlrs a tael against yesterday's 3,778
close.

<TITLE>UNUSUALLY DRY WEATHER AFFECTS CHINA'S AGRICULTURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Abnormally warm and dry weather over most
parts of China is seriously affecting crops, the New China News
Agency said.
    It said the drought has made rice planting difficult in
eight provinces, including Guangxi, Sichuan and Hunan. Plant
diseases and insect pests have increased in wheat-producing
areas, it said.
    The agency said some areas of Guangxi, Hubei, Shanxi and
other provinces have been suffering a drought for more than
seven months.
    The agency said the dry weather had reduced the amount of
water stored by more than 20 pct compared with last March,
lowered the water level of many rivers, reduced hydroelectric
power supplies and caused water shortages for industry and
consumers.
    The upper reaches of the Yangtze are at their lowest levels
in a century, causing many ships to run aground and making
harbour manoeuvres difficult, it said.
    The drought has also increased the number of forest fires.
More than 1,000 fires in southern China had destroyed 13,340
hectares of forest by mid-February, it said.

<TITLE>TAIWAN SHIPBUILDER LOOKS FOR JAPANESE VENTURES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Chen Chien-kuo, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Taiwan's state-owned China Shipbuilding
Corp (CSBC) plans to seek joint production agreements with
Japan and further diversify into ship repairing to try to trim
its debts, chairman Louis Lo said.
    He told Reuters in an interview that CSBC's first joint
production venture, to build two hulls for &lt;Onomichi Dockyard
Co Ltd>, was a success. Talks on similar projects have been
held with other Japanese firms, including Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries Co Ltd &lt;MITH.T> and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy
Industries Co Ltd &lt;JIMA.T>, he said.
    Lo said CSBC delivered the hulls of two 2,200-TEU (twenty
foot equivalent unit) container ships this year to Onomichi,
which would complete production.
    "We expect the successful cooperation between us and
Onomichi will pave the way for further cooperation with other
Japanese shipbuilders in the future," Lo said.
    He said Japanese firms would gain from the lower cost of
shipbuilding in Taiwan while CSBC would benefit from Japanese
technology and marketing. This would pose a challenge to
competitors in Europe and South Korea.
    Lo said CSBC has made losses of about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs
since beginning operations in 1975. Its total debt now stands
at about 500 mln dlrs, with annual interest payments of nearly
three mln dlrs.
    But he said the company, which is Taiwan's largest
shipbuilder, still has full government support and had begun
diversifying into ship repairing and manufacture of pipes and
other machinery.
    "We hope we can survive and prosper through diversification,"
he said.
    Lo said income from ship repairing almost doubled to 20 mln
U.S. Dlrs in the year ended June 1986 compared with the
previous financial year. He estimated income would rise to more
than 25 mln dlrs in 1986/87.
    CSBC has orders to build 10 ships totalling 460,000 dead
weight tons (dwt) this financial year, compared with 11 ships
of 462,000 dwt in 1985/86, he said.
    Lo said the prospects for shipbuilding were gloomy at least
until 1991 due to overtonnage, but the outlook for ship
repairing was bright.

<TITLE>CREDITORS SEEK SWIFT RESCUE PACKAGE FOR JAPAN LINE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>A group of creditor banks hopes to work
out a rescue package for Japan Line Ltd &lt;JLIT.T>, one of the
world's largest tanker operators, by the end of Japan's
business year on March 31, a spokesman for the Industrial Bank
of Japan Ltd &lt;IBJT.T> (IBJ) said.
    Japan Line's cumulative debt was 68.98 billion yen at the
end of September, which exceeded shareholders' equities and
reserves totalling 63.40 billion.
    In December, Japan Line asked banks to shelve repayment of
about 124 billion yen in outstanding loans and about 153
billion in loans to its subsidiaries.
    Japan Line said then that the yen's steep rise and the
world shipping recession had hit the company hard.
    The Japanese daily Asahi Shimbun said today that IBJ and
three other banks plan to abandon a total of 16 billion yen in
loans to Japan Line and a group of creditor banks plans to buy
seven billion yen of new Japan Line shares.
    The spokesman for IBJ, Japan Line's largest creditor, said
the package may write off part of the outstanding loans and
will be worked out before long.
    Commenting on the article, he said the details of the
package have not yet been settled.

<TITLE>OPEC STICKING FIRM ON OFFICIAL PRICES - SUBROTO</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>OPEC countries are all sticking firmly to
official crude oil prices but the volatility of spot prices is
likely to continue into the third quarter, Indonesian Minister
of Mines and Energy Subroto told Reuters.
    Subroto, attending a Pacific Energy Cooperation conference,
blamed recent rapid spot price changes on unbalanced supply and
demand. "If we stick to the production limitation, the third
quarter will be in better balance."
    He said the market is in a period of transition while the
impact of OPEC's December agreement to cut output and fix
prices at an average 18 dlrs a barrel is worked through.
    Asked whether OPEC members of the Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) had any concrete proposals to help Qatar sell its crude
oil in the face of strong resistance to its official prices,
Subroto said: "Apparently they have taken care of that."
    "They (the GCC) meet very often among themselves. I think
they'll help each other," he said.
    Subroto said that as he was not a member of OPEC's Price
Differentials Committee he did not know why the meeting had
been postponed from its scheduled April 2 date.
    "Maybe they find it is better not to have the meeting
because ... Everyone is sticking to official prices," he said.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EUROYEN BOND ISSUES INCREASE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jeff Stearns, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The easing of rules governing overseas use
of the yen has caused an explosion of Euroyen bond activity but
has failed to turn the yen into a truly international currency,
bond managers and traders said.
    Although yen bonds now rank second only to dollar issues in
the Eurobond market, few foreigners are interested in keeping
the yen they borrow and no one wants the yen bonds but the
Japanese, they said. This lack of real yen demand through the
freer Euroyen market is undermining the 1984 U.S. And Japanese
accord to internationalise the yen, they said.
    The borrowers want to take advantage of low Japanese
interest rates but have no need for yen. They arrange primarily
with Japanese banks to exchange yen funds into other
currencies, mainly dollars, bond managers said. More than 85
pct of Euroyen bond issues are swap driven, they added.
    "The borrowers don't care which currency they use. They are
only after attractive money," one bond trader said.
    Issues doubled to more than 150 in 1986 from the previous
year, boosting Euroyen offerings to more than nine pct of the
total Eurobond market, Koichi Kimura, managing director of
Daiwa Securities Co Ltd, said recently.
    Traders said some of the activity stems from battles among
Japanese and foreign securities companies and banks for the
prestige of placing a larger share of issues. Many even resort
to "harakiri" swaps, those with unprofitable pricing.
    But the fever continues and the number of offerings could
double again in 1987, said Naoki Yokoyama, manager of Nikko
Securities Co Ltd's international capital markets operation.
    The Euroyen bonds, once issued, are mostly picked up by
Japanese trust banks, one trader said. After a 90 day waiting
period the bonds flow back to Japan where investor appetite is
strong, he added.
    Foreign investors are reluctant to invest in yen when more
attractive yields are offered on dollar and other currency
investments, traders said.
    "Even aggressive foreign investors have stopped investing
(in yen)," said Masaki Shimazu, manager of Daiwa's bond
department.
    While few foreigners are interested in the secondary
market, Japanese commercial banks, regional banks, life
insurers and other financial institutions are eager to buy the
bonds and await their flow back to Japan since they offer
little currency risk, traders said.
    The Finance Ministry last April shortened the waiting
period before issues could flow back to Japan to 90 days from
180. A ministry official said it verified through sampling that
reflow was fairly small.
    "We believe the Euroyen bond should remain mainly in the
Euroyen market," he said.
    One trader said that although demand from Japanese
investors is heavy, it may prove to be only short-term. He said
many investors plan to sell their bonds if Japanese or U.S.
Interest rates decline further.
    To encourage further international use of the yen, the
ministry is considering allowing the issue of Euroyen
commercial paper, the official said, adding that it is studying
demand from potential borrowers.
    Securities company sources believe the ministry will permit
non-residents to issue Euroyen commercial paper within the next
few months. But they expect it to continue to ban domestic
participation in the market for some time to come. Japanese
banks object to the short-term paper market which they see
encroaching on their business territory.
    Traders said Euroyen commercial paper could spur more
demand overseas for the yen by allowing opportunities to shift
into shorter-term securities if need be.
    "Commercial paper might encourage fewer swaps," one bond
manager said. If more financial instruments were available,
there might be more trades in yen, he added.
    Euroyen bonds must now carry a five-year maturity, though
some recent issues which are callable in three years work as if
they had shorter maturities, traders said.
    The ministry is expected to allow four-year Euroyen bond
maturities within a few months.
    One yen bond manager said Japanese financial authorities
are giving up a lot of their control in liberalising the rules
governing international transactions of the yen. But freer use
of the yen could encourage more trade settlements in the
Japanese currency, he said. "If exporters or importers can raise
funds in yen, they will be more willing to agree to using the
Japanese yen as a settlement currency," he added.
    The Finance Ministry official said the government must
constantly consider ways to improve markets for the benefit of
borrowers and investors. "No major market can keep its status
without change," he said.

<DATELINE>    BANGKOK, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Thailand's main paddy crop is expected
to fall to 15.4 mln tonnes in the 1986/87 (Nov/Oct) season from
a previous 15.68 mln estimate in November and an actual 17.35
mln a year ago, the Thai Rice Mills Association said.
    It said a joint field survey late last month by the
association, the Commerce Ministry and the Bank of Thailand
indicated that paddy output in Thailand's northeast region is
lower than expected because of a drought in several provinces.
    The association said rice growing areas in Nakhon
Ratchasima, Chaiyaphum, Khon Kaen and Mahasarakam were
especially affected by low rainfalls in the second half of
1986.
    It said last November that the drought reduced total
national areas sown with paddy to some 8.25 mln hectares this
year, down from 8.84 mln a year ago.
    The main crop represents about 85 pct of Thailand's paddy
output.

<TITLE>BHP TO FLOAT GOLD UNIT WITH ONE-FOR-THREE ISSUE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MELBOURNE, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd &lt;BRKN.S>
(BHP) said it plans a renounceable one-for-three issue of
rights to float a new company, &lt;BHP Gold Mines Ltd> (BHPGM),
which will hold most of BHP's gold interests.
    In a statement BHP said the 25-cent par rights would be
priced at 50 cents for 430 mln of the BHPGM shares on offer.
BHP will subscribe for the remaining 540 mln shares, or 56 pct
of issued capital, on the same terms.
    BHPGM will pay 440 mln dlrs for BHP's gold interests,
excluding its stake in Papua New Guinea's &lt;Ok Tedi Mining Ltd>
and those interests held by BHP's &lt;Utah International Inc>.
    The BHP statement said the issue will be made to
shareholders registered on March 27. It opens April 4 and
closes April 29, and is underwritten by &lt;J.B. Were and Son>.
Rights will be traded on Australian stock exchanges from March
23 to April 22, and the new shares will be quoted from June 4.
    BHP said the new company will be one of Australia's larger
gold producers, with annual output exceeding 170,000 ounces. It
said there are plans to boost production to 300,000 ounces by
the early 1990s. BHPGM's portfolio will include several
Australian mines -- 30 pct of Telfer, 100 pct of Ora Banda and
Browns Creek and 20 pct of the new Boddington development.
    The statement said BHPGM would also hold BHP's 45 pct stake
in the Coronation Hill Property in the Northern Territory, and
its 55 pct stake in a new venture near Gympie, Queensland.
    BHPGM chairman-designate John Gough said it was a quality
gold stock.
    "The diversity and depth of BHP Gold's portfolio ... Give
the company a sound foundation in current gold production and
an exciting potential for growth," he said.

<TITLE>HK BANK EXPECTED TO POST 10 TO 13 PCT PROFIT RISE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Allan Ng, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp
&lt;HKBH.HK> is likely to show a rise in profit of between 10 and
13 pct for 1986, reflecting stronger than expected loan growth,
share analysts polled by Reuters said.
    Their estimates of the bank's net earnings for last year
ranged from 2.99 to 3.1 billion H.K. Dlrs. Results will be
announced on Tuesday. The 1985 net profit was 2.72 billion.
    They forecast a final dividend of 29 cents for a total of
42 cents for the year against 38 cents in 1985, adjusted for a
one-for-five bonus issue.
    Analysts said they expected the bank to recommend a bonus
issue this year, probably one for three or one for five.
    The bank's 61.5 pct subsidiary Hang Seng Bank Ltd &lt;HSGH.HK>
is to report its 1986 results on Friday.
    Analysts expect Hang Seng to announce net profit of more
than one billion dlrs for the first time, an increase of 10 to
12 pct.
    They expect Hang Seng to pay a final dividend of 1.37 dlrs
for a total of 1.75 dlrs for the year against 1.60 in 1985.
    Analysts said that while the use of undisclosed inner
reserves by banks here makes forecasting very imprecise,
Hongkong Bank benefited from the unexpected strength of the
Hong Kong economy in 1986, when gross domestic product grew by
nearly nine pct against an initial forecast of 4.5 pct.
    "They benefited considerably from the pickup in loan demand,
as their loan portfolio is well balanced," an analyst at Mansion
House Securities (F.E.) Ltd said.
    Government figures show that total loans and advances rose
by 13.8 pct in 1986, compared with a 4.5 pct increase in 1985.
    Loans to finance Hong Kong's visible trade, the mainstay of
the local economy, rose by 15.1 pct against a decline of five
pct in 1985.
    Low interest rates also helped the bank. Interest received
on loans was low, with the prime rate at 6.5 pct at end-1986,
but interest paid on savings was two pct. Hongkong Bank and
Hang Seng Bank control half of all deposits in the banking
system, giving them access to a large base of low-cost funds.
    The strength of the real-estate market was another major
income source for the bank group. Loans to finance property
development and instalment mortgages rose sharply.
    "The Hongkong Bank group is still the leader in mortgage
business despite tough competition from the Bank of China group
and other foreign banks," one analyst said.
    The high level of activity on the capital and equities
markets in 1986 contributed to a sharp improvement in Hongkong
Bank subsidiaries Wardley Ltd &lt;WAIA.HK> and &lt;James Capel and
Co>, analysts said. "Wardley had a tremendous year acting as
financial adviser and underwriter," an analyst said.
    Wardley was underwriter for last year's billion-dlr
flotation of &lt;Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd>, of which Hongkong
Bank owned 30 pct at the time.
    The bank's stake has since been cut to 16.4 pct in return
for 1.57 billion dlrs. It also sold its entire 48.8 pct stake
in &lt;South China Morning Post Ltd>, the larger of two
English-language daily newspapers here, for 1.18 billion dlrs.
    The proceeds will go to reserves for acquisitions and will
not show up in the profit and loss accounts, analysts said.
    Analysts said the bank had also been helped by a reduced
need to write off bad debts. "The need for provisions was much
lower than the year before," said Tony Measor of Hong Leong
Securities Co Ltd. "Last year's profits should have been 2.8 to
2.9 billion dlrs if not for the huge provisions."
    Former Hongkong Bank chairman Michael Sandberg said the
bank wrote off hundreds of millions of dollars against its
shipping exposure in 1985. Lesley Nickolds of County Securities
Asia Ltd said she saw no major shipping writeoffs in 1986. She
forecast profit of 2.99 billion dlrs.
    The bank's Latin American exposure, mainly through its
51-pct owned Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM>, appears to have
improved substantially, analysts said. Marine Midland's 1986
fourth-quarter loan-loss provisions fell to 44.1 mln U.S. Dlrs
from 89.2 mln a year before. Its 1986 net profit rose to 145
mln U.S. Dlrs from 125 mln in 1985.

<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, Texas, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The directors of Hughes Tool Co
&lt;HT> said they would recommend to shareholders that they reject
a merger with Baker International Corp &lt;BKO> today.
    Hughes vice-president Ike Kerridge said the recommendation
would be put to shareholders at a meeting scheduled for 10 A.M.
Local time (1600 GMT) to discuss the proposed merger.
    Kerridge said the board met yesterday to discuss the merger
but decided against it.
    The Hughes board objected to a U.S. Department of Justice
requirement that Baker sell off several specialised
subsidiaries in businesses related to oil-drilling.
    The Hughes board last week indicated that it might cancel
the merger because of the Department of Justice requirement.
    The board of directors of the California-based Baker had
approved the merger. On February 17 Baker said it had signed an
agreement to sell one of the subsidiaries.
    The companies had been given until April 22 to comply with
the Justice Department requirement, Kerridge said.

projected money market surplus, money market traders said.
    Of the total, 300 billion yen will yield 3.9989 pct on the

27-day repurchase agreement, due April 2.
    The remaining 200 billion yen will yield 3.9994 pct in a

    The repurchase agreement yields compare with the 4.0625 pct
one-month commercial bill discount rate today and the 4.50/43
pct rate on one-month certificates of deposit.
    Tomorrow's surplus in the money market is estimated at 420
billion yen, mainly due to payment of national annuities, money
traders said. The operation will put the outstanding bill
supply at about 1,300 yen.

<TITLE>NEW CURRENCY PROBLEM SEEN AMONG U.S, EUROPE, JAPAN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Eric Hall, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The highly visible drama involving the
yen's sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the fact
that the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major
European currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange rate
distortions, Japanese and European research officials said.
    The officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statements
by the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations, told Reuters the
currency movements of the past two years are also creating a
fundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up new
trade tensions and imbalances.
    Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are
already changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan-
European Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe.
    In many ways, not least in terms of rare international
cooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact between
the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut down
the value of the dollar was a historic one.
    But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major
currency movements which lay bare the real picture, in which
the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but not
necessarily central significance, the officials said.
    The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took
place, the dollar was already on its way down. The agreement
simply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in
Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely.
    "You have to look at the dollar's peak compared with now,
and that was well before Plaza," he said.
    On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at
263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was
242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and
periodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the
dollar trend has been down, down, down.
    Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross
rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The
European currencies are moving back up against the yen.
    The close relationship between exchange rates and trade
flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but
undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is
changing. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC
both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen.
This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.
    Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of
of sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years.
    Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12
pct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports
and 21 pct for imports in yen terms.
    "The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a
tremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit
sold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important
to them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is
laying the golden egg," said de Hora.
    The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year
in Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its
start from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade.
    The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than
U.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate
imbalance, and which will cause problems.
    "This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is
reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But
therefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive
edge," said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International
Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. "If you want
my objective view, I don't expect a drastic improvement in our
trade imbalance. Last year, we asked for moderation in exports,
and this year we may have to do so again," he said.

<TITLE>SPAIN RAISES BANKS' RESERVE REQUIREMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MADRID, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Spain said it raised the
reserve requirement for banks and savings banks to 19 pct of
deposits from 18 pct to drain excess liquidity which threatened
money supply and inflation targets.
    In a statement issued late last night, the central bank
said the measure would take effect from March 13.
    "In recent weeks, there has been excess liquidity in the
Spanish economy which, if not controlled, would threaten the
monetary and inflation targets set by the government," the
statement said.
    Banking sources said the measure would drain about 200
billion pesetas from the system. The maximum reserve
requirement allowed by law is 20 pct.
    The move follows a half-point increase yesterday in the
Bank of Spain's key overnight call money rate, which now stands
at 13.5 pct. At today's auction, however, the bank left the
rate unchanged.
    Spain's principal measure of money supply, the broad-based
liquid assets in public hands (ALP), grew at annualised rate of
8.3 pct in January compared with 11.4 pct during the whole of
1986 and a target of eight pct for 1987.
    Banking sources said that although the January money supply
figures were good, compared with annualised rates of 13.9 pct
in December and 10.2 pct in January 1986, ALP growth appeared
to have accelerated in February, raising government concern.
    Regarding inflation, recent figures have suggested that
prices were under control.
    Secretary of State for Trade, Miguel Angel Fernandez
Ordonez, said this week that the annualised inflation rate for
February, not yet officially announced, fell to 5.5 pct from
six pct in January, compared with inflation of 8.3 pct during
1986 and a government target of five pct for this year.

<TITLE>JAPANESE BANKS SEEN AGREEING DEBT RISK SCHEME</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Tsukasa Maekawa, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese creditor banks are close to a
decision to jointly establish an offshore firm to which they
will transfer part of their title to possibly unrecoverable
debts owed by developing nations, international financial
sources told Reuters.
    Details of the deal are likely be decided next week and the
firm set up before the end of the month, they said.
    The scheme is intended to improve financial management at
the banks and reduce the risk of problems in the event of debts
turning bad, the sources said.
    Last week's announcement by Brazil that it would
indefinitely suspend interest payments on an estimated 68
billion dlrs owed to commercial banks prompted Japanese
creditors to finalise the project, the sources said.
    Major Japanese banks have been considering a plan to avoid
a debt crisis since the start of the year, they said.
    There are likely to be at least 10 participating banks, and
perhaps as many as 28, they said.
    About 30 Japanese commercial banks have outstanding loans
totalling over 10 billion dlrs to Brazil, accounting for about
15 pct of all commercial loans to that country.
    The most likely venue for the envisaged firm is the
Caribbean tax haven of the Cayman Islands, the sources said.
    The idea is to create a pool of funds in the firm with
participating creditor banks holding the firm's stock.
    The firm will then use the funds to buy from its
stock-holding banks title to repayments of specified foreign
loans which are potentially bad, the sources said.
    The stock-holding banks will draw up a list of such loans.
    Subject to the scheme would be loans extended to
debt-ridden countries such as Mexico and Argentina, they said.
    The financial sources said interest payments to the firm
would not be taxed because of its location. Japanese banks have
asked the finance ministry to increase tax breaks on loan loss
reserves, but the ministry has not yet complied.
    A senior ministry official welcomed the scheme and said it
may encourage new lending to developing countries.
    The ministry instructs banks to establish reserves for up
to five pct of their loans to 35 financially troubled
countries, but it only grants tax breaks on reserves accounting
for one pct of the loans.

<TITLE>TAIWAN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES HIT NEW HIGH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves hit a
new high of more than 51 billion U.S. Dlrs on March 4, compared
with 50 billion in mid-February and 25.1 billion a year
earlier, the central bank said.
    Bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters the increase
came mainly from the bank's purchases of more than one billion
U.S. Dlrs on the local interbank market between February 18 and
March 4.
    He said the rise showed signs of slowing, however, because
Taiwan has liberalised import policy and expects its trade
surplus to decline over the next few months as a result.
    Chang declined to predict how high the reserves might rise,
but local economists have forecast they will hit 60 billion
U.S. Dlrs by the end of 1987.
    In January, Taiwan reduced import tariffs of up to 50 pct
on some 1,700 foreign products. It had been under growing U.S.
Pressure to cut its 1986 record 13.6 billion dlr trade surplus
with the U.S. Taiwan's 1985 surplus with the U.S. Was 10.2
billion, according to official statistics.
    Wang Chang-Ming, Vice Chairman of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development, told Reuters the government is
planning another round of deep tariff cuts in the second half
of this year.
    The reserves could support imports of more than two years
for Taiwan, compared with about three months for Japan and the
U.S.

coins with a face value of five Ecus will go on sale from March
23 at a price of 500 Belgian francs each, a Finance Ministry
spokesman said.
    Gold Ecu coins with a face value of 50 Ecus will be sold

these would be fixed just before they go on sale but was likely
to be between 8,500 and 9,000 francs.
    At least two mln silver coins and several hundreds of
thousands of the gold coins will be minted, he said. They will
be sold both in Belgium and abroad.
    The coins will be the first ever denominated in the Ecu,
the "basket" comprised of the 12-nation European Community's
currencies except the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo.
    The issue is being made to mark the 30th anniversary of the
EC's founding Treaty of Rome this month. Finance Minister Mark
Eyskens, who currently presides over the EC's council of
economic and finance ministers, has called the issue a
political act of symbolic value which aimed to make the
Community's goal of monetary integration more concrete.
    The coins will be legal tender in Belgium but most demand
is expected to come from coin collectors.

<TITLE>FIRS SLIGHTLY RAISES EC BEET SUGAR OUTPUT ESTIMATE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The French sugar market intervention
board, FIRS, raised its estimate of 1986/87 beet sugar
production in the 12-member European Community to 13.76 mln
tonnes white equivalent in its end-February report from 13.74
mln a month earlier.
    Its forecast for total EC sugar production, including cane
and molasses, rose to 14.10 mln tonnes from 14.09 mln.
Portugal, which joined the Community in January 1986, was
estimated at 12.75 mln tonnes white equivalent, unchanged from
the previous forecast and compared with 12.41 mln tonnes for
1985/86.
    Production for the current campaign in Spain was higher
than reported last month at 1.03 mln tonnes compared with
997,000 tonnes.
    Beet sugar production, expressed as white equivalent, was
estimated at 3.44 mln tonnes in France, 3.17 mln tonnes in West
Germany, 1.72 mln in Italy, 1.30 mln in Britain, 1.22 mln in

<TITLE>PAPUA NEW GUINEA PLANS RESOURCES INVESTMENT AGENCY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PORT MORESBY, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Papua New Guinea Government
will establish a public corporation to invest in resources
projects, Minerals and Energy Minister John Kaputin said.
    "We intend to provide a means through which less privileged
individuals can become part owners and beneficiaries from the
development of mining and petroleum projects," he told
Parliament.
    Existing policy allowing the state up to 30 pct equity in
major mining projects and 22.5 pct in oil and gas projects
would be maintained, he said. The planned agency could take
over the state's equity in current developments.
    Kaputin said Papua New Guinea was experiencing a boom with
exploration companies spending about 60 mln kina annually on
about 150 mining and 23 petroleum projects.
    "The Government is determined to ensure that Papua New
Guinean ownership in minerals and petroleum projects increases
in an orderly way," he said.
    Kaputin did not say when the corporation would be
established or exactly what form it would take, but said the
government would study whether it should be directly involved
in exploration or development.

<DATELINE>    LAGOS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Nigerian naira firmed 2.6 pct against
the dollar after 17 banks were disqualified from bidding at
today's weekly foreign exchange auction, the central bank said.
The naira finished at 3.8050 to the dollar, against 3.9050 last
week.
    Only 38.39 mln dlrs of the 50 mln dlrs on offer was sold,
with all 27 bidding banks successfully obtaining hard currency.
    The effective rate, including a central bank levy, for
transactions in the coming week, was 3.8241 against 3.9246 last
week.
    The failure to sell the whole allocation was due to the
central bank's unprecedented disqualification of 17 banks as
punishment for inadequate documentation in previous
transactions.
    Banks are required to submit proof that their bids are
based on valid commercial transactions and the central bank has
complained in the past that many are failing to produce the
right paperwork within the specified time.

<TITLE>U.S. TELLS JAPAN TO DO MORE TO CUT TRADE SURPLUS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Undersecretary of State for Economic
Affairs Allen Wallis said he had urged Japan to do much more to
reduce its large trade surplus with the United States.
    "Our central message to Japan this week was that while we
have made progress in some areas, much needs to be done," he
told a press conference after three days of talks.
    "What we need is a resolution of trade issues, we need
visible efforts to restructure the economy to encourage more
imports and we need greater domestic-led growth."
    Forecasting sluggish economic growth in Japan this year,
Wallis urged Tokyo to stimulate domestic demand to help reduce
its trade surplus, which hit a record 83 billion dlrs in 1986.
    He named several areas of particular concern to Washington
-- computer microchips, supercomputers, Kansai airport,
agricultural products and car telephones.
    He warned that the U.S./Japan agreement governing trade in
semiconductors was in jeopardy. Despite the pact, Japanese
producers are still dumping microchips in foreign markets other
than the United States while U.S. Penetration of the Japanese
market has not increased, he said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>GERMAN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK SEEN FAIRLY BRIGHT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KIEL, West Germany, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The outlook for the West
German economy is relatively bright, with gross national
product expected to expand by three pct this year, Kiel
University's Institute for World Economy said.
    The GNP forecast by the institute, one of five leading
economic research bodies in West Germany, is more optimistic
than that of the other institutes, some of which have recently
reduced their GNP forecasts to between two and 2.5 pct.
    In a report the Kiel institute said West Germany's export
outlook has not deteriorated fundamentally despite the mark's
strength against the dollar and other major currencies.
    "The danger that exports will slump in 1987 appears, all in
all, limited," the report said. "On the contrary, a slight rise
in exports can be expected."
    The institute said past experience has shown West German
exporters will move to counterbalance currency factors by
cutting costs, trying to penetrate new markets and adjusting
their product ranges.
    They will be aided in 1987 by an expected slight rise in
economic growth in industrial countries. At the same time, the
decline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slow
this year.
    West German GNP growth in 1987 will be led by renewed
advances in domestic consumption and investment spending, both
of which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetary
policy, the institute said.
    However, it said the labour market would see only a slight
improvement because companies will be reluctant to hire
additional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly by
agreed reductions in working hours.
    The institute cautioned that the expansionary stance of
monetary policy in West Germany was likely to bring a marked
acceleration of inflation.
    It also warned that what it called the worldwide
synchronization of monetary policy heightened the risk of a new
global recession. It said central banks in industrialized
countries, including the Bundesbank, had followed the Federal
Reserve Board's expansionary course.
    The institute said this in turn was bound to lead
eventually to a rise in worldwide inflation and a shift in U.S.
Policy towards a more restrictive policy. Other central banks
were likely to follow suit, causing a recession that could
aggravate the debt crisis of developing countries as well as
increase protectionism around the world.
    Although Germany cannot entirely shield itself from the
negative effects of the global synchronization of monetary
policy, it should do all it can to strengthen the forces of
growth at home.
    The institute said this could be done by ensuring that
fiscal policy fosters a willingness to work and invest. Taxes
should be cut by a greater amount than currently planned, and
wage increases in 1987 and 1988 should be markedly lower than
in 1986. It also said the Bundesbank should reduce inflationary
pressures by cutting the current rate of growth in money supply
to about four pct.

<TITLE>CREDITOR BANKS MAY BUY INTO SINGAPORE COFFEE FIRM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SINGAPORE, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The nine creditor banks of the
Singapore coffee trader &lt;Teck Hock and Co (Pte) Ltd> are
thinking of buying a controlling stake in the company
themselves, a creditor bank official said.
    Since last December the banks have been allowing the
company to postpone loan repayments while they try to find an
overseas commodity company to make an offer for the firm.
    At least one company has expressed interest and
negotiations are not yet over, banking sources said.
    However, the banks are now prepared to consider taking the
stake if they find an investor willing to inject six to seven
mln dlrs in the company but not take control, the banking
sources said.
    Teck Hock's financial adviser, Singapore International
Merchant Bankers Ltd (SIMBL), will work on the new proposal
with the creditor banks, they said.
    Major holdings are likely to be held by the two largest
creditor banks, Standard Chartered Bank &lt;STCH.L> and
Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd &lt;OCBM.SI>, they added.
    Teck Hock owes over 100 mln Singapore dlrs and the creditor
banks earlier this week agreed to let Teck Hock fufill
profitable contracts to help balance earlier losses.
    The nine banks are Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd, United
Overseas Bank Ltd &lt;UOBM.SI>, &lt;Banque Paribas>, &lt;Bangkok Bank
Ltd,> &lt;Citibank NA>, Standard Chartered Bank Ltd, Algemene Bank

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - POLISH SANCTIONS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Irena Czekierska, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WARSAW, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Poland says U.S. Sanctions have cost its
economy 15 billion dlrs and has made clear it wants Washington
to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining
restrictions two weeks ago.
    Polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown
of the figure, saying it takes into account a number of
hypothetical losses. Some of them are "too sophisticated to
convert into financial terms," one banking source said.
    But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is
impossible to calculate.
    They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland's
economy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory.
    "Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under-
achieving. They did have a bad effect, yes, but they only
contributed to largely internal, economic problems," one said.
    The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured
Nation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliation
for suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under
martial law. The estimated cost to the Polish economy was
originally devised several years ago by the Institute of
National Economy, an offshoot of the central planning
commission.
    According to one Western envoy, an expert on Polish
economic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growth
trends in trade with the United States, as well as increases in
credits from Western commercial and government lenders.
    But the calculations were based on a time when trade was
booming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissing
the estimate as "a theoretical projection based on a high point,
which has no real scientific evaluation."
    A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to
the U.S. In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs
annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were
imposed.
    Imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to
200 mln, as credits ran out. Poland has a dwindling trade
surplus with the West. Last year it was one billion dlrs
against a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show.
    Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important
U.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles,
chemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say credits
dried up for economic not political reasons.  "Poland is
accusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for
political reasons," said one expert. "It's an illusion based on a
misunderstanding of Western economy."
    "There's a limit to how much you can go on giving someone
who has no hope of repaying it," another said, adding that
Poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits
in the 1970s which were no longer today's reality.
    Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as "nebulous," one
diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders
and setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of
scientific links and exchanges.  Western officials say the
lifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact
on Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrs
and lacks the means to modernise its industry.
    "MFN doesn't really mean anything, only that Poland will not
be treated worse than other countries. It will be difficult to
regain access to the U.S. Market because different forces are
in play now," said one Western envoy.
    He said Polish products were not competitive, and their
quality was too low. Trade wars and possible protectionist
measures amongst the U.S., Japan and Europe would also hamper
Poland's efforts to regain entry.
    Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised
this fact recently.
    Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, "Making
up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly
difficult, and in certain cases impossible... In a period of
two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of
exports by only about 100 mln dlrs."
    While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says it
has a "moral right" to assistance from the U.S. Which it says
imposed the sanctions illegally. But a Western economist said
"The argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing
of the Polish economy won't cut any ice. The Americans will
just reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushing
Solidarity."
    Nevertheless, Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka, in
talks in Washington last week with the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and World Bank, made it clear that Poland was
looking for a lead from the United States.
    He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet its
financial obligations to the United States, "but not in a short
time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its
foreign economic partners."
    He stressed that the U.S. "had a particular opportunity to
play a part in the cooperative policy of Poland's partners
interested in the settlement of Polish debt."
    Putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamed
Washington for obstructing talks with the World Bank, IMF and
Paris Club of Western creditor governments in recent years and
said it should now play a more positive role.
    "As a major superpower the United States can influence
international organisations," he said, citing recent meetings
aimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to
which Western nations were prepared to cooperate.

<TITLE>U.K. FOURTH QUARTER TRADE DEFICIT 2.6 BILLION STG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Britain had a visible trade deficit of
2.6 billion stg in the fourth quarter of 1986 against a revised
deficit of 2.9 billion in the third quarter, official
statistics show.
    Seasonally-adjusted figures issued by the Central
Statistical Office (CSO) show the current account was in
deficit by 760 mln stg against an upwardly revised third
quarter shortfall of 930 mln.
    For 1986 as a whole, visible trade was in deficit by 8.3
billion stg, sharply up from 1985's 2.2. Billion shortfall and
a 4.4 billion deficit in 1984.
    Preliminary figures for invisible transactions in the
fourth quarter show a surplus 1.8 billion stg to give an
estimated surplus for 1986 of 7.2 billion. The fourth quarter
figure was in line with CSO projections released on Friday.
    The third quarter invisibles surplus was revised down to
1.9 billion stg from 2.25 billion.
    In 1985 the invisibles surplus was 5.1 billion stg.
    The reduced deficit on visible trade in the fourth quarter
was due to an increase in the surplus on oil of 200 mln stg and
a reduction in the non-oil trade deficit of 100 mln, the CSO
said.
    However, 1986's surplus on oil trade was 4.0 billion stg
lower than in 1985, while the deficit on non-oil trade
increased by 2.1 billion.
    The figures were broadly in line with market expectations.
    The CSO stressed that figures for invisible transactions,
particularly for the most recent quarters are liable to
substantial revisions as later information becomes available.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>FRENCH INTERVENTION RATE CUT LIKELY, DEALERS SAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of France is likely to cut its
money market intervention rate by up to a quarter point at the
start of next week.  This follows a steady decline in the call
money rate over the past 10 days and signals from the Finance
Ministry that the time is ripe for a fall, dealers said.
    The call money rate peaked at just above nine pct ahead of
the meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Five
industrial countries and Canada on February 22, which restored
considerable stability to foreign exchanges after several weeks
of turbulence.
    The call money rate dropped to around 8-3/8 pct on February
23, the day after the Paris accord, and then edged steadily
down to eight pct on February 27 and 7-3/4 pct on March 3,
where it has now stabilised.
    Dealers said the Bank of France intervened to absorb
liquidity to hold the rate at 7-3/4 pct.
    While call money has dropped by well over a percentage
point, the Bank of France's money market intervention rate has
remained unchanged since January 2, when it was raised to eight
pct from 7-1/4 pct in a bid to stop a franc slide.
    The seven-day repurchase rate has also been unchanged at
8-3/4 since it was raised by a half-point on January 5.
    The Bank of France has begun using the seven-day repurchase
rate to set an upper indicator for money market rates, while
using the intervention rate to set the floor.
    Sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said
that he would be happy to see an interest rate cut, and dealers
said any fall in the intervention rate was most likely to come
when the Bank of France buys first category paper next Monday,
although an earlier cut could not be excluded.
   A cut in the seven-day repurchase rate could come as early
as tomorrow morning, banking sources said.
    They said recent high interest rates have encouraged an
acceleration in foreign funds returning to France, discouraging
the authorities from making a hasty rate cut. But they also
pointed out that money supply is broadly back on target, giving
scope for a small fall in rates.
    M-3 money supply, the government's key aggregate, finished
1986 within the government's three to five pct growth target,
rising 4.6 pct compared with seven pct in 1985.

<TITLE>HONG KONG CD MARKET SHUTS DOWN AFTER NEW ISSUE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Allan Ng, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Hong Kong dollar fixed rate market
was shut down this afternoon after a 200 mln H.K. Dlr
certificate of deposit issue for the Chinese state-owned Bank
of Communications Ltd Hong Kong branch suddenly surfaced,
bankers said.
    Disgruntled dealers said the market was slowly on the road
to recovery after a bout of sell-off that began in early
February but it was still too fragile to absorb a new issue.
    Brokers said the new deal took them by surprise and all
major players stopped making markets in existing issues.
    The fixed rate market, which consists mainly of CDs tied to
swaps or asset repackaging, began to fall about a month ago due
to indigestion after 18 CD issues totalling 2.3 billion dlrs
flooded the market in January.
    Bankers said the shake-up was a result of participants
pushing the market up too fast in January amid intense
speculation that the Hong Kong dollar's 7.80 peg rate against
the U.S. Dollar would soon be changed.
    The speculation depressed local interest rates and
unleashed a flood of new issues.
    But the speculation faded in early February and interest
rates climbed as the government remained adamant in maintaining
the peg, thus triggering an adjustment on the fixed rate
capital market.
    By late February the market had recovered considerably but
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York
launched their issues and pushed the market down again. Since
then there has been no new issues for nearly two weeks until
China Development Finance Co (H.K.) Ltd (CDFC), a unit of the
Bank of China, launched the five-year deal at 7.05 pct with
quarterly interest payment in mid-afternoon today.
    Brokers said the market was steady early this morning but
began to slip marginally by late morning as rumours of a new
issue circulated.
    When the deal was launched the major players quickly
suspended trading and refused to quote prices for their own
issues, brokers said. "We just don't know where the market is
going," said a European banker.
    They said the Bank of Communications issue traded at a low
of 99.70 but was later pushed up to 99.90/95, within the 10
basis point fee, adding that buying came mainly from sister
banks in the Bank of China group.
    An official with one of the Chinese banks said the deal was
launched at an effective yield of 7.26 pct, in line with the
market at that time.
    But a European banker said pricing was not an issue IN the
present market conditionS, "the timing was just not right."
    "If banks had more patience they wouldn't launch any issues
now, and then the market would be all right," another dealer
said.
    "But there is no reason to be overly pessimistic," he said.
"The effect of this issue on the market should not be as bad as
what happened after the DKB and Morgan deals."
    Despite the criticism bankers said CDFC still managed to
recruit more than 10 underwriters though the composition of the
group has not yet been finalised.
    "Any trader should recommend his bank against joining the
deal," said a dealer. "But there are other considerations such as
relationship." He admitted his bank has joined as co-manager.
    A banker said he saw no reason why the market makers
decided to shut down if they were willing to join the new
issue.
    "Perhaps they were jealous that for the first time a Chinese
entity has taken the sole lead position for a Chinese issue," he
said.
    Previously Chinese entities have always acted as co-lead
managers, whether for Chinese or foreign issues.

billion yen of financing bills it holds to help absorb a
projected money market surplus, money market traders said.
    Of the total, 300 billion yen will yield 3.9989 pct on the
sales from money houses to banks and securities houses in
27-day repurchase agreement, due April 2.
    The remaining 200 billion yen will yield 3.9994 pct in a
39-day repurchase pact maturing on April 14, they said.
    The repurchase agreement yields compare with the 4.0625 pct
one-month commercial bill discount rate today and the 4.50/43
pct rate on one-month certificates of deposit.
    Tomorrow's surplus in the money market is estimated at 420
billion yen, mainly due to payment of national annuities, money
traders said. The operation will put the outstanding bill
supply at about 1,300 yen.

it needs an extension of deadlines for payment of capital and
interest on its 50 billion dlr foreign debt, Industry and
Foreign Trade Secretary Roberto Lavagna told reporters.
    "We, the developing countries, are going to insist on the
application of contingency clauses, to extend deadlines for the
payment of capital as well as interest," he said.
    He said this could bring about what he called a possible
automatic capitalisation of those parts of debt interest that
could not be paid and even the elimination of a portion of the
debt.

<TITLE>TANZANIAN RAILWAYS SECURE 25.6 MLN DLRS AID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DAR ES SALAAM, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>State-run Tanzania Railway
Corporation (TRC) has secured 25.6 mln dlrs aid from banks and
European countries for a one-year emergency repair program,
Transport Minister Mustafa Nyang'anyi said.
    Nyang'anyi told Reuters on his return from a World Bank
sponsored donors' conference in New York that the aid would
enable TRC to buy spares for 32 locomotives, overhaul 800
wagons and replace 67,000 sleepers over the next 12 months.
    The World Bank, African Development Bank, European
Community, Canada, Belgium, West Germany, Britain, Sweden,
Italy and Denmark had contributed to the package, he said.
    TRC runs a rail network linking Dar es Salaam and the
northern port of Tanga with the coffee-growing area around
Mount Kilimanjaro and ports on Lake Victoria and Lake
Tanganyika.
    It is under separate administration from the
Tanzania-Zambia railway linking Dar es Salaam with the Zambian
copperbelt and the railway system of southern Africa, which has
already received substantial aid as part of international
efforts to ease the dependence of landlocked African states on
trade routes through South Africa.
    But this is the first international aid package for TRC,
which also carries cargo for Uganda, Zaire and Burundi.

<TITLE>EARLY MARCH OPEC OUTPUT SEEN WELL BELOW CEILING</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Andrew Hill, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>OPEC crude oil output in the first few
days of March was running at about 14.7 mln bpd, down from a 16
mln bpd average for February and well below the 15.8 mln bpd
ceiling the group adopted in December, a Reuter survey shows.
    The figures were polled by Reuters correspondents from oil
traders, industry executives and analysts in Europe, the Middle
East, Africa, Latin America and Asia.
    They back recent statements by OPEC ministers that the
group is producing within its ceiling to support the return to
a fixed price system, which came into effect last month.
    OPEC output for the whole of February was about 200,000 bpd
above the ceiling, largely because of overproduction by the
United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, the figures show.
    The UAE, together with the much smaller producer Ecuador,
was also producing above quota in the first days of March, the
survey reveals.
    But such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fall
in Saudi Arabian output, together with Iran"s inability to
export as much as its quota allows.
    Iraq rejected its OPEC quota of 1.466 mln bpd and produced
1.75 mln bpd in February and early March, the figures showed.
    Saudi output -- excluding movements into stocks -- fell to
3.1 mln bpd in early March from 3.5 mln bpd in February,
against a 4.133 mln bpd quota. The Saudi figures include a
200,000 bpd share of Neutral Zone production.
    Kuwait, which has consistently denied quota violations, was
estimated to be pumping 1.4 mln bpd in February and 1.15 in
early March -- both figures including 200,000 bpd as its share
of Neutral Zone output -- against its 948,000 bpd quota.
    Reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by some
OPEC states were reflected in output from Qatar and Nigeria,
both substantially under quota in February and early March.
    Qatar's February output was 230,000 bpd, and this fell to
180,000 bpd in early March compared with its 285,000 bpd quota.
    Industry sources say Japanese buyers are resisting Qatar"s
prices and Gulf Arab oil states have pledged to make up for any
shortfall in sales which a fellow Gulf state suffers.
    Nigeria's early March output was about one mln bpd, down
from 1.14 mln bpd in February and its quota of 1.238 mln bpd.
    Industry sources say Nigeria's customers believe its Bonny
grades are overpriced compared with compatible Brent crudes
from the U.K. North Sea.
    Country-by-country production figures are as follows, in
mln bpd -

<TITLE>BAKER &lt;BKO> SUES TO FORCE HUGHES &lt;HT> MERGER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Baker International corp said it has
filed suit in state court in Houston to compel Hughes Tool Co
to complete its proposed merger with Baker.
    Late yesterday, Hughes said it had terminated the merger
agreement because Baker would not agree to an alternative
divestiture plan devised by Hughes.  Hughes' board had
previously found unacceptable a U.S. Justice Department consent
decree that would have required broader divestitures.
    Baker said it has not obtained any satisfactory explanation
from Hughes of its objections to the provisions of the Justice
Department consent decree.
    Hughes yesterday adjourned the special meeting at which
shareholders were to vote on the merger without permitting the
counting of votes on the deal.  Baker said it believes the vote
was overwhelmingly in favor of the merger.
    Baker said the new terms that Hughes proposed for the
merger, as an alternative to the consent decree, were "more
burdensome" than those of the consent decree themselves.
    Baker said divestitures under the consent decree would
reduce revenues for the combined company by about 65 mln dlrs
or three pct.
    Baker said it will continue to pursue the divestitures of
the units named in the consent decree.
    It said its suit names as defendants Hughes and certain of
its directors and seeks either an injunction forcing Hughes to
live up to the merger agreement or "substantial" monetary
damages it did not name.
    Baker said it believes the merger to be in the best
interests of shareholders of both companies.

<TITLE>SPAIN DEREGULATES BANK DEPOSIT INTEREST RATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MADRID, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Spain's Finance Ministry deregulated bank
deposit rates in an effort to raise competition among banks and
bring legislation into line with the European Community (EC), a
ministry spokesman said.
    The measure was published today in the Official State
Gazette. It takes effect tomorrow and lifts restrictions on
rates, now limited to six pct on deposits of up to 180 days.
    The government also enacted a decree cutting to one pct
from 13 pct the proportion of total assets which banks must
lend at favourable rates to industries classified "of public
interest."
    Some bankers expect the deregulation of rates to result in
a 20 pct drop in profits this year.
    Secretary of State for the Economy Guillermo de la Dehesa
told Reuters in a recent interview the reduction in fixed asset
investments would offset losses from the rate liberalisation.

<TITLE>USAIR &lt;U> REJECTS TWA &lt;TWA> TAKEOVER BID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>USAir Group Inc said its board has
rejected Trans World Airlines Inc's offer to acquire USAir for
52 dlrs per share in cash as grossly in adequate and not in the
best interests of USAir shareholders, employees or passengers.
    The company said the unsolicited bid by the Carl C.
Icahn-led TWA was "highly conditional."
    USAir said its board and that of Piedmont Aviation Inc
&lt;PIE> met separately yesterday to consider USAir's offer to
acquire 50.1 pct of Piedmont for 71 dlrs per share and
remaining shares for 1.5 to 1.9 common shares each, valued at
about 73 dlrs per share based on the average closing price of
USAir common during a period just before the merger.
    The company said it is continuing talks with Piedmont on
arriving at a definitive merger agreement and the two companies
hope to reach one very shortly.
    USAir said "In light of the highly conditional nature and
other terms of the TWA offer, the timing of the offer and the
circumstances under which it was made, USAir Group believes
that the purpose of the TWA offer is to interfere with USAir
Group's proposed acquisition of Piedmont.
    "TWA's proposal is nothing more than an attempt by Carl
Icahn to disrupt at the eleventh hour USAir Group's acquisition
of Piedmont, a transaction which the USAir Group board views as
most beneficial to USAir Group shareholders, employees and
passengers and which Mr. Icahn obviously regards as contrary to
his own personal interests."
    USAir said its board has authorized counsel to explore all
appropriate legal remedies against what it called TWA's
last-minute attempt to interfere with USAir Group's acquisition
of Piedmont.
    The company said conditions to the TWA offer include TWA
obtaining financing, the USAir board redeeming defensive rights
issued to shareholders last year and acting to render the "fair
price" provision contained in USAir's charter inapplicable to
the TWA offer and Transportation Department approval.

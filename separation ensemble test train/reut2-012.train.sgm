<TITLE>SHULTZ USSR TRIP FUELS TALK OF EEP WHEAT OFFER</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Nelson Graves, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Speculation the United States will
offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union appears to have
reached a new level of intensity in the run-up to Secretary of
State George Shultz' visit later this month to Moscow.
    Rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheat
markets since officials from the two countries held their
customary, semi-annual grain talks in February. Moscow's
decision at that time to reenter the U.S. corn market
strengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects.
    Shultz is set to arrive in Moscow April 13.
    Shultz' statement two weeks ago that he would not stand in
the way of a wheat subsidy offer under the Export Enhancement
Program, EEP, coupled with the announcement of his visit to
Moscow, was interpreted by many grain trade representatives
here as a clear signal that the Reagan administration was
preparing an offer.
    Administration officials -- in and out of the U.S.
Agriculture Department -- have been extremely tight-lipped
about the prospects of a subsidy offer.
    But USDA officials for the most part have abandoned the
contention the proposal is dormant, suggesting that an offer,
while not a "done deal," is a live possibility.
    Prominent U.S. grain trade representatives -- many of whom
asked not to be identified -- continue to maintain that an
offer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent.
    Others, who one month ago claimed a deal was not possible,
are saying they would not rule one out.
    Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., yesterday went so far as to
predict a subsidy offer would be made within the next ten days
to two weeks.
    Aides to Roberts said he had spoken to Republican leaders
who had been in contact with administration officials.
    Richard Fritz, director of international marketing at U.S.
Wheat Associates, said he was confident an export enhancement
offer would be made by the middle of this month.
    Fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would end
up being close to the offer Washington made Peking earlier this
year when USDA approved subsidies to China of around 36 dlrs
per tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat.
    Some grain trade representatives say a four-mln-tonne wheat
subsidy offer might help stimulate more Soviet purchases of
U.S. corn and open the door to U.S. sales of soybeans.
    As ever, one of the crucial sticking points in a wheat deal
would appear to be price.
    Last summer the administration took the controversial step
of offering the Soviets subsidized wheat -- but were
embarrassed when Moscow spurned the proposal on the grounds
that the 15-dlr-per-tonne subsidy still left U.S. wheat prices
far above world market prices.
    The administration's decision to set the subsidy level up
front instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be a
means of controlling the price while attempting to dampen
criticism, grain trade sources said.
    Nonetheless, the pricing procedure did not prevent Shultz
from saying the Soviets were "chortling" because Washington was
offering Soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available to
U.S. housewives.
    The conventional wisdom among grain trade representatives
here is that a general warming of relations between the two
countries since last summer, combined with continued hard times
in the U.S. grain belt, would favor a subsidy offer.
    In addition, the USSR has made it clear it would consider
buying U.S. wheat if it were priced more competitively.
    However, observers have not forgotten the circumstances
surrounding the administration's announcement of the wheat
subsidy offer last summer.
    Up until the time of the announcment, congressional and
industry leaders were led to believe the White House had
decided to expand the Export Enhancement Program to include not
only the Soviets, but also a much broader list of countries.
    Instead, the administration scaled back the offer to
include only the Soviets.
    That last-minute change of heart adds a measure of
uncertainty even to the predictions of those most convinced
that the administration will not now pass up the opportunity to
sell four mln tonnes of wheat to the Soviet Union.

<TITLE>ICO QUOTAS BEFORE OCTOBER UNLIKELY - DELEGATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The restoration of coffee export quotas
before the end of the current 1986/87 coffee year (Oct 1/Sept
30) now seems unlikely, given reluctance by International
Coffee Organization, ICO, producers and consumers to resume
negotiations on an interim quota accord, producer delegates
told reporters.
    Consumers and most producers see no point in reopening the
quota dialogue while Brazil's position remains unchanged, they
said.
    Brazil's refusal to accept a reduction in its previous 30
pct share of the ICO's global export quota effectively
torpedoed talks here last month aimed at restoring quotas
before October, the delegates noted.
    Disappointment at the lack of progress on quotas forced
coffee futures in London and New York to new lows today,
traders here said. Near May in New York fell below one dlr in
early trading at around 99.10 cents per pound, traders said.
    Producer delegates said that while the possibility of
reimposing quotas before October remained on the ICO agenda, in
practice the idea had effectively been discarded.
    The ICO's executive board session here this week has so far
barely touched on the quota debate, demonstrating general
unwillingness to revive talks while chances of success are
still remote, producer delegates said.
    Some producers are in no hurry to see quotas restored,
despite the price collapse seen since the failure of last
month's negotiations, they said.
    "With Brazil's frost season approaching, who wants to
negotiate quotas," one leading producer delegate said.
    Coffee prices normally rise during Brazil's frost season
(mainly June-August) as dealers and roasters build up stocks as
insurance against possible severe frost damage to Brazil's
crop.
    Many producers are more interested in working towards
reimposing quotas from October 1, based on a new system of
quota allocations valid until the International Coffee
Agreement expires in 1989, they said.
    Guatemala has already proposed the "other oilds" producer
group should meet in the next two months to begin talks on how
to allocate quota shares.
    Producers still seem divided on how to overhaul the quota
distribution system, with some producer delegates reporting
growing support for a radical reallocation, based on the
principle of "objective criteria" favoured by consumers.
    At last month's council session a splinter group of small
producers backed consumer demands for new quota shares based on
exportable production and stocks, while Brazil, Colombia and
the rest of the producers favoured leaving quota allocations
unchanged, except for some temporary adjustments.
    A delegate from one of the eight said more producers now
supported their cause.
    The delegate said unless major producers like Brazil showed
readiness to negotiate new quota shares, prospects for a quota
accord in October also looked bleak.
    The U.S. and most other consumers are still determined to
make reimposition of quotas conditional on a redistribution of
quota shares based on "objective criteria."
    ICO observers remained sceptical that Brazil would be
prepared to accept a quota reduction when the ICO council meets
in September.
    Brazil has adopted a tough stance with banks on external
debt negotiations and is likely to be just as tough on coffee,
they said.
    They said Brazil's reluctance to open coffee export
registrations might reflect fears this would provoke another
price slide and force an emergency ICO council session, which
would most likely end in failure.
    Producers met this afternoon to review the market situation
but had only a general discussion about how further
negotiations should proceed, a producer delegate said.
    Producers plan to hold consultations on quotas, and then
may set a date for a formal producer meeting, but plans are not
fixed, he said.
    The ICO executive board reconvened at 1650 hours local time
to hear a report from consultants on ICO operations. The board
meeting looks set to end today, a day earlier than scheduled,
delegates said.

<TITLE>NEW MONTREAL NEWSPAPER FOLDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Le Matin, the French-language tabloid
launched here in February, said it is shutting down its
operations because it can no longer get financing.
    The paper, launched by private investors, was Montreal's
fourth French-language newspaper and was aimed at readers with
above average incomes and educations. It had a daily
circulation of about 20,000 copies.
    Le Matin was printed and distributed by (Southam Inc)'s
Montreal Gazette newspaper. A Gazette spokesman said his
newspaper is Le Matin's biggest creditor but he declined to
reveal the amount of debt
    Acting publisher Jean-Pierre Bordua said the newspaper's
bank blocked its lines of credit after three of the paper's
senior managers resigned Friday.

<TITLE>TOWLE &lt;QTOW> STOCK MAY BE DILUTED, CANCELED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOSTON, Mass., April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Towle Manufacturing Co, in Chapter
11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code, said any plan of reorganization
would likely lead to a dilution or cancellation of its common
and preferred stock.
    The company also said claims for subordinated debentures
would likely be paid at less than their 100 pct of their face
value, and general unsecured claims would likely be paid
without interest. The company has not yet filed a plan of
reorganization.
    The company said it lost 22 mln dlrs from operations in
1986 against a loss of 67.2 mln dlrs a year ago.
    The company also said its independent accountants
disclaimed an opinion on the financial statements for 1986
because of questions about its contination as a going concern.
    The company said, however, it substantially restructured
its business, reducing borrowings on an outstanding credit line
to 16.5 mln dlrs in 1986 from 57 mln dlrs a year ago. The
company also cut its staff to 820 employees at the end of 1986
from 2,500 a year earlier.

<TITLE>TOSHIBA COULD BE FIRST TO FEEL U.K. TRADE ANGER</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Sten Stovall, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T>, the Japanese
electronics group which plans to enter Britain's liberalised
telecommunications equipment market, risks becoming the first
casualty in the current war of words over trade between Japan
and the U.K., Government and industry sources said.
    U.K. Authorities have lost patience with Japanese trading
practices and said they are seeking ways to retaliate without
unleashing a damaging trade war. "Toshiba's timing seems most
unfortunate for the company, as it comes exactly when we are
looking for someone to punch," one official told Reuters.
    Earlier, &lt;Toshiba Information Systems (U.K.) Ltd> said it
wanted to enter the British business facsimile and key
telephone market. A facsimile machine sends printed data over
telephone lines, while a key telephone system is used for
switching calls within a business, industry sources said.
    The move by Toshiba comes in the middle of a dispute over
Japan's refusal to open up its telecommunications market to
foreign companies. "Toshiba's timing is most extraordinary," one
official at the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) said.
    Tomorrow, the U.K. Government will consider what legal
action it can possible take to press for Japanese reform.
    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has given notice that the
U.K. Would fight the Japanese government's attempt to prevent
Cable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L> from taking a significant
position in a new Japanese international telecommunications
venture. "We regard this as a test case," she told Parliament.
    But while the U.K. Is keen to see some movement on the
issue by Japan, it is also worried that recent anti-Japanese
rhetoric may cause developments to get out of hand, officials
said.
    Japanese officials in Tokyo today reiterated that Japan had
no plans to bow to U.K. And U.S. Pressure to give foreign
telecommunications firms a bigger role there.
    The government, for which competition and the deregulation
of markets are major political themes, is unlikely to make
final decisions tomorrow on how to act against Japan, officials
said.
    Detailed consideration of the issue has been shelved during
Thatcher's official visit to the Soviet Union, which ends
today.
    "We are waiting for the Prime Minister to decide what to do.
The DTI will pass the ball to her as soon as she returns
tonight," a DTI official said.
    He said Toshiba's application would be considered by the
Office of Telecommunications (OFTEL). An OFTEL spokeswoman said
"a decision on this application will take weeks, maybe months."
    Asked whether Toshiba's bid would fall victim to British
retaliation, the OFTEL spokeswoman said: "Who knows what's going
to happen given the current situation!"
    A Toshiba executive, who asked not to be named, told
Reuters: "We do not anticipate any special problems."
    Some analysts queried by Reuters questioned the basis of
Britain's strong stand on the Cable and Wireless bid. One said
that the company's proposal was equivalent to a Japanese
company wanting to take a stake in Mercury International, the
subsidiary of Cable and Wireless that is the only real
competitor of British Telecommunications Plc &lt;BTY.L>.
    British Corporate Affairs minister Michael Howard leaves
for Japan on Saturday.
    The minister will seek a clear timetable from Japan for
easier access for British institutions to Japanese financial
markets, reciprocating the easy access Japanese securities
houses and banks have to the City of London.
    Britain has threatened to use its new Financial Services
Act to revoke or deny licences to Japanese brokerage houses if
it does not get satisfaction.
    But British authorities would be far from happy if forced
to use that weapon, government sources said.
    Sir Nicholas Goodison, Chairman of the London Stock
Exchange, said in New York yesterday that sanctions against
Japanese financial institutions operating in the U.K. Would set
back London's ambition to become a leading centre for corporate
financing and securities trading.
    Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson also warned
yesterday of the negative effects that a trade war could have
on the British economy. Such a development could hit U.K.
Exports and sharply alter the outlook for the next general
election in which economic recovery will be one of the
government's main themes, political analysts said.

<TITLE>DOLLAR EUROBONDS END EASIER ON PRIME RATE RISES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Christopher Pizzey, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The dollar straight sector of the
eurobond market ended easier after a subdued day's trading as
U.S. Banks began to match yesterday's surprise 1/4 point prime
rate hikes by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank, dealers said.
    The prime rates were raised to 7-3/4 from 7-1/2 pct and the
timing of the moves puzzled many dealers. However, reaction
here was limited, with shorter dated paper ending steady to 1/4
point easier, while longer dates dipped by 1/4 to 1/2 point.
    In the primary market, activity again centred on currencies
other than the U.S. Dollar, dealers noted.
    One dollar straight dealer at a U.S. Securities house
commented "There was, in fact, the odd retail buyer today, but
only in small sizes." He added that, ironically, the prime rate
rises may help the market to stabilise since the dollar rose on
the back of the news.
    The only U.S. Dollar deal launched during the day was, as
has been the case recently, equity linked. The 15-year
convertible bond was for the Bank of Tokyo Ltd and has an
indicated coupon of two pct. One source at a house involved in
the deal said, "It's got to be a blow-out. With a name like this
you're talking about Japan Inc."
    The lead manager was the Bank of Tokyo International (BOTI)
and the deal ended far above the par issue price at 108 109
pct. A BOTI official said "We've had worldwide interest in the
deal."
    She noted the Tokyo stock market had experienced a mild
correction at the beginning of the week but that bank stocks
were hardly affected.
    The yen sector edged slightly firmer and one new straight
deal was launched, a 20 billion yen bond for France's Caisse
Nationale des Telecommunications. The state guaranteed five
year bond pays 4-3/8 pct and was priced at 101-1/2 pct.
    The issue was lead managed by IBJ International Ltd and was
quoted on the grey market at less 1-7/8 less 1-3/4 pct compared
with the total fees of 1-7/8 pct. One syndicate official at a
firm not involved in the deal said "It's tight, but overall I
would say its fairly priced."
    Also launched was a five-year zero coupon bond with a total
redemption amount of 19 billion yen for Rural Banking and
Finance Corp of New Zealand. It was priced at 81.22 pct and
lead managed by Nomura International.
    In the Australian dollar sector, GMAC (Australia) Finance
Ltd issued a 50 mln Australian dlr bond.
    Hambros Bank Ltd was lead manager for the four-year deal
which pays 14-1/4 pct and was priced at 101 pct. It was
guranteed by General Motors Acceptance Corp and was quoted on
the 1-3/4 pct fees at less 1-3/4 pct bid.
    McDonalds Corp issued a 75 mln Canadian dlr bond paying
8-1/2 pct over five years and priced at 101-5/8 pct. It was
quoted around the 1-7/8 pct fees at less two less 1-3/4 and was
led by Morgan Guaranty Ltd.
    The European Investment Bank launched a 300 mln Danish
Crown, seven-year, bond withan 11 pct coupon and pricing of 101
pct. It was lead managed by Den Danske Bank.
    The floating rate note sector basically ended easier
following the increase in period eurodollar deposit rates
prompted by the prime rate increases, dealers said. But they
noted that mis-match deals - issues whereby the coupon is
re-fixed on a monthly basis - were firmer.

said its board approved a modernization and expansion program
from its petrochemical division, USI Chemical Co, its
polyethylene producer.
    The program will add 600 mln pounds per year to USI's
existing capacity of 3.2 billion pounds, the company said. The
increase will result from the addition of two linear reactors
based on fluid bed gas phase technology for the production of
linear low density or high density polyethylene at locations in
the Midwest and Gulf Coast, it said.
    Plans are in the engineering stage with completion expected
in mid 1989, the company said. In addition, USI is presently
constructing a 300 mln pound linear low density polyethylene
facility, scheduled to come on stream in early 1988 at its Port
Author, Texas, plant.

<TITLE>TOSHIBA COULD BE FIRST TO FEEL U.K. TRADE ANGER</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Sten Stovall, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T>, the Japanese
electronics group which plans to enter Britain's liberalised
telecommunications equipment market, risks becoming the first
casualty in the current war of words over trade between Japan
and the U.K., Government and industry sources said.
    U.K. Authorities have lost patience with Japanese trading
practices and said they are seeking ways to retaliate without
unleashing a damaging trade war. "Toshiba's timing seems most
unfortunate for the company, as it comes exactly when we are
looking for someone to punch," one official told Reuters.
    Earlier, &lt;Toshiba Information Systems (U.K.) Ltd> said it
wanted to enter the British business facsimile and key
telephone market. A facsimile machine sends printed data over
telephone lines, while a key telephone system is used for
switching calls within a business, industry sources said.
    The move by Toshiba comes in the middle of a dispute over
Japan's refusal to open up its telecommunications market to
foreign companies. "Toshiba's timing is most extraordinary," one
official at the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) said.
    Tommorrow, the U.K. Government will consider what legal
action it can possible take to press for Japanese reform.
    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has given notice that the
U.K. Would fight the Japanese government's attempt to prevent
Cable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L> from taking a significant
position in a new Japanese international telecommunications
venture. "We regard this as a test case," she told Parliament.
    But while the U.K. Is keen to see some movement on the
issue by Japan, it is also worried that recent anti-Japanese
rhetoric may cause developments to get out of hand, officials
said.
    Japanese officials in Tokyo today reiterated that Japan had
no plans to bow to U.K. And U.S. Pressure to give foreign
telecommunications firms a bigger role there.

<TITLE>DIAMOND SHAMROCK &lt;DIA> SEES BETTER 1987 EARNINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, APRIL 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Diamond Shamrock Corp, which will split
this month into two separate companies, expects to show
improved earnings in 1987 over last year, executives of the new
company told Reuters.
    Charles Blackburn, president and chief executive officer of
Diamond Shamrock and the new company, which will emphasize
exploration and production, said, "Earnings wil be better than
in 1986." He declined to say how much better.
    In 1986 Diamond Shamrock reported a loss of 115.6 mln dlrs
on total revenues of 2.543 billion dlrs. Exploration and
production lost 18.5 mln dlrs on revenues of 593.5 mln dlrs.
    Roger Hemminghaus, Diamond Shamrock vice president and
soon-to-be chief executive of the spin-off Diamond Shamrock
Refining and Marketing Co, said, "Refining and marketing is a
margin business. The margins will return and this will be a
better year than 1986."
    In 1986, refining and marketing showed operating profits of
40.1 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.636 billion dlrs.
    "We are also expecting to be in the black in the first
quarter (1987)," Heminghaus added. In the first quarter of 1986,
the refining and marketing segment showed a loss of 27.1 mln
dlrs on revenues of 492.1 mln dlrs.
   
    The executives were in New york for meetings with
institutional investors aimed at increasing interest in the
company's stock.
    On the New York Stock Exchange, Diamond Shamrock was
trading at 16-1/4, down 1/4.
    Earlier this year, T. Boone Pickens offered 15 dlrs a share
for Diamond Shamrock, and management countered with an offer at
17 dlrs and a decision to split off the refining and marketing
operation to its shareholders.
    "Our advisors convinced us the market would give higher
multiples for pure plays," Blackburn said.

sharply after analyst Eugene Nowak of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc
raised his earnings estmates of the company, traders said.
    ARCO jumped 1-3/4 to 81-3/4.
    Nowak said that based on an average oil price of 17 dlrs a
barrel in 1987, the company should earn about 4.50 dlrs a
share. Next year, based on an average oil price of 18 dlrs a
barrel, ARCO should earn about five dlrs a share. The company
earned 3.38 dlrs a share in 1986. "If oil prices should rise to
an average of 20 dlrs a barrel," he said, "ARCO could record
earnings of 6.50 dlrs a share.
    Nowak said his increased estimates come after the company
told analysts yesterday that its first quarter earnings will
comfortably cover its quarterly dividend requirement of one dlr
a share.
    Nowak said, "The company has done an outstanding job
reducing expenses, and ARCO is poised to generate greater
earnings power." He said first quarter earnings will likely
exceed the company's expectations stated yesterday and be in
the 1.15-1.20 dlr-a-share range.

<TITLE>U.S. SAID PROMISED BULK OF MAIZE EXPORT TO SPAIN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Has been promised a near
monopoly of maize exports to Spain from third countries
guaranteed under an agreement with the European Community, an
EC official said.
    The official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters that
the guarantee was given in an unpublished clause of the
agreement.
    Under the accord, which began in January, third countries
were guaranteed access for the next four years for two mln
tonnes a year of maize to the Spanish market, as well as
300,000 tonnes of sorghum.
    However, the official said the U.S. Had been assured that
almost all the exports would be reserved for its traders.
    The EC Commission is to ask member states to agree either a
tender system to fix reduced import levies for the maize or to
authorise direct imports by the Spanish intervention board.
    EC sources noted that under a tender system maize from
outside the U.S. Would sometimes be offered on more favourable
terms than that from the U.S.
    No Commission spokesman was immediately available for
comment.

<TITLE>ALASKA HOUSING FINANCE GETS CREDIT, EURO-CP PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Alaska Housing Finance Corp signed a 150
mln dlr revolving credit facility and a 150 mln dlr
euro-commercial paper program, Merrill Lynch Capital Markets
said.
    The borrower is a state backed, public corporation which
provides 70 to 85 pct of the single-family residential
mortgages in Alaska. It is the first U.S. Municipality to
arrange these types of facilities in the international capital
markets.
    The seven-year revolving credit has a commitment fee of
0.10 pct per annum, under which drawings will be at 5/16 pct
over the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor).
    The facility also incorporates a swing-line facility, which
would allow for same day drawings in the U.S. Market for up to
three business days at the floating U.S. Prime rate. Credit
Lyonnais is acting as coordinator for this facility.
    Merrill Lynch is agent for the revolving facility, which
was lead managed by Swiss Bank Corporation (San Francisco
branch).
    The facility will allow the borrower to issue direct
unsecured advances in U.S. Dlrs with maturities of up to six
months. It also will be able to issue on an uncommitted basis
euronotes with maturities of up to six months, which will be
priced under the issuer-set margin system.
    Although Alaska Housing Finance will set the interest rates
relative to Libor for the euronotes, Merrill Lynch noted that
it would not seek to issue the notes with a margin in excess of
0.2125 pct per annum.
    The euro-commercial paper program allows for the issuance
of notes with maturities of up to 183 days. Merrill was the
arranger for that program and will act as one of the dealers
along with Salomon Brothers International Ltd and Swiss Bank
Corporation International Ltd.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Institute of International Finance
Managing Director Horst Schulmann said that his orgnaization
has been forecasting further declines of interest rates in the
first half this year and then a levelling off and there is no
reason to change that.
    Speaking to reporters, the bank research group said that
the increase in interest rates announced yesterday and other
activity in the foreign exchange markets did not indicate a
fundamental change in the outlook.
    Schulmann, speaking broadly about the global debt problem,
said that the International Monetary Fund should increase its
assistance to third world countries.
    The remarks come just before next week's meeting of the
IMF's Interim Committee and the Joint Development Committee of
the IMF and World Bank.
    In a letter to the committee's, the bank group said,
"Commercial banks cannot be the dominant supplier of balance of
payments finance."
    Schulmann said that IMF exposure peaked in 1985 and has
declined a bit since then.

lowered 128 mln dlrs of Brown Group Inc's senior debt to
A-minus from A and commercial paper to A-2 from A-1.
    The agency said a decline in sales and profits were little
offset from the company's retail business. Also, foreign
producers eroded Brown's assets by gaining market share.
    Brown's debt ratio increased to 49.8 pct by year-end 1986
as higher inventories, and a four-year stock repurchase program
has required additional financing, S and P said.
    Restructuring efforts should improve productivity but not
in the forseeable future, the agency added.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>J.C. PEnney Co Inc said it signed a
letter of intent to acquire one mln shares, or a 20 pct equity
interest, of Beeba's Creations Inc &lt;BEBA> for 18.75 dlrs a
share.
    Penney said the agreement also calls for Beeba's, a major
supplier of junior sportswear, to work with Penny in the
establishment of junior specialty shops to be created in about
100 Penney stores in early 1988.
    Freestanding stores are also being planned, the company
said. Beeba's will be the principal source of merchandise to
the shops, it said.
    For the six months ended February 28, Beeba's reported net
income of 1.2 mln dlrs on sales of 39.4 mln dlrs.
    Penney said it will establish an independent merchandising
and marketing organization to manage and support the shops
which will be staffed by personnel both from within and outside
the company.
    The company said the new agreement would have no impact on
its current supplier base and it will continue to work with as
braod base of suppliers of junior sportswear as it does in its
other merchandise areas.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>AUSTRIAN BANKS DIVIDED OVER INTEREST RATE CUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    VIENNA, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Calls for a cut in Austrian interest
rates have grown in recent days but bank chiefs are divided
over the issue.
    Karl Vak, General Director of the Zentralsparkasse und
Kommerzialbank, Wien, called today for a cut of up to half a
percentage point in interest rates across the board. But Hannes
Androsch, head of Creditanstalt-Bankverein &lt;CABV.VI> told
Reuters he opposed a cut because it would hurt small savers.
    Vak told a news conference that last January's cut in
lending rates for commercial customers and for all depositors
by a quarter point had been insufficient.
    The January cut followed the National Bank's lowering of
its discount and Lombard rates by half a point in line with a
similar Bundesbank move. Prime lending rate is now 8.75 pct and
deposit rates vary between 3.25 and 5.75 pct.
    Yesterday Hellmuth Klauhs, head of the Genossenschaftliche
Zentralbank AG, said rates could fall at least a quarter of a
point, or even half a point if German rates dropped further.
    Vak noted that inflation had fallen below one pct. A
widening gap between Austrian rates and cheaper West German
credit along with forecasts of slow Austrian economic growth
this year also justified a further interest drop, he said.
    Karl Pale, head of Girozentrale und Bank der
oesterreichischen Sparkassen AG [GIRV.VI] has also called for
lower deposit rates but said lending rates should remain
unchanged at the moment. Interest margins were too small,
particularly when compared with other West European countries.
    But Hans Haumer, head of the Erste Oesterreichische
Spar-Casse-Bank told Reuters that no cut should be made unless
West German rates came down first.
    Banking sources said no bank seemed ready to lower rates
alone and supporters of a cut would have difficulty overcoming
opposition from Creditanstalt, Austria's biggest bank.

    S and P cited its new policy on rating secured airline debt

the unit's underlying credit strength.
    The certificates and 225.9 mln dlrs of CC subordinated debt
remain on S/P creditwatch with positive implications. Eastern

<TITLE>WEATHERFORD INT'L &lt;WII> GETS DEBT AGREEMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Weatherford International Inc said it
reached an agreement to restructure about 41 mln dlrs of debt
held by bank and insurance company lenders.
    Under the agreement, the oil drilling equipment and oil
services company will pay reduced quarterly interest payments
on part of its bank revolving credit loans and industrial
revenue bonds. Remaining interest will be deferred until Jan 1,
1991.
    Principal payments will be deferred, with semi-annual
payments of 1.75 mln dlrs to start on Dec 31, 1989 and all
remaining principal due Jan 1, 1991.
    Additional interest and principal payments may be due on
the bank revolving credit lines if the company generates more
cash than it needs for operations.
    Term of the debt held by insurance company lenders will be
extended by one year until December 1990 by reducing the
principal due last year and this year. Otherwise, interest and
principal payments will continue to be made as scheduled in the
existing agreements.
    The proposed restructuring will reduce Weatherford's cash
requirements by about three mln dlrs in 1987 and 2.5 mln dlrs
in 1988, it said.
    The company, which is still in default, said it expects to
completed amended loan agreements during the next few months.
    The company also said the recently announced sale of a
non-core production equipment unit and a Mexican subsidiary
will not have a material impact on future revenues and will
eliminate exposure to future losses.
    It has consolidated other U.S. and foreign manufacturing
operations to reduce costs and written down certain inventories
to better reflect their value, it added.

the administration backs the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance
Corp (FSLIC) recapitalization bill approved by the House
Banking Committee and opposes the Senate-passed version.
    Baker told a House Appropriations Subcommittee the 15
billion dlr recapitalization plan approved by the House panel
was sufficient while the 7.5 billion dlr plan in the
Senate-passed bill was "inadequate."
    He also urged the House to reject loophole-closing
provisions in the Senate bill that would restrict banking
activities.

<TITLE>LAWSON WANTS STERLING AROUND 1.60 DLRS, 2.90 MKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson said he wanted sterling to stay roughly where it was,
specifying a rate of around 2.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs.
    He told the National Economic Development Council that the
recent Paris meeting of major industrialised nations had agreed
on the need for exchange rate stability. There was now a
"reasonable alignment of currencies" and the U.K. Government
intended to keep sterling at about its present level, he said.
    That meant around 2.90 marks, which is the single most
important rate to concentrate on, and 1.60 dlrs, Lawson said.
    His disclosure of two of the key targets for sterling was
highly unusual, foreign exchange market analysts said.
    In the past he has preferred to be less definite about the
Government's exchange rate policy, lest it give foreign
exchange markets set limits to test.
    Lawson told the committee, which is a tripartite forum of
government, unions and industry, that the pound would be kept
near its present level by a mixture of interest rates and
intervention in the foreign exchange markets.
    The pound finished trading here today at 1.6040/50 dlrs and
2.9210/45 marks.

<DATELINE>    CARACAS, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The new interest rate of 7/8 pct over
Libor on Venezuelan public sector debt payments goes into
effect today, Finance Minister Manuel Azpurua said .
    Azpurua told reporters yesterday the reduction from the
previous margin of 1-1/8 pct above Libor will save the country
some 50 mln dollars in debt servicing.
    The new rate is among changes agreed last month to the 20.3
billion dlr public sector debt rescheduling. Under the new
agreement, Venezula was also able to extend the term from 12 to
14 years and to lower debt payments in the 1987-89 period by 64
pct.
    Azpurua said that according to the agreement, the new
interest rate will be retroactive to April 1, provided the
accord is approved before October 1.
    He told reporters the term sheet detailing the changes in
the rescheduling has already been endorsed by the 13-member
debt steering committee and is now being sent to the country's
460 creditor banks for their approval.
    The new agreement replaces a rescheduling accord signed in
February 1986, which Venezuela asked to revise to reflect a 45
pct drop in oil revenues.

<TITLE>HORN/HARDART &lt;HOR> UNIT DISPOSES 33 RESTAURANTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     LAS VEGAS, Nev., April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Horn and Hardart Co said it
disposed of 33 Bojangles' Chicken 'N Biscuits restaurants in
Florida as part of its previously announced retrenchment of its
Bojangles' subsidiary.
    Terms were not disclosed.
    The company said the restaurants in Orlando, Tampa and
Jacksonville markets have incurred the majority of Bojangles'
operating losses over the last two years.
    Due to the transaction, Horn and Hardart is projecting a
positive cash flow for the unit for the remainder of fiscal
1987.
    A spokesman said the disposition consists of a combination
of sale, lease and re-franchise agreements.
    The transaction involves one-quarter of the company-owned
Bojangles' restaurants and is in accordance with its
restructuring program announced in October 1986.
    A spokesman said the company is considering the sale or
spinoff of the 91-company owned additional restaurants, which
are profitable.
    The company said the disposition will result in no profit
or loss for the company because the costs were anticipated in a
34-mln-dlr reserve taken in the third quarter of 1986.
    The foodservice division, which includes Burger King,
Arby's and Tony Roma's, had a pre-tax operating loss of 29.6
mln dlrs in 1986, including the 34.0 mln dlr charge to
restructure Bojangles. Excluding Bojangles', the group had
revenues of 43.8 mln dlrs.
    The company said that, pursuant to the restructuring, it
has cut general and administrative expenses attributable to
Bojangle' by 35 pct.

<TITLE>NIAGARA MOHAWK &lt;NMK> DEBT DOWNGRADED BY MOODY'S</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Moody's Investors Service Inc said it
downgraded Niagara Mohawk Power Corp's 2.2 billion dlrs of debt
securities and preferred stock.
    Moody's cited cost increases at the utility's Nine Mile
Nuclear Unit 2 and an unfavorable rate decision by the New York
Public Service Commission.
    Cut were the company's first mortgage bonds and secured
pollution control issues to Baa-2 from Baa-1, and Eurobonds,
unsecured pollution control debt, unsecured medium-term notes
and preferred stock to Baa-3 from Baa-2. Niagara Mohawk's
Prime-2 commercial paper was left unchanged.
    Moody's said the rate decision last month by the Public
Service Commission would significantly pressure Niagara
Mohawk's coverage of fixed charges.
    Moreover, cost increases associated with the in-service
delay of the 41 pct owned Nine Mile Unit 2 from September 1987
to early 1988, along with prospective delays, are unlikely to
be recovered under the cost-settlement agreement for the
nuclear unit, Moody's noted.
    The potential write-off would sharply reduce Niagara
Mohawk's common equity and may impair financial flexibility,
the agency said.

<TITLE>BRITISH SUGAR SOWINGS OFF TO SLOW START</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Drilling of this year's British sugar
beet crop got off to a slow start due to poor weather
conditions with only around one pct sown so far, a spokesman
for British Sugar Plc said.
    This compares with two pct at the same stage last year,
three pct in 1985 and 38 to 39 pct in 1984.
    There is little cause for concern with better weather
forecast and the capacity available to drill the contracted
area of around 200,000 hectares in about 10 days. Seed beds
look good and farmers are advised to wait for soil temperatures
to rise, the spokesman said.
    "If the crop can be drilled by the third week in April we
will be delighted," he said. Last year a large proportion of the
crop was not drilled until May but it still turned out to be
the equal second largest on record.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>CURRENCY INTERVENTION TIMING CRUCIAL - ANALYSTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The dollar's recent decline, despite
massive central bank purchases, is a forceful reminder that
official intervention in the foreign exchanges can work only if
it is well-timed to coincide with shifts in market fundamentals
or sentiment, dealers and analysts said.
    Central banks may succeed in slowing a trend, but, without
accompanying policy changes, they stand little chance of
reversing the direction of an ever-growing global market in
which more than 200 billion dlrs is traded every day, the
sources said.
    "Timing and psychology are the key to successful
intervention," said Jim O'Neill, a financial markets economist
with Marine Midland Banks Inc. The importance of complementary
changes in economic fundamentals was underlined yesterday when
a change in interest rates boosted the dollar, instantly
achieving what the central banks had tried in vain to do for a
week through open market intervention.
    After Citibank raised its prime rate by a quarter-point to
7-3/4 pct, the first change in the rate since last August, the
dollar started to advance and reached a high in Tokyo of 147.50
yen, up two yen from Tuesday's New York low.
    By contrast, monetary authorities spearheaded by the Bank
of Japan are estimated to have bought as much as 10 billion
dlrs in the last 10 days of March but could not prevent the
dollar from skidding through 150 yen and plumbing a 40-year low
Monday of 144.70 yen. Some experts worry the central banks have
lost more than just a temporary battle to prop up the dollar.
The market is wary of being caught wrong-footed by a central
bank foray, but is no longer mesmerized.
    "They've lost their credibility. The market feels it can
take on the central banks and win," said Michael Snow, head of
treasury operations at Union Bank of Switzerland in New York.
    The relative failure of recent intervention stands in sharp
contrast to the success that central banks scored when they
joined forces to drive the dollar down following the September
22, 1985, Plaza accord.
    Then, however, central banks had an easy time of it,
because the markets and the Treasuries of the major industrial
powers were agreed that the dollar needed to head lower to
redress massive worldwide trade imbalances.
    Now, there is no such consensus. The market is saying that
the dollar must fall further because the U.S. trade deficit is
showing little sign of improvement, while Japan is resisting in
a bid to protect its export industries.
    For its part, the United States is apparently content to
let the dollar fall gradually further and is paying little more
than lip service to the February Paris agreement of the Group
of Five plus Canada to foster stability, dealers say.
    Specifically, they said the Fed's dollar-buying
intervention has been half-hearted, designed more as a
political gesture to Japan than to strike fear into the
markets. "It's been pro-forma intervention," said Francoise
Soares-Kemp, chief corporate trader at Credit Lyonnais.
    Because of this discord and the market's momentum for a
lower dollar, analysts said intervention looks doomed to fail.
    "It's going to take a lot more than the central banks to
hold the dollar (at these levels)," said Snow, who predicts
another 10 to 15 pct depreciation.
    "There have to be structural changes that occur to make the
market stop selling dollars," added "Buying six billion dollars
in three weeks is not going to do it."
    Late last decade during the presidency of Jimmy Carter,
when the dollar was last under heavy speculative attack,
central banks sometimes intervened to the tune of six billion
dlrs in a single day but still failed to stop the dollar
falling to a record low of 1.70 marks, analysts said.
    Snow said purchases on that scale now are unlikely. "I
don't think anybody has the stomach for it, because they saw
the futility of it in the seventies."
    Indeed, because the market has grown in leaps and bound
since then, intervention on an even greater scale would
probably be needed to impress the market.
    Trading volume in London, New York and Tokyo alone last
year averaged nearly 188 billion dlrs a day, according to a
joint central bank study, about double the previous estimate
made just two years earlier by the Group of Thirty private
research group.
    There are signs that central banks, too, realize the
futility of swimming against the tide.
    Bank of Japan sources told Reuters in Tokyo earlier this
week that they believed the limits of currency market
intervention are perhaps being reached and that other methods
for bolstering the dollar, such as invoking currency swap
agreements with other central banks, are being considered.
    "In this era of financial liberalization, it's almost
impossible to control the flow of capital in and out of Japan,"
one senior official in Tokyo said.

<TITLE>CANADIAN TIRE MAJOR HOLDERS NOT EXTENDING PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>CTC Dealer Holdings Ltd said &lt;Canadian
Tire Corp Ltd> controlling shareholders Alfred, David and
Martha Billes did not extend an agreement expiring yesterday to
tender their shares only to CTC's previously reported offer for
49 pct of Canadian Tire common shares.
    CTC, which already holds 17.4 pct of Canadian Tire common,
said it would therefore not take up any shares tendered under
its offer unless they totaled at least 1.1 mln or another 32.7
pct of Canadian Tire common. The Billes control 60 pct of
Canadian Tire common. It added that it extended its offer to
May 11 at a fixed price of 165.36 dlrs a share.
    CTC, a group of Canadian Tire dealers, said it expected to
know by May 11 if it would obtain approval to appeal a
previously reported Ontario court ruling upholding a regulatory
decision to block CTC's offer.
    The dealers' bid was previously blocked by the Ontario
Securities Commission because the offer excluded holders of
Canadian Tire class A non-voting shares, which make up about 96
pct of company equity.

River Constructors, a joint venture with Martin Eby and a
subsidiary of Hunt Corp, has received a 517-mln-dlr
construction contract from the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers.
    The work includes the construction of more than 70
buildings and associated infrastructure to accommodate the
Army's new 10th Mountain Division.
    In a press release, Rep. David O'B. Martin, N.Y., said the
awarding of the contract is subject to Congressional review.
Morrison-Knudsen said the contract represents the largest Army
construction in this country since World War II.
    Congress has authorized and appropriated 610 mln dlrs for
the project, the company said.
    If everything continues on schedule, work on the Ft. Drum,
N.Y. site is expected to begin later this month and is
scheduled for completion by early 1991, the company said.
    Martin said that an additional 50 mln dlrs in contracts to
small and disadvantaged businesses will be announced later.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac
said that on financial issues, the United States and France had
"very close" views, and he said Treasury Secretary James Baker
was determined to support the February 22 Paris agreement on
stabilizing foreign exchange parities.
    "I was very reassured by the determination of Mr. Baker to
support this agreement," he said.
    He described the dollar's sharp fall against the yen at the
start of the week as a "passing incident" and added, "Everyone is
resolved to support the Paris accord."
    Questioned about his plan to help the world's poorest
countries, Chirac said he did not envisage any large-scale debt
write-offs.
    "I don't think we can talk of write-offs - even the poorest
countries have not asked for that," he said.
    Chirac said he wanted commercial banks to give third world
countries better terms in rescheduling their debts, and for the
International Monetary Fund to soften its conditions.
    "One cannot pity the banks - they bear a lot of
responsibility due to the encouragement they gave to these
countries to take on debts. Now the banks are complaining but I
do not weep for them."

<TITLE>CONRAC &lt;CAX> EXPLORING RESTRUCTURING, BUYOUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     WASHINGTON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Conrac Corp, whose board has
rejected a 25 dlr a share tender offer from Mark IV Industries
Inc &lt;IV>, said it is exploring alternatives such as a
restructuring, leveraged buyout or takeover of the company.
     In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Conrac said its board of directors authorized its financial and
legal advisors to explore a several alternatives to the Mark IV
offer, which it said it considers inadequate.
    The alternatives being explored include a restructuring,
leveraged buyout or a takeover of the company by another
company, Conrac said.
    Conrac, which said its board discussed the alternatives at
special meetings on March 26 and 30, said that its decision on
whether to adopt any of the alternatives would hinge on "the
future actions of Mark IV" and its unsolicitied tender offer.
    Putting into effect any of the alternatives being explored
could hurt or defeat the Mark IV offer, it said.
    Board members were also instructed to keep confidential the
terms of any transaction that might be entered into until it
becomes final, the company said.
    The board also took other defensive steps, including
granting severance agreements to some officers, it said.
    At a board meeting yesterday, Concac's directors deleted a
provision allowing the holder of at least one-third of of all
classes of its voting stock to call a special shareholders
meeting and deleted another provision allowing shareholders to
remove directors without cause, the company said.
    The defensive moves were taken because Mark IV had said it
planned to elect a majority of its designees as directors at a
special holders meeting if it succeeded in acquring a majority
of the company's common stock in the offer, Conrac said.
    Conrac's president, vice president and treasurer were given
severance agreements, or "golden parachutes," it said.
    Under the agreements, Conrac President Paul Graf would get
a cash payment of twice his annual salary, which was 209,906
dlrs last year, if there were a change of control in the
company, including acquisition of 30 pct or more of the
company's voting stock, Conrac said.
    Treasurer Joseph Smorada and Vice President Joseph
O'Donnell, who made 143,325 dlrs last year, would get
one-and-a-half times his salary if there were a change in
control. Smorada's salary was not listed in the SEC filing.
    The executives would also get cash settlements of options
plans and continuation of insurance and other benefits.

executive board meeting will end tomorrow without any move to
reopen the debate on restoring coffee export quotas, delegates
said.
    Talks have focused on administrative matters and
verification of stocks in producer countries, they said.
    Producers met briefly today to exchange views on the market
situation but there seems little chance discussion on quotas
will begin much before the ICO's annual council session in
September, they said.
    Delegates earlier thought the meeting would end tonight,
but a further session is scheduled tomorrow at 1030 GMT to
complete reports on stock verification.
    Meantime, the executive board will meet May 12 to discuss
possible action on the consultancy report on the ICO presented
today to the board, consumer delegates said.

<TITLE>E.F.HUTTON &lt;EFH> EXTENDS PUROLATOR &lt;PCC> OFFER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>E.F. Hutton Group's E.F. Hutton LBO Inc
unit said it extended the expiration date for its 35 dlr per
share tender offer for Purolator Courier corp to midnight EST
April six from midnight April one.
    E.F. Hutton lbo inc said its wholly owned PC Acquisition
Inc subsidiary, which is the entity making the offer, extended
both expiration date and the withdrawal rights period for its
pending tender for 6.3 mln shares or 83 pct of Purolator
common.
    Hutton's offer was topped today by a 40 dlr per share bid
for 83 pct of the stock from Emery Air Frieght Corp &lt;EAF.>
    Both offers would pay shareholders a package of securities
for the balance of their shares, valued at the respective
tender offer prices.
    Hutton said as of the end of the day yesterday, about
880,000 shares of Purolator common stock repesenting 11.5 pct
of outstanding shares had been validly tendered and not
withdrawn.
    Manhattan supreme court justice Lewis Grossman today
adjourned until Monday a hearing on a stockholder suit seeking
to block the Hutton LBO transaction. The judge told attorneys
he needed time to hear other cases.
    Plaintiffs cited their belief that a superior offer would
be forthcoming, however one company mentioned in an affadavit,
Interlink Express plc, denied that it was interested.
    Yesterday, Frank Hoenemeyer, a retired vice chairman of
Prudential Insurance Co and currently a Purolator board member,
said an initial offer from Hutton was rejected by the board of
directors February third.
    Hoenemeyer testified that by the next meeting of the board,
February 17, Hutton submitted a revised proposal which was
accepted.
    He also testified a committee of directors had hired
Goldman Sachs and Co to consider alternatives to the Hutton
offer and also to consider a discussion of possible mergers
with other companies including Emery and Federal Express Corp
&lt;FDX>.

<TITLE>HEAVY RAINS DAMAGE ARGENTINE COARSE GRAINS CROP</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Manuel Villanueva</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BUENOS AIRES, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Fresh, heavy rains caused further
damage to the Argentine 1986/87 coarse grains crop in the week
to yesterday, particularly in Buenos Aires province, trade
sources said.
    They said the sunflower, maize, soybean and sorghum crops
were damaged and yield estimates affected. New production
forecasts were made for all these crops.
    The rains over the weekend and up to yesterday registered
more than 200 mm on average in western Buenos Aires and
worsened the flooding in various parts of the province.
    The weather bureau said the rains, which in Buenos Aires
have surpassed 750 mm in the last 30 days, could continue.
    The northeast of the country was also hit by heavy rains.
    In Corrientes province the rains also passed an average of
200 mm in some parts, notably the Paso de los Libres area
bordering on Uruguay.
    In Santa Fe and Entre Rios provinces they were over 100 mm
in places, in Misiones and San Luis 90 mm and in Cordoba 80 mm.
    The rains were less intense in Chaco and Formosa.
    Harvesting in areas not actually under water could also be
further delayed due to dampness in the earth, the sources said.
    The excessive humidity might also produce rotting of the
crops, further dimishing the yield, the sources added.
    Sunflower harvesting before the weekend rains reached 26 to
30 pct of the area sown in Santa Fe, Cordoba, La Pampa and
Buenos Aires provinces.
    The production forecast for 1986/87 sunflowerseed has been
lowered to between 2.2 and 2.4 mln tonnes, against 2.3 to 2.6
mln tonnes the previous week, making it 41.5 to 46.3 pct lower
than the record 4.1 mln tonnes produced last season.
    The area sown was two to 2.2 mln hectares, down 29.9 to
36.3 pct on the record 3.14 mln hectares in 1985/86.
    The maize harvest advanced to within 26 to 28 pct of the
area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires. It
will begin in La Pampa within about 10 days, weather
permitting.
    Maize yield this season is now estimated at 9.6 to 9.9 mln
tonnes, against last week's 9.9 to 10.1 mln tonnes, down 21.4
to 22.6 pct on the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes at which private
producers put 1985/86 production.
    The new forecast is 22.7 to 25 pct down on the official
figure of 12.8 mln tonnes for last season's production.
    The grain sorghum harvest reached 17 to 19 pct of growers'
targets, against 14 to 16 pct the previous week.
    The production forecast was reduced to between three and
3.3 mln tonnes, against 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes last week, 21.4
to 26.8 pct down on last season's 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes.
    The area sown with sorghum in 1986/87 was 1.23 to 1.30 mln
hectares, down 10.3 to 15.2 pct on the 1.45 mln in 1985/86.
    The forecast for soybean yield this season was the least
changed in relation to last week. It was put at a record 7.5 to
7.7 mln tonnes, against the previous 7.5 to 7.8 mln tonnes.
    These figures are 4.2 to 5.5 pct higher than last season's
record of 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes, according to private sources,
and 5.6 to 8.5 pct up on the official 7.1 mln tonnes.
    The adjustment to the production forecast is due to the
rains and overcast conditions which have greatly reduced the
sunlight needed for this crop, sources said.
    Producers fear estimates may yet have to be adjusted down
further.
    The humidity could induce rotting and growers are still
finding more empty pods due to excessively dry weather earlier
in the season.
    Soybean harvesting is due to start in mid-April in southern
Cordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires.

<TITLE>CHIRAC SEES QUICK DECISION ON CGCT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac
told U.S. congressmen France would announce a decision in two
to three weeks on which group is to control its second largest
communications firm, Compagnie Generale de Construction
Telphoniques, French sources said.
    They said Chirac promised that France's decision would be
based on financial, economic and technical criteria, and not on
political grounds.
    U.S. and German companies are the leading contenders to
take control of CGCT.
    The Reagan administration has warned France and Germany
that it may retaliate if control of the company is awarded on
political grounds.
    Jacques Delors, President of the European Community's
Executive Commission, called last month for control to go to
West Germany's Siemens AG in order to strengthen European
industry.
    The other leading contender is a consortium of American
Telephone and Telegraph Co &lt;T> with Philips NV of the
Netherlands.
    Chirac said France would make public its reasons for
awarding control, the sources said. He was asked about the
company's fate on two occasions, in meetings with leaders of
the Senate and House of Representatives.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIA STOCK EXCHANGES ENTER NEW ERA</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Bale, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Australian Stock Exchange Ltd (ASX)
today took up the responsibility for administering a new
coordinated market made up of Australia's six former exchanges,
now operating as subsidiary trading floors.
    At the same time, rules prohibiting corporations and
non-stock-exchange members from holding more than 50 pct of
Australia's 101 brokerage firms were abolished, leaving brokers
exposed to greater deregulation.
    Industry sources said the moves will smooth the changeover
to screen-based trading and give the equities market one voice.
    Westpac Banking Corp &lt;WSTP.S> was one of the first to take
advantage of the changes by announcing today it would double
its stake in the Sydney firm &lt;Ord Minnett Ltd> to 100 pct.
    Brokers have been introduced to creeping deregulation over
the past three years after legislation passed in 1984 to end
restrictive trade practices forced the traditional partnerships
to open themselves at first to partial ownership by outside
institutions, and eventually to full ownership.
    The phase-in period has ended, and several major banks and
offshore financial institutions are investigating taking larger
stakes in Australian broking houses, industry sources said.
    Though deregulation was all but forced on brokers, most now
acknowledge that the influx of capital and contacts from
non-member shareholders has benefited the industry, they said.
    "Deregulation has brought an infusion of additional capital
and a broader base of products," ASX chairman Ian Roach told
Reuters.
    Roach said fears that major bank shareholders would impose
a restrictive and conservative "bank culture" on the dynamic
sharebroking industry were unfounded.
    "So far the banks have been mindful of the importance of
preserving the entrepreneurial aspect of sharebroking," he said.
    But some brokers said others are sceptical and expect that
the expiration of "golden handcuff" pacts, which tied partners to
their firms for a period after incorporation, could cause a
massive talent drain.
    Several leading brokers have already announced plans to
leave their firms and establish new private client businesses,
while others plan public floats.
    While bank shareholders have enjoyed dabbling in broking
during Australia's record two-and-a-half year bull run, they
could find themselves without the expertise they need during
more difficult times, some brokers said.
    Rene Rivkin, head of Sydney brokerage house &lt;Rivkin James
Capel Ltd>, said many brokers will resist anything that
restricts their individuality and entrepreneurial spirit, and
this could leave new entrants into the business short-staffed.
    "If I were a bank I'm not sure I would have gone into
broking.... What's going to happen when a lot of these golden
handcuffs come to an end?" Rivkin said.
    "Only then will the banks know what they've got," he said.
    Rivkin's firm is 50 pct owned by Hongkong and Shanghai
Banking Corp &lt;HKBH.HK> unit &lt;Wardley Australia Ltd> and plans a
public float of between 25 and 30 pct.
    "My relationship with the Hong Kong bank is wonderful. They
leave me alone and give me all the support I need.... Maybe if
we weren't doing so well there wouldn't be that support, but
that hasn't happened," he said.
    Other firms might not be so lucky, he said, and they could
find it difficult to preserve their independence when the bull
market ends.
    In the last two years, the value of the Australian
sharemarket has leapt 118 pct with turnover value up 152 pct to
31.24 billion dlrs in the year to June 30, 1986.
    That growth put existing trading systems and clearing
houses under pressure, and unification of the six sovereign
exchanges should accelerate the development of screen-based
trading and a single clearing house, industry sources said.
    From July this year 30 leading stocks will be traded in a
pilot of the ASX's screen trading system which, depending on
its reception by brokers, is expected to replace trading floors
over the next four years, industry sources said.

<TITLE>WALL STREET STOCKS/PACIFIC GAS &lt;PCG></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pacific Gas and Electric Co's plan
to change its accounting methods for nuclear plant revenues,
together with the prospect of higher higher domestic interest
rates, helped push the company's stock price down 2-1/8 to 22,
utility analysts and company executives said.
    Pacific Gas said yesterday that a change in the method for
accounting for its Diablo Canyon Nuclear power plant revenues
will result in a 470 mln dlr reduction in 1987 earnings.
    The company also said it intends to continue paying its
common stock dividend at the current annual rate of 1.92 dlrs
per share.
    But the move also means that the company is not likely to
increase its dividend for perhaps as long as three years, said
Mark Luftig, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc.
    "Anybody looking for a dividend increase has been
dissapointed (by the announcement)," Luftig said.
    Pacific Gas has raised its common stock dividend on a
regular basis for the past 10 years, a company spokeswoman
said.
    In addition, she also pointed out that prospects for higher
interest rates may also be affecting Pacific Gas trading
activity.
    Citicorp &lt;CCI> and Chase Manhattan Corp &lt;CMB> yesterday
increased their prime lending rates to 7-3/4 pct from 7-1/2
pct. It was the first rate increase by the big banks in nearly
three years.
    Utility earnings are sensitive to interest rate increases
because of the high levels of borrowings needed to finance
ongoing construction projects.
    Despite the market reaction, First Boston Corp analyst
Arlene Barnes applauded the Pacific Gas decision.
    "This is a very prudent move on management's part," said
Barnes.
    Rather than using accounting tools to reflect income it is
not taking in, the company will now account for only the 40 pct
of the cost of owning and operating the plant that regulators
are allowing in the form of interim rate relief, Barnes said.
    Pacific Gas had been carrying the other 60 pct as a
deferred cash receivable and accounted for the non-cash item as
income.
    "They'll take the hit this year, but at least we'll be
looking at an honest earnings picture," Barnes also said.

    "The court has validated our contention that the user
interface and the appearnace of a product is a vital element of
the product and is protectable by U.S. copyright law," the
company said.
    Digital said the ruling involved a copyright infringement
suit filed against Softklone by Microstuf Inc, which Digital
acquired in October 1986.
    The suit charged that Softklone's Mirror software product
violated the copyright of Microstuf's CrossTalk program,
Digital said.

<TITLE>U.S. FARM REORGANIZATIONS PROVING COSTLY - GAO</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. farmers who reorganize their
operations to circumvent a cap on federal payments could add
2.3 billion dlrs to the cost of the government's agricultural
programs by 1989, the General Accounting Office, GAO, said.
    "We estimate that should the trend in farm reorganizations
continue, reorganizations since 1984 could be adding almost 900
mln dlrs annually to program costs by 1989," GAO Senior
Associate Director Brian Crowley said.
    "Cumulative costs for the six-year period, 1984 to 1989,
could approach 2.3 billion dlrs," he said.
    Between 1984 and 1986, reorganizations added almost 9,000
new persons to U.S. Agriculture Department payment rolls,
Crowley told the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Wheat,
Soybeans and Feedgrains.

<TITLE>TALKING POINT/PUROLATOR COURIER &lt;PCC></TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Patti Domm, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    New York, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Emery Air Freight Corp topped a
leveraged buyout offer for Purolator Courier Corp by about 40
mln dlrs, but Wall Street is reacting as though another offer
may surface.
    Purolator's stock climbed 5-3/8 today, to 40-1/8, 1/4 over
Emery's 40 dlr per share offer. Emery topped a 35 dlr per share
or 268 mln dlr offer from E.F. Hutton LBO Inc.
    Some analysts said the latest, 306 mln dlr offer for
Purolator exceeded their expectations.
    Several analysts previously had said they saw takeover
values for the package delivery company in the 35 dlr per share
range. At least one, however, estimated the company could be
taken over in a range of 38 to 42 dlrs per share.
    Analysts today would not venture to say whether another
offer could be made, but some arbitragers still held to the
belief that the bidding could go higher.
    "They have no choice to seek out the best possible offer.
Emery has shown the courage to go forth," said one arbitrager,
who speculated other courier companies may also emerge as
bidders.
    "It makes sense," said James Parker of Robinson Humphrey.
But "It won't make out as well as they think. They won't get a
100 pct of the synergies."
    Analysts said the acquisition could cost Emery earnings in
the short term, but long term, after eliminating redundancies
and selling other Purolator assets, it should boost Emery's
profitability.
    Parker said a combined Purolator and Emery would rival
United Parcel Service as the second largest U.S. package
delivery company after Federal Express Corp &lt;FDX>, which has 47
pct of the market.
    Parker speculated that the combined Emery-Purolator would
have about 24 pct of the six to seven billion dlr delivery
business.
    "This will make Emery a bigger factor in the light weight
(delivery) business, but it will not make them a power house,"
said Douglas Arthur of Kidder, Peabody and Co.
    Purolator today declined comment on the Emery offer, and
its chairman Nicholas Brady did not return a phone call.
    E.F.Hutton LBO also declined comment on the Emery offer,
but said it extended the expiration and withdrawal period on
its offer to April six at midnight from today at midnight EST.
    One analyst speculated the extension makes it more likely
Hutton will attempt another offer. However, he was skeptical a
company outside the package delivery industry would want to
outbid 40 dlrs per share because it would not have the same 
synergies as a courier company.
    Since Purolator agreed in late February to a buyout by some
of its management and the E.F. Hutton Group &lt;EFH> subsidiary,
speculation has arisen that more bidding was to come.
    The buyout was surrounded by controversy since a Purolator
board member, Doresy Gardner resigned in March. Gardner said he
believed a better offer could be made by another entity.
    A spokesman for Gardner today said the former director had
no contact with Emery, nor did he have any other buyers lined
up for Purolator.
    Purolator's deal with Hutton was also called into question
by a shareholder suit filed earlier this week, which attempted
to stop the tender offer to allow another bidder to come forth.
Hearings in a New York state court were delayed until Monday.
    Arbitragers had said they believed the Hutton offer could
be bettered because the Wall Street firm was not planning to
keep its cash tied up in Purolator. Hutton is providing a 279
mln dlr "bridge" loan that would later be replaced with other
debt. Hutton would maintain a majority interest in Purolator.
    Hutton sources have said the firm was in fact facing risk n
its investment since it did not know when it could reclaim its
279 mln dlr loan.
    Emery last year lost 5.4 mln dlrs on revenues of 887.5 mln
dlrs. Purolator lost 57.6 mln dlrs on 841.4 mln dlrs in
revenues.

<TITLE>CANADIAN IMPERIAL BANK LOWERING VISA RATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce>
said it was lowering the interest rate on its Visa credit card
to 15.9 pct from 18.6 pct, effective with the May billing
statement.
    The bank said it was also halving its yearly Visa card user
fee to six dlrs, but would retain its 15 ct fee for each
transaction.
    A bank spokesman said the previously reported call by the
Canadian Parliament's finance committee on March 20 for a
substantial cut in credit card rates "was a factor" in the
move, but he would not elaborate.
    Canada's minister of state for finance Thomas Hockin had
threatened legislation to reduce the rates, which apply to
unpaid balances, if the financial institutions did not
voluntarily act.
    The Canadian Imperial Bank spokesman said "the bank card
market is a very competitive one and we have to move to stay
competitive."
    Canadian Imperial's new rates match those of &lt;Toronto
Dominion Bank>, which lowered its rates before the finance
committee report.
    Canadian Imperial Bank added that cardholders will be
allowed to choose between the 15 ct transaction fee or the six
dlr yearly card fee.
    It will also eliminate the 50 ct minimum monthly
transaction fee, it said.
    Minister of State for Finance, Tom Hockin, said in the
House of Commons today he was "delighted" with the bank's cut
in its credit card rate.
    "I would hope retail stores and other financial
institutions will look to their rates as well," Hockin said
during the daily question period.

    First Boston won the bonds in competitive bidding. It bid

    The bonds have an average life of 11.5 years and are rated

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Rumors that New York investor Asher
Edelman has acquired a stake in Polaroid Corp and optimism
about tomorrow's status hearing on the patent infringement suit
pending with Eastman Kodak Co &lt;EK> sent Polaroid's stock
higher, traders said.
    Polaroid rose 1-1/8 to 74-1/2.
    "Speculation that Edelman was going to take a stake in
Polaroid was kicking around a few months ago, and resurfaced
today," one trader said.
    Edelman had no comment on the rumors.
    A spokesman for Polaroid said the company had not been
contacted by Edelman and no filing had been made with the
Securities and Exchange Commission about a stake in the
company.
    "There is some hope among investors that there will some
progress in the status hearing tomorrow on the patent
infringement suit with Kodak," analyst Michael Ellmann of
Wertheim and Co said.
    Traders said it is conceivable that a trial date could be
set or some progress made on an out-of-court settlement.
    The suit, filed by Polaroid in April 1976, charges that
Kodak infringed upon Polaroid's instant camera patent. In
October 1985, the court barred Kodak from selling cameras or
film that infringe upon the patent, the Polaroid spokesman
said.
    Ellmann said he feels it is highly unlikely that any
progress will be made in tomorrow's hearing.
    Ellmann said the stock may have also gotten a boost today
from some optimism concerning new products the company is
currently working on.
    "Polaroid's announcement that a particularly senior company
executive had been chosen to work on a major unidentified new
product spurred some speculation about their products," he
said. "I am speculating that the new product could be an
electronic still camera," referring to a camera that records
its images on magnetic disks as opposed to conventional film.

<TITLE>NY ANALYSTS SEE COFFEE FUTURES FALLING FURTHER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>New York coffee futures prices will
probably fall to about 85 cents a lb in the next month before a
consolidation trend sets in, according to market analysts.
    Yesterday, prices for the spot May contract fell below 1.00
dlr a lb for the first time since August 1981 after the
International Coffee Organization did not place new export
quota discussions on its current agenda.
    Talks aimed at renegotiating ICO export quotas, after five
years of price-supporting agreements, broke down in February.
    "Short-term, it looks like a definite test of 90 cents,
perhaps 85 cents," said William O'Neill, coffee analyst with
Elders Futures. "But the additional downside may not be all
that great from current levels."
    "At this price level the market is very vulnerable to
bullish developments," O'Neill added. "Rather than us having a
market that will plummet we'll kind of see prices erode --
probably to around 85 cents."
    "I definitely see 90 cents and would not rule out a brief
drop to 85 cents," said Debra Tropp, a coffee analyst with
Prudential Bache. But she said by June worries about a freeze
in Brazil growing areas will become more of a market factor,
with prices likely to consolidate ahead of that time.
    A trader at a major international trade house, who asked
not to be named, said he expects a 10 cent drop near term but
believes if Brazil opens May registrations at a relatively high
export price and requires a high contribution quota from
exporters the market could steady at the lower levels.
    Longer term, he added, producer pressure will mount on
Brazil to agree to consumers' export quota terms, and a new
international agreement could come into force next fall.
    Since the February talks broke down, the market has fallen
from about 130.00 cents a lb to a low of 98.10 cents a lb
today, as buyers and sellers sought to reassess supply and
demand.
    Generally, analysts say, producers have a large buildup of
stocks, but U.S. roasters have drawn down supplies and will
need to do some buying soon.
    "Most producing nations have just completed or are about to
complete their annual harvests and exportable supplies are at
their seasonal peak. Exports remain behind year ago and
warehouses in producer nations are becoming increasingly
overburdened," said Sandra Kaul, coffee analyst for Shearson
Lehman, in that firm's forthcoming quarterly coffee report.
    Kaul said producers' need to procure hard currency to
service foreign debt will put further pressure on them to sell,
and "this should keep substantial pressure on exporters to
undertake sales despite the drop in prices to six year lows."
    Kaul believes the market will drop to 80 cents a lb before
Brazil's frost season begins in June.
    Accurate assessments of roaster demand are hard to come by,
though analysts note the peak winter consumption period is
passed and demand usually slows this time of year.
    Shearson's Kaul estimated U.S. roaster ending stocks as of
January 31, including soluble and roasted, at 6.3 mln bags
compared with 6.9 mln at end-September 1986, a small drawdown
for the usually busy winter roasting season.
    But Elders O'Neill said, "The roasters are not overstocked
by any means."
    Analysts said picking a bottom to the market is difficult,
given the fact prices have fallen into uncharted territory
below the long-term support at 1.00 dlr per lb, and several
traders said the sidelines might be preferable for the short
term.

<TITLE>ENERGY/U.S. REFINING</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>     By BERNICE NAPACH, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>     NEW YORK, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. refiners said they are worried
that growing supplies of imports, proposed federal
environmental regulations, and the marketing of a third grade
of unleaded gasoline would cost them dearly and at a time when
the industry is recovering from a recent slump.
     "We have to look at national security and cut the amount
of products and crude coming into the country if it hurts the
industry," said Archie Dunham, vice president of petroleum
products at Conoco, subsidiary of DuPont Corp (DD).
    U.S. oil imports account for about 38 pct of U.S.
consumption but are expected to rise to 50 pct by the mid
1990s, according to the Department of Energy.
    "Can we afford to import 60 or 70 pct of our oil
requirements 15 or so years from now?" asked John Swearingen,
chairman of the board of Continental Illinois Corp &lt;CIL> and
former chief executive of Amoco Corp &lt;AN>. "If your answer to
that question raises doubt, then it behooves us to do all that
we can now to cope with this situation and improve our
position."
    But Swearingen said he opposed the idea of an import fee, a
view echoed by others attending this week's National Petroleum
Refiners Association meeting in San Antonio, Texas.
    "Talk of an import surcharge or controls is not encouraging
because those things won't solve our problems and could well
compound them," said Swearingen. "Once the government affects
values, once an import quota or license has value, it's going
to be subverted by government," he added.
     William Martin, deputy Energy Secretary, said the costs of
an import fee outweigh its benefits and suggested, as Energy
Secretary John Herrington has, depletion tax credits to
encourage domestic production and limit oil imports. He also
said altnerative energy sources should be encouraged.
     Restoration of the depletion allowance for a 27 pct
deduction from the taxable income of oil companies is 
controversal but might work, said Dunham.
    Dunham and other officials opposed the idea of a fee on oil
imports but said if one is enacted it must tax crude and
product imports.
    "Why would companies import crude when they could import
products for a smaller cost if there were only a fee on crude?"
asked Henry Rosenberg, chairman of Crown Central Petroleum
&lt;CNP>.
     An import fee would raise the costs of U.S. petrochemical
products and make them noncompetive on the world market, Dunham
said.
     "The energy security issue should be considered when
environmental issues are considered," Martin said.
    "The level of investment for the proposed lowering of
sulfur level of diesel to 0.05 pct by weight, for example, is
unacceptable," Dunham said. "Most companies cannot afford it."
    George Unzelman, president of HyOx, Inc., said these
proposals "will place pressure on small refining operations and
promote further industry consolidation."
     An NPRA survey of of 139 refineries, which was released at
the conference, said reducing sulphur content to 0.05 pct
weight and aromatics to 20 volume pct aromatics in highway
diesel fuel would cost refiners 6.65 billion dlrs.
     The national average diesel fuel sulfur content in 1986
for the survey respondents was 0.27 weight pct while the
average aromatics content was 32 pct.
     Another possible cost to refiners is the upgrading of
facilities to produce a third grade of unleaded gasoline which
is beginning to be marketed by some companies.
    "What will be the standard octane level in various grades
of unleaded gasoline?" asked Dunham. "A midlevel grade of
unleaded gasoline with an octane level of 89 means an
investment has to be made," Dunham said.
     This grade is not warranted, said Crown's Rosenberg.
     Despite these concerns, refiners are expecting margins to
move higher in the next few months.
     "We are beginning to see a return in wholesale margins,"
said Roger Hemminghaus, chairman of the refining and marketing
company that is to spin off from Diamond Shamrock Corp &lt;DIA>.
     Margins are higher because the OPEC pact is holding, U.S.
stocks of gasoline and heating oil are declining, and gasoline
demand is rising as the driving season approaches, he said.
     "This summer could be a good season for selling gasoline,"
Hemminghaus said, adding that the new company will be primarily
a gasoline producer.

to about 355 mln dlrs in 1987, up from 289 mln dlrs a year ago.
    However, senior vice president of finance Daniel Miglio
told a meeting of analysts that there was some uncertainty in
its earnings outlook because SNET is currently involved in
negotiations with state regulators on its rate of return on

    The company also said it expects its SNET Systems business,
which is composed of some of its non-regulated businesses, to
be profitable by the end of the year.

<TITLE>MOODY'S MAY LOWER GAF &lt;GAF>, BORG-WARNER &lt;BOR></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Moody's Investors Service Inc said it
may downgrade the debt ratings of GAF Corp because of its 3.1
billion dlr acquisition offer for Borg-Warner Corp.
    In a related action, the agency changed to possible
downgrade from uncertain the direction of its current review of
Borg-Warner's 1.2 billion dlrs of debt.
    GAF has 416 mln dlrs of debt outstanding.
    Moody's said it would study the degree of financial risk
the acquisition offer represents for GAF. The agency will also
consider the possibility of future asset sales to reduce
acquisition-related debt.
    However, Moody's noted that GAF has demonstrated an ability
to profit from takeover attempts.
    GAF currently carries Ba-2 sinking fund debentures and B-1
senior subordinated notes and debentures.
    Moody's said its review of Borg-Warner and the unit
Borg-Warner Acceptance Corp would focus on the effects of the
proposed acquisition on Borg-Warner's cash flow and debt
protection measurements.
    Moody's will also consider the implications of possible
defensive measures that Borg-Warner may undertake. The parent
has A-1 senior debt and the unit carries A-2 senior debt.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The House Banking Committee voted
45-5 in favor of a bill to raise five billion dlrs over two
years to assist the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
    The Federal Home Loan Banks would borrow the five billion
dlrs in financial markets to assist the FSLIC, which government
auditors have said is approaching  bankruptcy.
    The committee narrowly rejected a version of the
legislation that would have permitted 15 billion dlrs in
borrowing authority over a longer time and was the version
favored by the administration.
    The committee, backed by committee chariman Fernand St
Germain (D-RI) and House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex), voted
25-24 to change the amount of borrowing authority.
    In addition to the funds raised in capital markets, the
FSLIC would receive another five billion dlrs in assessments on
financial institutions belonging the fund.
    The bill also requires regulators to apply more liberal
standards when deciding whether to close ailing thrifts in
depressed regions.
    The bill now goes to the full house.
    The Senate has passed a bill providing for a 7.5 billion
dlr recapitalization for FSLIC.

<TITLE>&lt;CRIME CONTROL> ASSETS TO BE SOLD TO HAWLEY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    INDIANAPOLIS, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Crime Control Inc said it reached a
definitive agreement under which a subsidiary of Hawley Group
Ltd will buy assets and assume certain liabilities of Crime
Control for 51.3 mln dlrs.
    Of this amount, it said about 47 mln dlrs would be
available for distribution to the company's banks, debenture
holders and shareholders. The balance would be used to pay
various state taxes and other expenses relating to the
transaction, and to establish reserves to provide for certain
unassumed obligations of the company.
    Crime Control said it would use proceeds to pay its bank
lenders approximately 28.6 mln dlrs, representing about 87 pct
of the principal amount of all its indebtedness to bank
lenders.
    It also said it would propose to acquire all of its 20 mln
dlrs worth of outstanding 10 pct convertible subordinated
debentures for an aggregate of approximately 15.4 mln dlrs and
propose liquidation of the company with shareholders receiving
an estimated 54 cts a share.
    As reported earlier, Crime Control is in default on
approximately 33 mln dlrs of bank debt and in default under the
indenture governing its convertible subordinated debentures.
    On January 19, 1987, Crime Control, which installs,
services and monitors electronic surveillance systems, said it
retained Rothschild Inc to arrange for the sale of the company.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>ANALYSTS SAY USSR MAY PREFER NEW CROP U.S. WHEAT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Soviet Union would likely be more
interested in purchasing new crop wheat than in booking any
grain for immediate shipment if offered a subsidy on U.S.
wheat, an executive with a major grain export company said.
    Lower prices and the desire to delay any big purchases
until the condition of winter and spring crops is better known
make new crop wheat more attractive, said George Hoffman,
director of commodity analysis for The Pillsbury Company.
    "Pillsbury is assuming that they (Soviets) will be offered
a subsidy and that it will be a subsidy that they can respond
to," Hoffman told Reuters in an interview at an agribusiness
education conference here. But if there are too many
constraints placed on a subsidy offer, the USSR will take less
than an anticipated four mln tonnes, he said.
    Hoffman said Pillsbury's internal statistics put Soviet
Union wheat purchases at only two mln tonnes under a subsidy
offer. However, if a subsidy is offered at competitive levels,
Moscow would likely buy more, he said.
    "If we give the Soviets the same deal as the Chinese, I
expect they'll take it," said Vernon McMinimy, director of
commodity research for A.E. Staley Manufacturing Co.
    McMinimy told Reuters spring weather and its impact on
crops will determine how much wheat Moscow would buy under a
subsidy offer.
    Soviet winter crops did not get off to a good start because
of a dry autumn last year, and because of the severe winter
"they probably have had more damage due to winter weather than
normal," McMinimy said.

<TITLE>DIAMOND SHAMROCK &lt;DIA> TO RAISE SHARE VALUES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    by TED D'AFFLISIO, REUTERS</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, APRIL 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Diamond Shamrock executives said that
to reduce the vulnerability to takeover pressures, they want to
raise the value of the two companies to be formed by splitting
Diamond Shamrock.
    "If we can get the price up to the value of the company, we
will not be vulnerable to takeover pressure," said Charles
Blackburn, Diamond Shamrock's president and soon to be chief
executive officer of the new exploration and producing company
whose name has not yet been decided. He was visiting New York
for talks with investors.
    After successfully countering a takeover bid launched by T.
Boone pickens in January, Diamond Shamrock said it would
spinoff its refining and marketing operation into Diamond
Shamrock Refining and Marketing Co before its April 30 annual
meeting.
    Blackburn told Reuters, "Our advisors told us that a split
would give a better share value to investors and that the
market would give better multiples for pure refining and
marketing and exploration and production plays."
    The two companies are now in the process of organizing
themselves to become "pure plays," the executives said.
    Blackburn said the new company would be a pure exploration
and production operation and that he was looking to divest
non-oil and gas operations, particularly Diamond Shamrock's
coal operations.
    Blackburn said that "we are in talks about coal operations
but I cannot discuss this further at this time."
    He said the company would have a debt-to-capital ratio of
about 38 pct, which could be paid down over time.
    Blackburn said the company would seek to generate further
internal savings from rationalizing operations and personnel
reductions. He has set a goal of 73 mln dlrs in internal
savings and "we need to get at least 20 mln dlrs of that savings
in 1987," Blackburn said.
    "I would rather describe this as savings coming from
eliminating non-essential activities as we purify the
exploration and production business."
    "There are some people associated with those activities but
it is more a matter of cutting and trimming rather than
wholesale changes," Blackburn said.
    Blackburn intends to run a tight ship in which dividends
will not initially be paid and the resultant savings invested
into exploration and production.
    "Our goal is to find 20 mln barrels a year in the U.S. to
replace our production and I think that we can do this at the
level we intend to spend," Blackburn said.
    "It might be more difficult to find more oil and more oil
internationally at these levels," he added.
    Blackburn said that his new company would spend 75 mln dlrs
in North America and 90 mln dlrs overseas, mainly Indonesia, in
the search for oil and gas reserves.
    In 1986 Diamond Shamrock produced 82,473 mln barrels a day
of oil with 83 pct of that from Indonesia, while gas output was
265.6 mln cubic feet a day of which 98 pct was in the U.S.
    Blackburn said that he believed he could find oil to
replace this production at low costs which were 4.97 dlrs a
barrel worldwide and 3.88 dlrs a barrel in the U.S..
    Blackburn also said that the company would be willing to
buy reserves, "if we can find the right producing properties at
the right price".
    Blackburn estimated that oil prices will average about 18
dlrs a barrel this year with average prices received for
natural gas at 1.57 dlrs per thousand cubic feet.
    Blackburn said he currently estimates that at thee prices
for its products the company will have a cash flow of about 280
mln dlrs.
    "This will mean a net negative cash flow as we pretty much
spend our cash flow to find more oil and gas."
    Blackburn said the company will search for both oil and gas
"almost exclusively in estasblished basins".
    Roger Hemminghaus, who will be chairman of the new Diamond
Shamrock Refining and Marketing Co, which last year had sales
of approximately 1.6 billion dlrs, told Reuters his company was
taking on some debt.
    "We are taking on some 400 mln dlrs new debt with three tier
financing emphasizing a revolving loan, some term loans and
some unsecured private placement and are now in the latter
stages of signing an agreement."
    Chemical New York Corp &lt;CHL> is the company's lead banker
on the loan, Hemminghaus said.
    That debt will set the company off at a 60 pct debt-to-
capital-ratio, which Hemminghaus said "is too much. To
alleviate that we will hold our capital expenditures down and
pay down debt so that at the end of two years that ratio will
be reduced to mid 40 pct range."
    Hemminghhaus said that cash flow will be "plus or minus
about 100 mln dlrs a year from earnings and depreciation."
    In terms of major projects, Hemminghaus said that capital
expenditures will be 35 mln dlrs to 50 mln dlrs spread over all
of the company's projects.
    Its major project will be a two year upgrading project on
its McKee reinery in the Panhandle at 90,000 bpd rated
capacity.
    The company also has a refinery south of San Antonio where
it will be headquartered with a capacity of 35,000 bpd.

<TITLE>TALKING POINT/DOME PETROLEUM &lt;DMP></TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By LARRY WELSH, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dome Petroleum Ltd's loss of 2.20
billion dlrs, believed to be the biggest ever by a Canadian
company, will have little impact on daily operations but will
pressure creditors to accept a proposal to restructure Dome's
debt of more than 6.10 billion dlrs, industry analysts said.
    "Essentially what it (Dome's loss) does is put more focus on
the importance of the restructuring and puts more pressure on
creditors to agree to the debt rescheduling," said an oil
analyst who asked that he not be identified.
    Dome reported earnings yesterday.
    Analysts said the huge loss improves the appeal of a debt
accord by underlining company statements that creditors would
receive little or nothing under a forced liquidation that could
take several years to complete.
    After several months of negotiations with a group of 56
major creditors and other unsecured public debt holders, Dome
submitted a complex proposal earlier this month that includes
converting debt to equity and extending repayment time.
    "They've had their talks and now they have the proposal, so
the banks have to decide whether to accept the restructuring or
pull the plug," the analyst said.
    He and others said the huge loss, including writedowns
totalling 2.08 billion dlrs before a 571 mln dlr reduction in
deferred income taxes, dramatically enforces the company's
claim that a 50 pct drop in world oil prices has crippled its
financial position.
    But analysts said the writedown only impacts Dome's balance
sheet and does not hurt the company's cash position.
    "To a large extent, these writeoffs of the carrying value of
assets is really just the bookkeepers catching up to what the
stock market has been telling us for a long time, reflecting
the collapse in oil prices," Peters and Co Ltd analyst Wilf
Gobert said.
    Dome reported it took a 1.20 billion charge in the fourth
quarter, before a 305 mln dlr reduction in deferred income
taxes, for the decline in value of Dome's oil and gas
properties.
    The extraordinary loss conformed with new Canadian
Institute of Chartered Accountants guidelines that require Dome
to use average 1986 oil prices to value its holdings, instead
of an escalating price method used in prior years.
    Analysts said six individual Swiss noteholders, who
initiated legal action against Dome to recover debt of 408,500
dlrs, will also be pressed to adopt a more lenient stand by the
1986 results.
    "To the extent that individuals were not fully accepting or
cognizant of the seriousness of Dome's financial position, the
financial statements reflecting this writedown of the value of
assets is certainly going to indicate the depth of the
hemorrhaging that has taken place," Gobert said.
    The legal action now before Swiss courts threatens to
trigger cross-defaults on all of Dome's debt, toppling the
delicate debt negotiations. Dome is next scheduled to appear
April six to defend against the action.
    First Marathon Securities Ltd analyst Rick Hallisey said
the size of the loss was slightly larger than industry
estimates of Dome's negative net worth, ranging between 1.50
billion and two billion dlrs.
    "What this writedown says is that a lot of the money that
was spent in the past is unrecoverable, but the shareholders
have already recognized that through the writedown in the stock
price," Gobert said, adding, "The financial statements have come
out and said that what has happened in the past has been a
disaster for Dome," Gobert added.
    The price of Dome common shares fell five cts to 1.05 dlrs
in trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange today. At the height
of Dome's success in 1981, common traded at about 25 dlrs a
share.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>A committee of independent directors of
the Standard Oil Co unsuccessfully sought a delay in a tender
offer for Standard shares by British Petroleum Co plc,
according to offering documents.
    BP's offering document for its 70 dlr per share offer
describes discussions with Douglas Danforth, who chairs a
special committee of independent directors responsible for
monitoring relations with BP. BP has been owner of a 55 pct
stake in Standard for several years.
    According to the document, the committee's counsel said it
needed one to two months to evaluate the offering price.
    Danforth, who is chairman of the Westinghouse Electric Co
&lt;WX>, first learned of BP's interest in acquiring the rest of
Standard in a telephone call March five from Sir Peter Walters,
chairman of BP.
    At a meeting march nine, Danforth informed BP that the
special committee had hired First Boston Corp &lt;FBC> as its
financial adviser and also retained independent counsel.
    Danforth's concerns that the special committee did not have
sufficient time were expressed to Walters in a telephone
conversation and reiterated in a letter from counsel on Monday
of this week.

<TITLE>BANKAMERICA &lt;BAC> PUTS BRAZIL ON NON-ACCRUAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAN FRANCISCO, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>BankAmerica Corp said it placed
its 1.9 billion dlrs in medium- and long-term term loans to the
Brazilian public and private sectors on non-accrual status as
of March 31.
    As a result, the bank's net income for the first quarter
will be reduced by about 40 mln dlrs. If Brazil's suspension of
interest payments remains in effect, earnings for the whole
year will be reduced by a further 100 mln dlrs.
    BankAmerica said, however, that it expects to report a
profit for the first quarter of 1987.
    BankAmerica also said that it had placed 180 mln dlrs of
loans to Ecuador on non-accrual, which will reduce
first-quarter earnings by about five mln dlrs.
    If no interest payments are received for the rest of the
year from Ecuador, which is recovering from a severe
earthquake, 1987 earnings will be cut by a further 10 mln dlrs.
    But, "barring substantialy increased instabilities in
developing countries," BankAmerica said it continues to
anticipate an operating profit in 1987.
    In the first quarter of 1986 BankAmerica earned a profit of
63 mln dlrs but turned in a loss of 518 mln dlrs for the year
as a whole.
    BankAmerica also said it completed yesterday the previously
announced sale of its discount brokerage subsidiary, Charles
Schwab Corp. The sale was part of a program of asset disposals
undertaken to staunch losses at the nation's second largest
bank holding company.
    BankAmerica stressed that it expects Brazil will eventually
reach a debt rescheduling agreement which will provide for the
payment of interest being deferred in 1987.
    "Negotiations will be complicated and lengthy, but we
continue to expect that a rescheduling agreement will be
completed this year," said A.W. Clausen, BankAmerica's chairman
and chief executive officer.
    "For the interim period, however, we concluded that the
responsible procedure would be to record income only as we
receive payments on the loans," he added in a statement.
    U.S. banks are not legally required to place loans on
non-accrual until interest becomes more than 90 days overdue.
    By striking accrued, but unpaid, interest from their
accounts earlier than necessary, the banks are signalling to
Brazil their readiness to dig in for a long fight over the
terms of the rescheduling agreement regardless of the
short-term earnings impact, banking analysts said.
    Brazil suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of
its 109 billion dlr foreign debt in February, citing a drop in
official reserves, and said interest payments would be held on
deposit at the central bank pending a rescheduling.
    It also froze some 16 billion dlrs of short term credit
lines which banks were committed to provide until March 31.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Emery Air Frieght Corp, which has
launched a 40 dlr a share tender offer for 83 pct of Purolator
Courier Corp, said it would sell some Purolator assets to help
pay the estimated 265 mln dlr cost of the stock purchase deal.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Emery said it would sell or lease Purolator's air hub in
Indianapolis, Ind., which is currently under construction, and
would divest Purolator's Stant Inc subsidiary.
    No indications of interest for the assets have been
received so far, Emery said.
    Emery said it would operate Purolator as a subsidiary if it
succeeded in the takever, but would integrate its air hub.
    It said it plans to finance its stock purchases with
borrowings from Chemical Bank, Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New
York, Bankers Trust Co and Salomon Brothers Holding Co Inc, the
parent of Salmon Brothers Inc, Emery's financial advisor.
    Emery said it already has a commitment letter from its
banks for up to 129.9 mln dlrs for the stock purchases. An
unspecified amount of internally generated funds would also be
used for the stock purchases, it added.

<TITLE>JOHNSTOWN AMERICAN &lt;JAC> MAKES EXCHANGE OFFER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ATLANTA, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Johnstown American Cos said it began a
tender offer for the 500,000 outstanding shares of its 1985
preferred stock.
    Under the offer, the company said holders of the preferred
would receive one share of a new issue of convertible
redeemable preferred stock for each share of their 1985
preferred.
    The company said terms of the new preferred will permit it
to redeem and retire the 1985 preferred shares at a discount
from their current liquidation value of 50 mln dlrs, or 100
dlrs a share.
    The company said that if all the 1985 preferred shares are
tendered, it will issue 500,000 1987 preferred shares, disburse
250,000 dlrs and cancel all 1985 preferred shares that are
tendered.
    The company said that if it elects to redeem the 1987
preferred, it must pay holders 12.3 mln dlrs in cash.
    It said it must also issue warrants for the purchase of
three mln common shares at a price of 4.50 dlrs a share or 33
pct over the market price on the day before the notice of
redemption, whichever is greater.
    The company said the exchange offer is conditioned on
tendering shareholders releasing certain rights to contingent
payouts and profit-share interests that were given in
connection with its 1985 acquisition of Consolidated Capital
Equities Corp and Johnstown Management Co.
    The offer, it said, is also conditioned on the tender of at
least two-thirds of the outstanding preferred shares. The
company said the exchange offer will expire at 1500 EST on May
one, unless extended.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan appears to be relying less on
corn from China, Argentina and South Africa and more on
supplies from the United States, the U.S. Agriculture
Department said.
    In its World Production and Trade report, the department
said in the past seven weeks reported U.S. corn sales of nearly
three mln tonnes to Japan are about three times the level
during this period last year.
    Reports of short Argentine supplies and the apparent
unwillingness of the Chinese to sell at current world prices
may have caused Japanese buyers to turn to the United States
for corn supplies, the department said.

<DATELINE>    MILWAUKEE, WIS., April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Allis-Chalmers Corp said it is
deferring approximately three mln dlrs of interest payments due
March 31 and April 1.
    The company said it is actively negotiating with lenders
for concessions on a restructuring plan proposed March Four
calling for Allis-Chalmers to divest itself of all businesses
except the American Air Filter Co.
    Allis-Chalmers said it is "building a consensus among its
shareholders, retired employees and creditors" regarding the
consents that will be required for it to complete its
restructuring.
    To provide health care protection for its retired
employees, Allis-Chalmers said it proposed setting up a secure
75 mln dlr fund. It said about 4,400 current U.S. employees and
12,000 U.S. retirees are presently supported by Allis-Chalmers
health care plans.
    Allis-Chalmers in a statement said it planned to continue
payments to its vendors in the ordinary course of business
while the restructuring is being negotiated.
    Earlier, Allis-Chalmers said it executed a letter of intent
to sell its solids processing equipment and minerals systems
businesses to Boliden AB of Sweden for about 90 mln dlrs.

shareholders he would be presenting an alternative to the 100

<TITLE>MORGAN &lt;JPM> PLACES BRAZIL LOANS ON NONACCRUAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>J.P. Morgan and Co Inc, parent of
Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York, said that it will place
1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil on a
non-accrual basis, matching similar action by BankAmerica Corp
&lt;BAC> earlier today.
    The move, which follows Brazil's suspension of interest
payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt on February
20, is expected to reduce first quarter net income by about 20
mln dlrs, of which four mln dlrs represents interest accrued
prior to 1987 but still uncollected, the bank said.
    Morgan earned 233.9 mln dlrs in the first quarter of 1986.
    Morgan also said that, based on current interest rates and
assuming cash interest payments are not received for the rest
of the year, 1987 net income would be reduced by about 72 mln
dlrs. 1986 net income was 872.5 mln dlrs.
    Although U.S. banks do not have to put loans on nonaccrual
until they are over 90 days past due, Morgan said some of the
loans affected by the Brazil payment freeze may reach the
90-day limit during the second and third quarters.
    Morgan said it assumes talks between Brazil and commercial
bank lenders will proceed "expeditiously" and interest payments
will resume at the earliest practicable date.

a shareholder rights plan designed to fend off unwanted

    Morrison said that it was not aware of any party interested

    It said it declared a dividend on its outstanding common
stock of stock purchase rights which have a term of 10 years,
and will be issued April 10 to holders of record April 10.
    It said each right entitles shareholders to buy one
one-thousandth of a share of newly authorized preferred at a
purchase price of 75 dlrs. It said the rights will be
distributed as a dividend and will become exercisable if a
party acquires 20 pct or more of its common or begins a tender
offer for 30 pct or more of its stock, among other things.
    It said the rights are redeemable by its board at one-half

<TITLE>FRENCH SUBSIDIZED CORN FOR TUNISIA/MOROCCO-USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. corn sales to Tunisia, Morocco
and other North African countries may face increased
competition from European Community (EC) corn sales, the U.S.
Agriculture Department said.
    In its World Production and Trade report, the USDA said
sales of French corn for nearby delivery have been confirmed
with an export subsidy of about 145 dlrs per tonne, bringing
the French price to about 72 dlrs per tonne, FOB.
    While this is about the same price as U.S. corn, EC corn
has lower transport costs, the department noted.
    The French sales mark the beginning of commercial EC corn
exports which could reach 750,000 tonnes to North Africa and
the Middle East, areas which have traditionally purchased their
corn needs from the United States, the department said.
    Department officials said the 750,000 tonnes of exports are
for the year up to September 30 1987.
    They said export licenses for about 500,000 tonnes have
been issued so far.

<TITLE>NBC MAKES 'FINAL' OFFER TO WRITERS, TECHNICIANS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The National Broadcasting Co delivered
its "final offer" for a new contract to representatives of
2,800 writers, editors and technicians early today and waited
for a response.
    A committee of the National Association of Broadcast
Employees and Technicians discussed the offer but after three
hours they had not come to any decision.
    If the union walks out it would mean simultaneous strikes
against all three major U.S. television networks. A different
union struck CBS Inc &lt;CBS> and Capital Cities/ABC Inc &lt;CCB> a
month ago. NBC is owned by the General Electric Co &lt;GE>.
    "We're instructing all our members to continue working
without a contract," said John Krieger, a union official. The
contract expired at midnight March 31.
    Krieger said the committee is empowered to call a strike if
it sees fit but he added, "we're not gun shy and we're not
strike-happy, we don't take it lightly." He said the union
needed time to draft a formal response to the NBC proposal,
which the network billed as its "best and final offer."
    A spokeswoman for NBC said management personnel were
prepared to take assume technical duties if its radio and
television facilities are struck.
    "If there were a strike, we would not expect any
interruption in our service," the NBC spokeswoman said. At CBS
and ABC, where the Writers Guild of America has been on strike
since early March, viewers have noticed little difference in
the programs. However technicians are not involved in the
walkout at CBS and ABC.
    Krieger said the "major stumbling block" in the talks with
NBC was the network's insistence on having the right to hire
engineers and writers on a daily basis. "In a broad sense this
would decimate the union," he said, with temporary workers
jeopardizing the jobs of staff employees.
    NBC said its proposal "contains assurances that there is no
intention to replace regular employees with daily hires." NBC
said regular employees who may be on layoff would be offered
employment first.
    NBC also said any daily hires would be represented by the
union and would be phased in at four pct of regular staff in
the first year of a contract and six percent afterward.
    Top scale wages would increase to 855 dlrs per week in the
first year of the two-year contract and 895 dlrs in the second
year, under the NBC proposal. Krieger said the network's wage
proposals were "disappointing" but not the main issue.
    NBC said its proposals would give it greater flexibility in
sports and news coverage. It said its proposals would permit
limited access to news materials from affiliates and
subscription services and allow Cable News Network to join
network pool facilities. Cable News Network is owned by Turner
Broadcasting System &lt;TBS>.
    Material from subscription servoces would be limited to an
average of about one minute in a half-hour program, NBC said.
The network said the changes it seeks "would reduce costly
duplication and are vital to NBC's long term health."
    The major U.S. networks have experienced cost cutting
campaigns following a series of ownership changes that affected
the parent companies of all three in the past two years.
    Laurence Tisch became the largest shareholder in CBS, NBC's
former parent RCA was acquired by General Electric and ABC was
merged into Capital Cities Broadcasting.
    The broadcast operations have been hit with layoffs and
other belt-tightening measures. Network executives cited cable
television services and video cassette players which compete
for viewers.

amendments to a special resolution seeking shareholder approval
for authority to issue preference shares, so that the shares
will be non-voting except in the event of dividend non-payment.
    It said it proposed the amendments in response to
shareholder concerns that under the existing resolution, voting
rights could be attached to the preference shares that are
disproportionate to common share voting rights.
    Moore Corp said it has no immediate plans to issue
preference shares under the proposed resolution.
    The resolutions will be considered at the April 9 annual

<TITLE>MAJOR U.S. BANKS MOVE TO HIGHER 7-3/4 PCT PRIME</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Most major U.S. banks today matched
Tuesday's quarter-point prime rate cuts by Citibank and Chase
Manhattan Bank, the first prime rate boosts since mid-1984.
    Most cited narrower spreads between the prime and funding
costs as justification. Analysts said the prime rate rises may
have been triggered partly by a desire by banks to enhance
profit margins given problems with developing country loans. 
    Commenting on the prime rate increases, U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker told a House Appropriations Committee
that "I hope it was a temporary blip upward."
    Among the major banks which today announced prime rate
increases to 7-3/4 pct were Bankers Trust, Chemical Bank,
Continental Illinois National Bank, Harris Trust and Savings
Bank, Irving Trust, Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co, Marine
Midland, and Security Pacific National Bank.
    Other banking companies announcing prime rate rises
included Pittsburgh National Bank, Texas Commerce Bank-Houston,
Provident National Bank, First National Bank of Boston, Florida
Federal Savings and Loan Association, and SunTrust Banks.

<TITLE>FURTHER DECLINES IN U.S. DEBT FUTURES POSSIBLE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Brad Schade, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>After an already steep fall in the past
week, U.S. interest rate futures may be in for further declines
in the near term, financial analysts said.
    However, some analysts said recent sharp losses in bond
futures have left the bond market somewhat oversold, and the
contracts on long-term debt could stage a recovery before
resuming their decline.
    Key to the near-term direction of futures will be the
course of the dollar, they said.
    "As the dollar goes, so goes the bond market," said Dean
Witter analyst Karen Gibbs.
    The recent decline in the dollar, which hit a 40-year low
against the Japanese yen Monday, was reversed Wednesday when
several large U.S. money center banks unexpectedly raised their
prime lending rates by a quarter point, to 7-3/4 pct.
    "Even though the prime rate cut was good for the dollar,
foreign exchange traders are not convinced the dollar decline
is over," Gibbs said.
    The dollar decline was key in recent weakness in debt
futures as it rekindled concern about a pickup in inflation.
    Indeed, the falling dollar may have been a key topic at the
meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy making arm, the Federal
Open Market Committee, this week, analysts said.
    "To the Fed, the combination of a falling dollar, a
steepening yield curve, and rising commodity prices look
suspiciously like the traces of expectations of accelerating
inflation," said Denis Karnosky, analyst at Carroll, McEntee
and McGinley Inc.
    Such expectations could mean that "a shift in policy toward
restriction of bank reserves is likely to get very serious
consideration," at the FOMC meeting, he said.
    Any such restriction of reserves will not be a highly
visible form of monetary tightening, Karnosky said.
    Rather, the key to detecting a change will be found in
seasonal and adjustment borrowing at the discount window, he
said. Borrowings have held near a weekly average of 300 mln
dlrs over the past several months, he said.
    In the meantime, however, "the market looks a bit
oversold," said Jim Wysoglad, analyst at Golden Gate Futures.
    Wysoglad said a recovery from the oversold condition could
drive June bonds to a high near 99 before falling back to test
chart support near the recent low of 97-13/32.
    Technician Leslie Keefe of Technical Data Corp of Boston
said that the key test for June bonds will be whether the
nearby contract holds above chart support at 96-24/32.
    "All previous selloffs since mid-November have stopped and
buyers have surfaced at that level," Keefe said.
    If that level is broken, and the dollar continues to
decline, Keefe said she expects the June bond contract to
decline to test support between 92 and 93, the primary uptrend
line dating back to 1984.

<TITLE>COFFEE FUTURES AT SIX-YEAR LOW, UNDER 1 DLR/LB</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Coffee futures dipped further today and
closed below 1 dlr a pound for the first time in six years.
    Coffee for delivery in May ended at 99.28 cents a pound on
the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, down 0.76 cent and the
lowest price since August, 1981.
     Prices have been falling steadily since the International
Coffee Organization failed in February to reach an agreement
controlling exports by its members, and pressure was renewed
this week as the executive board of the organization met in
London without reopening debate on its export quotas.
    The executive board has limited its current discussions to
administrative matters and is set to adourn Thursday.
    Burdensome supplies have pressed the market down from 1.30
dlr a pound in February, when the organization's discussions
aimed at re-establishing export quotas broke down.
    Sandra Kaul, a coffee analyst in New York with Shearson
Lehman Brothers, said supplies currently are at their high
point for the year because most producing nations have just
completed their harvests.
    In addition, she said, many of those nations are faced with
serious debt and need to sell coffee to raise capital.
    "This should keep substantial pressure on exporters to
undertake sales despite the drop in prices," she said.
    Further, U.S. demand could be sluggish because winter, the
period of greatest consumption, is ending. Prices could fall
another 10 cents to 15 cnts a pound, analysts said.
    Gold futures retreated from modest early gains and closed
steady while silver prices rallied on the Commodity Exchange in
New York.
    The increase in U.S. banks' prime rates prompted concern
about renewed inflation, but the strength of the U.S. dollar
discouraged new buying.
    "The market is getting mixed signals and it doesn't know
which way to go," one analyst said.

<DATELINE>    BANGOR, Maine, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bangor Hydro-Electric Co said the
Maine PUblic Utilities Commission approved changes in rates
effective today that will decrease revenues by about 412,000
dlrs or 0.5 pct.
    The decrease results from changes in the base rates and in
the fuel cost adjustment rate charged by the company.
    Base rates will decrease by 6.25 mln dlrs due largely to
its sale in the Seabrook nuclear power project, a reduction in
federal income taxes and lower costs of capital.
    The base rate assumes a rate of return of 11.57 pct, down
from 13.1 pct. Offsetting the decrease, however, is an
authorization to increase fuel rates by 5.84 mln dlrs, it said.

<TITLE>COFFEE FUTURES UNDER DLR A POUND AT SIX-YEAR LOW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Coffee futures dipped further and closed
below one dlr a pound for the first time in six years.
    Coffee for delivery in May ended at 99.28 cents a pound on
the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, down 0.76 cent
and the lowest price since August, 1981.
     Prices have fallen steadily since the International Coffee
Organization failed in February to reach an agreement
controlling exports by its members, and pressure was renewed
this week as the executive board of the organization met in
London without reopening debate on its export quotas.
    The executive board has limited its current discussions to
administrative matters and is set to adourn Thursday.
    Burdensome supplies have pressed the market down from 1.30
dlrs a pound in February, when the organization's discussions
aimed at re-establishing export quotas broke down.
    Sandra Kaul, a coffee analyst in New York with Shearson
Lehman Brothers, said supplies currently are at their high
point for the year because most producing nations have just
completed their harvests.
    In addition, she said, many of those nations are faced with
serious debt and need to sell coffee to raise capital.
    "This should keep substantial pressure on exporters to
undertake sales despite the drop in prices," she said.
    Further, U.S. demand could be sluggish because winter, the
period of greatest consumption, is ending. Prices could fall
another 10 to 15 cents a pound, analysts said.
    Gold futures retreated from modest early gains and closed
steady while silver prices rallied on the Commodity Exchange in
New York.
    The increase in U.S. banks' prime rates prompted concern
about renewed inflation but the strength of the U.S. dollar
discouraged new buying.
    "The market is getting mixed signals and it doesn't know
which way to go," one analyst said.
    Cattle futures posted new highs on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, while live hogs rallied from early losses and frozen
pork bellies finished sharply lower.
    Cattle prices continued to draw support from the winter
storm that swept the Plains states, leaving animals stranded in
snowbound fields and feed lots in miserable condition.
    Live hogs were pressured early by the Agriculture
Department's report Tuesday that producers expanded their
breeding herds more than the market expected last quarter.
Prices recovered to keep pace with higher cash prices.
    Frozen pork bellies fell sharply on the outlook for greater
production and closed with limit losses.
    Soybean futures posted sharp gains on the Chicago Board of
Trade, while corn and wheat were lower.
    Soybeans rallied in response to Tuesday's USDA report that
farmers intend to plant 56.9 mln acres this year, down from
61.5 mln planted last year.
    Corn prices were pressured by the outlook for 67.6 mln
acres of corn, which is down from last year's 76.7 mln acres,
but was larger than analysts expected.

<TITLE>SIMON INDICTED IN WEDTECH &lt;WDT> CASE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Stanley Simon was charged with
extorting 50,000 dlrs from a defense contractor in the first
indictment in a corruption probe involving two Congressmen, a
former aide to President Reagan and other government officials.
    Simon, who resigned last month as Bronx Borough President,
was accused of extorting the money and forcing the now bankrupt
contractor, the Wedtech Corp., to hire his brother-in-law and
then give him raises.
    Simon is also accused of perjury and forcing one of his
employees to pay him 14,000 dlrs in salary kickbacks.
    He is the first public official to be indicted for
demanding money from Wedtech, a minority-owned company that
builds pontoon bridges for the Defense Department.
    "Wedtech was one of the success stories in the Bronx, but
the company was manipulated and raped," Thomas Scheer, the head
of the FBI's New York office, said of the payoffs the company
allegedly made to win contracts.
    Wedtech executives have said they paid bribes to about 20
government officials.
    Law enforcement sources say two Bronx congressmen, Mario
Biaggi and Robert Garcia, are under investigation.
    A special federal prosecutor has been appointed to
determine whether former Reagan aide Lyn Nofziger acted
improperly when he became a Wedtech consultant four months
after leaving the White House.
    Nofziger was given up to 1 mln dlrs in Wedtech stock.

<TITLE>UPI PRESIDENT RESIGNS AFTER FIVE MONTHS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>United Press International  announced
that Milton Benjamin had resigned as company president and the
news agency's chairman, Mario Vazquez-Rana, a Mexican newspaper
owner, would take over his duties.
    The agency, which emerged from bankruptcy court protection
when Vazquez-Rana bought it for 41 mln dlrs last June, has had
four presidents over the past year.
    Benjamin, who had served in the post since last November,
said he was stepping down because restoring UPI would take a
greater financial investment than he had envisaged and
Vasquez-Rana thus wished to take direct control.
    "In recent weeks, Mario (Vazquez-Rana) has indicated that in
light of the increased investment, he wants to devote even more
time to UPI and to play a more direct role in managing its
financial affairs," Benjamin said in a statement.
    Benjamin said he would return to his consulting firm of
Anderson, Benjamin, Read and Haney Inc., which he founded in
1984. He left the firm on November six last year to take over
as president of UPI.
    Besides Benjamin and Vazquez-Rana, the other presidents
have been Luis Nogales, a California businessman who helped
steer the agency through bankruptcy proceedings, and Maxwell
McCrohon, former editor and managing editor of the Chicago
Tribune.
    Vazquez-Rana, who is both chairman and chief executive
officer of UPI, is the publisher of a successful chain of 62
newspapers in Mexico, chairman of the Mexican Olympics
Committee and chairman of the worldwide Association of National
Olymnpics committees.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>U.S. HOUSE PANEL EXTENDS EEP, URGES USSR OFFER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, APRIL 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. House Agriculture Committee
approved proposals to extend the life of the Export Enhancement
Program, EEP, through fiscal 1990 and urged the Reagan
administration offer EEP wheat to the Soviet Union.
    The proposals were approved as amendments to a
comprehensive trade bill moving through Congress this year.
    In addition to the amendments on EEP, the committee
approved several proposals which could restrict imports of
lamb, casein, sugar-containing products and tobacco. Those
amendments affecting imports face an uncertain future because
the House Ways and Means Committee, which has overall
jurisdiction over trade legislation, will oppose them,
Congressional sources said.
    The effect of the EEP amendments would be to extend the
life of the program five years through fiscal 1990 rather than
the current three years through fiscal 1988.
    The amendments, offered by Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., also
would increase funding for the program to 2.5 billion dlrs from
1.5 billion now.
    Furthermore, the committee passed an amendment offered by
Rep. Glickman which instructs the U.S. Agriculture Department
to value EEP bonus commodities at market value, not acquisition
value. Glickman said the change would make the program 30 pct
less expensive to operate.
    The provision on EEP wheat to the Soviet Union, offered by
Rep. Bob Smith, R-Ore., does not require the administration
make an offer, but urges such action.
    The committee approved an amendment, offered by Rep. Glenn
English, D-Okla., requiring the Secretary of Agriculture to
begin discussions with other major grain producing countries
aimed at jointly reducing world grain production.
    Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter yesterday opposed the
amendment, saying such commodity agreements do not work.
    Among the host of amendments to restrict imports approved
by the panel, the most significant would require quotas on
imports of goods containing more than 25 pct of a bulk farm
product that is subject to U.S. quotas. The amendment, offered
by Rep. Arlan Stangeland, R-Minn., is aimed primarily at
curbing imports from Canada of products containing sugar and
foreign foods containing dairy products. It also may affect
peanut, cotton and tobacco imports, Committee sources said.
    Another amendment would place a quota on U.S. imports of
casein, a dairy product shipped to the U.S. primarily by New
Zealand and Ireland.
    The panel also voted to apply to lamb imports the same
countercyclical import quota law which is operating for U.S.
beef imports.
    Other miscellaneous amendments included:
    -- Urging the administration consider retaliating against
Japan and South Korea if those countries do not remove
restrictions on beef imports.
    -- Boosting the amount of U.S. grain which must be shipped
each year under a food aid program called Section 416 to
800,000 tonnes from 500,000 tonnes now.
    -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary conduct a study of
the Canadian Wheat Board import licensing system for wheat to
determine if it is a non-tariff trade barrier.
    -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary reimburse the
National Corn Growers Association up to 500,000 dlrs for the
costs of defending the U.S. feedgrains program against a
Canadian countervailing duty case this year.
    -- Urging the administration oppose the Canadian decision
to apply a duty on U.S. corn imports, and a proposal by the
European Community to apply a vegetable oils tax.
    -- USDA conduct a study of the findings of a National
Commission on Agricultural Export Policy, which recommended a
reorganization of USDA's trade policy apparatus.

Agriculture Department said.
    The department said no domestic poultry are involved in the
outbreak.
    State quarantines have been placed on the two facilities,

    The most serious U.S. outbreak of the disease occurred in
1971-73 in southern California, where the disease spread from
infected pet birds to a dense poultry population and nearly 12
mln birds, mostly laying hens, were destroyed at a cost of 56

    The reduction resulted from completion of an earlier

<TITLE>MANUFACTURERS &lt;MHC> PUTS BRAZIL ON NON-ACCRUAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Manufacturers Hanover Corp said it
placed 1.4 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to
Brazilian borrowers on non-accrual as of yesterday, meaning
that income will be recorded only when actual cash payments are
received.
    As a result, net income for the first quarter will be
reduced by 18 mln dlrs.
    If Brazil, which suspended interest payments on its term
debt on February 20, continues to defer interest payments for
the rest of the year, net income for the whole of 1987 would be
reduced by a total of 72 mln dlrs.
    U.S. bank accounting guidelines do not require loans to be
placed on nonaccrual unless interest payments are past due 90
days or more.  However, Manufacturers Hanover said that, in
light of current circumstances, it was more appropriate to
record income on its Brazilian loans only when cash payments
were received.
    It added that it believes Brazil will reach agreement with
its banks on a debt restructuring and that all interest
payments will be received later in 1987.
    The company earned 102.1 mln dlrs in first-quarter 1986 and
410.7 mln dlrs for the whole of the year.

<TITLE>DEUTSCHE BANK SEES SLOW START TO 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F> has seen a
slow start to 1987 after posting record profits in 1986,
management board joint spokesman F. Wilhelm Christians said.
    Credit business declined in the first few weeks of the
year, and the interest margin was squeezed further. The weak
German bourse saw earnings on commission fall sharply, and
trading in securities also fell. But earnings from currency
dealing were still satisfactory, he told a news conference.
    Deutsche group partial operating profits rose to 3.78
billion marks in 1986 from 2.92 billion in 1985 on a balance
sheet of 257.22 billion marks after 237.23 billion.
    Profits were swollen by earnings from the placement of the
former Flick group, which have been estimated at some one
billion marks, and from record profits in trading on the bank's
own account, not included in partial operating profits.
    Earnings from the Flick transaction were booked through a
subsidiary, and therefore showed up as part of the interest
surplus in a section current earnings from securities and
participations.
    In the group this nearly doubled to 2.64 billion marks from
1.45 billion.
    As usual the bank did not detail total operating profits.
    But it said that total operating profits, including own
account trading, rose 24.9 pct or 4.5 pct without the Flick
transaction in the group, and 35.1 pct or seven pct in the
parent bank.
    Banking analysts said this put group total operating
profits at some 6-1/2 to seven billion marks, and parent bank
operating profits at over five billion marks.
    Christians said Deutsche used the extraordinary earnings
from Flick to pay a record five mark bonus on top of its
unchanged 12 mark dividend.
    The bank had decided against raising the dividend itself
because of the uncertain business outlook at the end of 1986,
and developments so far this year showed that was correct,
Christians said.
    West German banks rarely raise dividends unless they are
sure they can maintain the increased payout in subsequent
years, preferring to use bonuses for one-of profits.
    The bank also used its extraordinary earnings to continue a
high level of risk provision, Christians said.
    Disclosed group risk provisions rose to 867 mln marks in
1986 from 765 mln in 1985.
    Under German law, disclosed provisions do not necessarily
reflect the full amount of risk provisions.
    Management board joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen said
Deutsche's total debt exposure to problem countries had fallen
to over six billion marks in 1986 from 7.4 billion in 1985
because of the fall in the dollar.
    He agreed with a questioner who asked if over two thirds of
such problem country debt had been written off.
    Deutsche Bank posted a sharp rise in holdings of "other
securities," to 4.64 billion marks from 2.71 billion in the
parent bank.
    Christians said this 1.93-billion-mark rise was partly due
to its increased activity in international share placements,
with some shares such as those from Fiat SpA's international
placement last year remaining on its books.
    Herrhausen said that no concrete measures were planned to
place these shares and conclude the original placement.

<TITLE>DEUTSCHE AGREES FULL TAKEOVER OF FORMER EURASBANK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F> has agreed
to take over the outstanding 25 pct in &lt;Deutsche Bank (Asia)
AG>, the former &lt;European Asian Bank AG>, from
Creditanstalt-Bankverein &lt;CABV.VI>, Deutsche management board
joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen told a news conference.
    Euras broke even in 1986 and required no funding from
Deutsche, he said. He gave no details of the deal with
Creditanstalt.
    Press reports that Deutsche was planning a takeover of
Lloyds Bank plc &lt;LLOY.L> were without foundation, he said.
    Herrhausen said Deutsche had taken part in the recent
capital increase of &lt;Morgan Grenfell Group plc>, but had no
plans to raise its 4.4 pct share in Morgan Grenfell.
    &lt;Banca d'America e d'Italia SpA>, in which 98.3 pct was
acquired from Bankamerica Corp &lt;BAC.N> late last year, would be
consolidated this year, and contribute to further expansion of
Deutsche's business, management board joint spokesman F.
Wilhelm Christians said.
    Following a ruling earlier this year from the Federal High
Court, Deutsche had included its non-bank holdings in the
balance sheet section "participations," Christians said.
    But Christians said the bank still regarded shares in these
non-bank companies as an investment rather than an active
participation.
    Parent bank total participations rose to 6.45 billion marks
in 1986 from a comparable 4.57 billion in 1985 including a rise
to 3.79 billion from 2.34 billion in bank participations.
    Herrhausen said the grouping of holdings in the balance
sheet in this was was not a first step to floating them off in
a separate holding company.

<TITLE>WORLD RECESSION UNLIKELY - DEUTSCHE'S HERRHAUSEN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>A world recession is unlikely this
year as fiscal and monetary policy in most industrialized
countries is supporting the economy, Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F>
management board joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen said.
    But growth rates will be smaller than last year, with 1.5
to 2.5 pct likely in most industrialized countries, he told a
news conference.
    Herrhausen said he was confident private consumption would
support economic growth in West Germany this year, with net
income increases turning into purchasing power as long as
inflation did not revive.
    Herrhausen said he did not expect interest rates to rise in
West Germany this year, but there was little room for further
falls. Rates in the U.S. were however rising, as evidenced by
the latest prime rate moves, but this rise would be moderate.
    Herrhausen said he did not expect any major narrowing of
the U.S. Trade and budget deficits in the next few months.
    One success of the Paris agreement in February to foster
currency stability was that U.S. Officials have stopped talking
down the dollar, he noted.
    The recent stability would last until markets decided to
test the resolve of central banks, he said.
    He noted that central banks had spent some 10 billion dlrs
this week to stabilize the dollar against the yen in the first
such test.
    "A massive attack on the mark, which could come if we get
bad news out of the U.S., Would require a much higher
intervention amount, raising the danger of inflation," he said.
    Turning to the international debt problem, Herrhausen said
Brazil's unilateral debt moratorium had surprised banks.
    But the move showed that a real solution to debt problems
was only possible with the involvement of all parties.

<TITLE>SINGAPORE BANKS SAY DIVERSIFICATION KEY TO GROWTH</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Tay Liam Hwee, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SINGAPORE, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Singapore's major banks are
diversifying and gradually shifting their asset holdings from
loans to debt instruments, banking sources said.
    The banks following the trend are the &lt;Overseas Union Bank
Ltd>, &lt;United Overseas Bank Ltd>, &lt;Oversea-Chinese Banking
Corporation> and the &lt;Development Bank of Singapore Ltd>.
    The shift towards securitisation has been helped by
volatile financial markets which have developed hedging
facilities such as floating rate notes and bonds for risk
management, said Overseas Union General Manager Loh Hoon Sun.
    Loh told Reuters in an interview that Singapore banks see
limited growth in credit risk. More and more of them are
switching from term lending to major growth areas such as
stockbroking and fee based income, he said.
    Major local banks ventured into stockbroking after being
granted seats on the stock exchange. Bankers said they are now
moving into the new government securities market and the Stock
Exchange of Singapore Dealing and Quotation System.
    One foreign banker said the Development Bank and the
Overseas Union Bank Ltd have become major players in the equity
market in Singapore.
    Loh said the banks' participation in the stock market has
increased business transactions and provided long term growth
for the market. The banks are not competition for individual
stockbroking firms because of the increased business they
generate, he added.
    Loh said the Stock Exchange of Singapore might expand
equity issues by as much as one billion dlrs this year because
of the increasing ability of foreign and local market
participants to absorb new issues.
    Loh said &lt;OUB Investment management Ltd>, a subsidiary of
the Overseas Union Bank Ltd, has teamed up with a U.K. Firm to
launch the Union Global Fund. The fund is for local investors
seeking capital growth through a diversified international
portfolio. It will invest in international shares with the
emphasis on U.S. And Japanese markets, he said.
    &lt;DBS Securities Singapore Pte Ltd>, a subsidiary of the
Development Bank of Singapore, has applied to the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange to set up a Hong Kong stockbroking firm.
    Loh predicted fixed deposit and prime interest rates in
Singapore will stay low this year. As a result, banks will be
forced to provide fund management services for major clients
seeking better returns, he said.
    Economic analysts and bankers are optimistic the major
banks will show profits in 1987, helped by higher income from
treasury and investment banking activities.
    They expect the 1987 after-tax profits of Oversea-Chinese
and United Overseas to show stable growth of four to eight pct
against respective gains of four and seven pct in 1986.
    Overseas Union's profits are expected to jump to over 40
mln dlrs from seven mln dlrs in 1986, economists said.
    The Development Bank's after-tax profits rose 39.2 pct in
1986 mainly due to a dividend of 20.4 mln dlrs paid by
&lt;National Discount Company Ltd> before it became a subsidiary
of the bank, they said.

said it will increase its indicator lending rate by 1.5
percentage points to 22.5 pct from April 7.
    Westpac said in a statement the increase reflects high
costs of funding.
    The bank said nervousness in the wholesale deposit market
is creating uncertainty about the immediate outlook for
interest rates. Liquidity is expected to remain tight over the
next month and this will put upward pressure on interest rates.
Base lending indicator rates of the other three trading banks
range between 21.0 pct and 21.5 pct.

<TITLE>THAI TRADERS OPPOSE REIMPOSITION OF COFFEE QUOTAS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BANGKOK, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Thai coffee exporters said they hoped
the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) would not reimpose
export quotas even though this may lead to a further slump in
world prices.
    Susin Suratanakaweekul, president of the Thai Coffee
Exporters Association, told Reuters that Thailand obtained
little benefit from previous ICO quotas which represented only
about 30 pct of its total annual exports.
    Thailand expects increased overall coffee export revenue if
there are no restrictions on sales to current ICO members who
offer higher prices than non-members, he said.
    The Customs Department said Thailand exported 21,404 tonnes
of coffee last year, up from 20,602 in 1985.
    Thai coffee production is projected to fall to about 25,000
tonnes in the 1986/87 (Oct/Sept) season from 28,000 the
previous year.
    However, a senior Commerce Ministry official said the Thai
government supports coffee producers' lobbying for reimposed
ICO quotas which, he said, would help lift world prices.
    Somphol Kiatpaiboon, director general of the Commercial
Economics Department, said an absence of ICO quotas would
encourage producers to rapidly release coffee on to the market,
further depressing prices.
    He said Indonesia is expected to export a substantial
amount of coffee this month without such restrictions.

<TITLE>SANWA BANK LOOKS TO SECURITIES, WORLD OPERATIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The &lt;Sanwa Bank Ltd's> three-year business
plan foresees securities and international operations making a
greater contribution to operating profits, a bank official
said.
    The bank's plan also emphasises retail and medium and
small-sized business operations, he told Reuters.
    Officials at &lt;Fuji Bank Ltd> and &lt;Mitsubishi Bank Ltd>
outlined similar three-year plans.
    They said lower interest rates and financial liberalisation
have cut profits from dealings with big firms to nearly
nothing.
    "They don't need us, they can do their own financing," one
official said.
    Sanwa Bank's plan forecasts that securities and
international operations will contribute 40 pct of total
operating profits by the end of the fiscal year ending March,
1990, compared with 30 pct in fiscal 1985, the Sanwa official
said.

<TITLE>JAPAN DENIES PLANS TO CUT DUTIES ON CHOCOLATE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Agriculture Ministry officials said they
are not considering cuts in import duties on chocolate to help
ease friction with the United States over agricultural trade.
    Japan has already lowered the duties sharply and we must
consider domestic market conditions, an official said.
    Duties on chocolate were cut to 20 pct from 31.9 pct in
April 1983.
    Washington has been demanding a cut to seven pct,
equivalent to its own duties, ministry sources said.
    Japanese chocolate imports rose to 8,285 tonnes in calendar
1986 from 5,908 in 1985, official statistics show.
    However, the ministry sources added it is possible the
government may make further cuts in response to strong U.S. And
European demand.
    "Due to concern about the farm trade row with the U.S.,
Top-level government officials may press the ministry to cut
the duties," one said.
    But he said it would be difficult for Japan to resolve its
overall trade row with Washington and reduce its trade surplus,
which reached 58.6 billion dlrs in 1986.
    Agricultural trade issues between Japan and the U.S.
Include Japanese import restrictions on 12 farm products.

<TITLE>INTERNATIONAL PACT ON OZONE DAMAGE LIKELY IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>An international protocol to severely
limit the use of industrial chemicals which are believed to
damage the earth's protective ozone layer could be signed this
year, officials and scientists here said.
    "By the end of this year, we should have an international
protocol in place we can all be proud of," U.S. Environmental
protection agency officer Bill Long told reporters.
    The chemicals are chiefly chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which
are used in refrigeration and making foam plastics, solvents
and aerosols. The earth's upper ozone layer absorbs most of the
harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun.
    The officials and scientists were meeting in Tokyo, ahead
of an international conference on the problem later this month
in either Vienna, or Geneva, Long said.
    Robert Watson, a program manager for atmospheric problems
at the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration said
a protocol should demand an initial freeze on the use of CFCs
by industry. This should be followed by a gradual reduction in
CFC volume until no CFC gases are released into the air, he
said. The U.S. Has already banned use of use CFCs in aerosols
and Japan has asked for voluntary restraint, but both still use
CFCs in industrial processes.

<TITLE>ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK TO OPEN INDONESIA OFFICE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     MANILA, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will
open an office in Jakarta later this year to speed up work on
Indonesian projects, bank Vice-President S. Stanley Katz said.
    "We have very large projects in Indonesia and we would like
to accelerate their implementation," Katz told Reuters.
    Indonesia is the largest recipient of ADB lending. It
received 118 loans worth 3.7 billion dlrs for 112 projects
between 1968 and 1986, 19.0 pct of the ADB's total lending.
Ordinary capital resources (OCR) lending to Indonesia was 3.6
billion dlrs, 27.1 pct of OCR loans at end-December 1986.
    Jakarta has also received loans worth 162 mln dlrs from the
bank's Asian Development Fund.
    ADB sources said Indonesia's cumulative disbursements at
end-1986 amounted to only 1.1 billion dlrs or 30 pct of loans
received. "Project implementation is very slow in Indonesia and
we are not very satisfied with the pace. We hope the new office
might help," Gunther Schulz, ADB Vice-President in charge of
projects, said.
    Planned projects were further slowed down in 1986 because
of the country's budgetary problems, he added. Indonesia's
revenue from oil exports was cut in half last year.
    "Decision making is quite slow, complicated and very
centralised," Schulz told Reuters.
    Indonesian President Suharto set up a high-level team in
July last year to speed up projects using ADB funds. ADB
sources said bank staff have been stationed intermittently in
Jakarta in response to government requests.
    The Jakarta office will be the third ADB office outside its
Manila headquarters. The bank has a resident office in Dhaka
and a South Pacific regional office in Vanuatu.

dlrs, and nervous over the implications for domestic interest
rates, further reducing the propects for a near term cut in
U.K. Bank base rates. The key three months interbank sterling

<TITLE>GERMAN INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT RISES 3.2 PCT IN FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German industrial production,
seasonally adjusted, rose a provisional 3.2 pct in February
after a downwards revised decline of 3.4 pct in January, the
Economics Ministry said.
    The ministry had originally estimated that industrial
production fell 3.0 pct in January.
    The February figure is likely to be revised upwards by just
under one percentage point next month when the March figure is
released, a ministry statement said.
    The industrial production index, base 1980, stood at a
provisional 104.1 in February against 100.9 in January and
104.5 in December. The ministry had previously put the January
and December indices at 101.6 and 104.7 respectively.
    In February 1986 the output index had stood at 103.7,
producing a year-on-year rise for February 1987 of 0.4 pct.
    The February rise in production was aided by a sharp 19 pct
increase in construction output compared with January, when
production in many industrial sectors was depressed by
unusually severe winter weather.
    Manufacturing industry registered a 3-1/2 pct rise in
production in February compared with January. But energy sector
output fell nine pct and mining production declined seven pct.
    The ministry, which considers two-monthly comparisons to be
a better guide to trends, said output in January and February
together fell around two pct against November and December.
    The ministry said construction output fell 13-1/2 pct in
January/February against November/December due to the cold
January weather. Output in the energy sector rose four pct and
mining output 10 pct.
    Manufacturing industry's production fell 1-1/2 pct in
January/February compared with November/December.
    Within this sector, the output of both basic products and
of food, tobacco and alcohol fell 1-1/2 pct. Production of
capital goods fell 2-1/2 pct while output of consumer goods was
unchanged.
    Compared with the same months of 1986, industrial
production in January and February 1987 fell 1-1/2 pct, the
ministry said.
    Manufacturing industry output fell one pct, with output of
basic products down three pct, capital goods down one pct and
food, tobacco and alcohol production 1-1/2 pct lower. Makers of
consumer goods posted a 1-1/2 pct year-on-year rise in the
two-month period.
    In other industrial sectors, mining production fell four
pct and construction output 4-1/2 pct. The energy sector saw a
slight 1/2 pct rise, the ministry added.

<TITLE>C AND W OFFERED ROLE IN NEW JAPAN TELECOM COMPANY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>A Japanese businessman announced plans for
a new telecommunications firm in which Britain's Cable and
Wireless Plc would be a core company.
    However, the plan, unveiled by senior Federation of
Economic Organizations official Fumio Watanabe, does not
specify what stake Cable and Wireless would have.
    "The share holdings of the core companies should be equal,"
Watanabe said in a statement. "The actual percentage of
shareholdings should be agreed by the core companies."
    He said the eight core companies will provide directors for
the firm.
    "The new company shall immediately set to work on the
feasibility study of constructing a new cable for itself,"
Watanabe said.
    Watanabe has acted as mediator between two rival groups,
one of which included C and W, seeking to compete against
&lt;Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd>, which now monopolizes Japan's
overseas telephone business.
    The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has said it wants
only one competitor to KDD and has backed Watanabe's efforts.
    A British source, who declined to be identified further,
said the proposals could open the door to further talks between
C and W &lt;CAWL.L> and the other firms involved.
    C and W had earlier rejected a reported proposal which
would have given it a five pct share in the new
telecommunications firm, compared to the less than three pct
stake Watanabe originally proposed. C and W has a 20 pct stake
in one of the two firms Watanabe has proposed should merge.
    The British source said the decision not to specify the
exact shareholdings of the core companies could leave the door
open for further discussion.
    "It's probably a sensible approach on their part," the
British source told reuters.
    C and W has also been pushing hard for permission to lay a
new cable between Japan and the U.S.
    The proposed merger has sparked an international row, with
British government sources threatening retaliatory action
against Japan for what they see as discriminatory practices
against foreign firms.
    The sources said last Friday that one option for Britain
would be to revoke licenses of Japanese banks and securities
companies operating in London.
    The U.S. Has also attacked the original merger plans,
saying that both rival consortia should be licensed.
    Asked about participation by other U.S. And European firms,
Watanabe said, "They will not be core companies but if they wish
they could participate." Under the Japanese law, total foreign
participation would be limited to one-third.
    "It might be wise for C and W to join the new firm which has
the support of many influential backers and work within this
for the realization of their ideas," Watanabe told reporters.
    The other core firms are Mitsubishi Corp &lt;MITT.T>, Mitsui
and Co &lt;MITS.T>, Sumitomo Corp &lt;SUMT.T>, Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co &lt;MC.T>, Toyota Motor Corp &lt;TOYO.T>, C Itoh and Co
&lt;CITT.T>, and &lt;Pacific Telesis International Inc>.
    Watanabe said that his latest proposal represented his
final effort.
    If it fails to satisfy the British government, it will be
up to the Japanese government to explain its position, he said.

<TITLE>BANK OF FRANCE TO BUY FIRST CATEGORY PAPER TODAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of France is to inject liquidity
against first category paper at a tender this afternoon, a Bank
spokesman said.
    Money market sources were divided as to whether they
thought the Bank of France would use the occasion to cut its
intervention rate, which has stood at 7 3/4 pct since it was
cut from eight pct on March 9.
    Some thought a rate cut unlikely given foreign exchange
turbulence and the U.S. Prime rate rise to 7 3/4 pct, while
others still counted on a 1/4 point cut by the Bank of France.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England said it forecast a
shortage of around 800 mln stg in the money market today.
    Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills for
repurchase by the market will drain some 664 mln stg while
bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury
bills will take out around 508 mln stg and a rise in note
circulation some 45 mln stg.
    Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions
and bankers' balances above target will add some 380 mln stg
and 35 mln stg to the system respectively.

<TITLE>RISING TAIWAN DOLLAR CAUSES FOREIGN RESERVES LOSS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Taiwan said its foreign reserves suffered
about 3.4 billion U.S. Dlrs in exchange rate losses from July
1986 to February 1987 as a result of the rise of the Taiwan
dollar against the U.S. Currency.
    Yu Chien-ming, head of the government statistics
department, told parliament yesterday he expected the losses to
increase as the Taiwan dollar continues to strengthen.
    The Taiwan dollar, which opened at 34.24 to the U.S. Dollar
today, has risen about 16 pct against the U.S. Unit since
September 1985. Some bankers expect it to rise to 33 by June
and to 32 by the end of this year.
    Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves now total 53 billion
dlrs. At end-February they were 52.1 billion dlrs, the world's
third largest after West Germany and Japan.
    Yu said the interest earned from the reserves totalled
about 1.68 billion U.S. Dlrs from July 1986 to February 1987.
The reserves are managed by the central bank and deposited at
about 170 leading banks in the U.S., Japan, Britain, Canada and
Singapore.
    About 75 pct of the reserves are in the form of cash,
mostly in U.S. Dollars. The rest are in government treasury
bills, certificates of deposit and bonds.

    Under the agreement, the EC will import two mln tonnes of

<TITLE>U.K. MONEY RATES FIRM ON LAWSON STERLING TARGETS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Interest rates on the London money market
were slightly firmer on news U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
Nigel Lawson had stated target rates for sterling against the
dollar and mark, dealers said.
    They said this had come as a surprise and expected the
targets, 2.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs, to be promptly tested in the
foreign exchange markets. Sterling opened 0.3 points lower in
trade weighted terms at 71.3.
    Dealers noted the chancellor said he would achieve his
goals on sterling by a combination of intervention in currency
markets and interest rates.
    Operators feel the foreign exchanges are likely to test
sterling on the downside and that this seems to make a fall in
U.K. Base lending rates even less likely in the near term,
dealers said.
    The feeling remains in the market, however, that
fundamental factors have not really changed and that a rise in
U.K. Interest rates is not very likely. The market is expected
to continue at around these levels, reflecting the current 10
pct base rate level, for some time.
    The key three months interbank rate was 1/16 point firmer
at 10 9-7/8 pct.

<TITLE>AWB CALLS FOR TIGHTER WHEAT QUALITY CONTROLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MELBOURNE, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Australia is risking wheat export
sales by not providing enough specific quality grades to meet
buyer requirements, the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) said.
    "Many AWB customers are becoming increasingly quality
conscious, demanding strict adherence to contractual quality
specifications," the board said in a submission to the Royal
Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport.
    "Many of the specifications are more specific than the
current categories used in Australia," it said.
    The commission is trying to identify ways of saving costs
and boosting efficiency of the grain handling system.
    Australia must rely on quality to retain its wheat market
share because its competitors are supplying cheaper but
lower-quality grades, the AWB submission said.
    It stressed the need to segregate wheat categories at every
stage from receival to shipping.
    Better industrial relations at grain terminals, more
uniform transport systems across the states and extensive stock
control were vital to improved marketing, it said.
    The submission also said Australia's federal system impeded
the AWB's role of coordinating and managing the marketing of
wheat.
    The AWB called for an end to physical and legislative
constraints at state borders that prevent the efficient
transport of grains to other states for shipment.
    "It is essential that wheat moves by the most economic mode
to the nearest efficient port, irrespective of the state in
which the wheat is grown or stored," it said.
    For example, wheat grown in northern New South Wales (NSW)
might move more efficiently to Brisbane, in Queensland, than to
Sydney or Newcastle in New South Wales, it said. Similarly,
southern NSW wheat might better be shipped to Portland or
Geelong, in Victoria.
    Legislation giving state rail authorities a monopoly over
grain shipments was one notable impediment, it said.
    The AWB said the current approach of state-based bulk
handling authorities is not essential, although it said it
favoured the authorities maintaining at least their current
level of control of storage and transport as long as quality
was maintained.
    An appendix on port loading costs showed it cost between
26,500 and 34,700 U.S. Dlrs to load a 50,000-tonne vessel at
various Australian ports compared with 21,200 dlrs at Houston
and 16,300 at Port Cartier, Quebec, for a 60,000-tonner.

<TITLE>JAPAN MINISTRY ASKS TRUST BANKS TO CUT DLR SALES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Finance Ministry has asked trust banks
to moderate their dollar selling, trust banking sources said.
    A Ministry official told Reuters earlier this week the
Ministry had recently surveyed foreign exchange transactions by
institutional investors, but he declined to say whether this
was aimed at moderating the dollar sales.
    Dealers said institutional investors were reluctant to sell
dollars aggressively today partly because of the Ministry
monitoring.
    One senior trust bank source said that while sympathizing
with the Ministry position, the trust banks had to conduct
their foreign exchange operations according to the dictates of
the market.
    A Bank of Japan official said the central bank approved of
the survey as long it was not used too forcefully.
    But another official denied local press reports that the
central bank itself had asked investors to moderate their
dollar sales. "We are not legally authorized to do that," he
said.
    A Bank of Japan official also said the central bank will
renew its call on financial institutions to moderate excessive
loans for the purpose of land and securities investment as such
investments threaten to cause inflation.
    Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita had previously
expressed concern about excessive investment in land and
securities resulting partly from eased credit conditions.

<TITLE>EC SUGAR TENDER SAID TO MARK NO CHANGE IN POLICY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The maximum rebate granted at
yesterday's European Community (EC) sugar tender marked no
change in policy towards producers' complaints that they are
losing money on exports outside the EC, EC commission sources
said.
    They said this was despite the fact that the commission
accepted over 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention
yesterday from traders protesting that rebates are being set
too low.
    The maximum rebate at yesterday's tender was 46.864 Ecus
per 100 kilos, up from 45.678 Ecus the previous week.
    London traders said yesterday the rebate was the largest
ever granted. The commission sources said today the increase
was entirely explained by world market conditions. The amount
by which the rebate fell short of what producers claim is
needed to obtain an equivalent price to that for sales into
intervention remained at 0.87 Ecus per 100 kilos, they said.
    Operators offered a total of 854,000 tonnes of sugar into
intervention last month to protest at rebates which they said
were too low. The sources said about 706,470 tonnes of French
sugar and 79,000 tonnes of German sugar had been accepted, the
remainder being rejected as of too low quality.
    The sources noted the operators could withdraw their offers
in the five week period between the acceptance of the sugar and
payment for it.
    They said they saw no sign of planned withdrawals as yet,
adding that they would expect operators to wait another week or
two to review commission policy before making up their minds.
    The sources said the commission felt entitled to offer
rebates at slightly below the level theoretically justifiable
in the light of its 1987/88 farm price package proposal to
reduce guaranteed prices for sugar by two pct from the start of
the new season in July.

<DATELINE>    NAIROBI, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Kenya's late coffee crop is flowering
well, but the main coffee areas were generally dry and hot in
the week ended Wednesday, trade sources said.
    "Machakos, Embu, Meru and Kirinyaga in eastern Kenya, and
Nyeri and Thika in central, have been dry in the past week. The
farmers expect rain this week. If it does not fall output of
the late (October-November-December) crop will decline sharply,"
one source said.
    He said that since most growers did not irrigate their crop
they could do nothing but wait for rain, the main factor which
determines Kenyan coffee production.
    Two months ago the International Coffee Organization issued
a forecast of Kenyan exportable coffee production in the
1986/87 (Oct-Sept) season at 1.82 mln bags.

<TITLE>U.K. GRAIN EXPORTS CONTINUE TO RISE SHARPLY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.K. Exported 517,600 tonnes of wheat
and 315,800 tonnes of barley in the first 25 days of March, the
Home Grown Cereals Authority (HGCA) said, quoting provisional
Customs and Excise figures.
    This brought combined wheat and barley exports since the
season started on July 1 to 7.60 mln tonnes, substantially up
on the 4.02 mln exported in the same 1985/86 period.
    This season's total comprises 3.94 mln tonnes of wheat and
3.66 mln barley, compared with 1.63 mln and 2.39 mln,
respectively, a year ago.

<TITLE>INDIA'S CREDIT POLICY AIMS TO CONTROL LIQUIDITY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW DELHI, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>India's credit policy package for
fiscal 1987/88 (April-March) will help ease inflationary
pressures and control the growth of overall liqudity, the
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in a statement.
    The package, announced earlier this week, will raise
commercial bank statutory liquidity ratios to 37.5 pct from 37
pct, effective April 25, and will increase cash reserve ratios
on foreign currency (non-resident) accounts to 9.5 pct from
three pct, effective May 23, it said.
    Excess liquidity pushed wholesale and consumer retail
prices higher in 1986/87 on previous year levels, RBI governor
R. N. Malhotra said in a statement.
    Malhotra said India's M-3 money supply grew 209.24 billion
rupees in the fiscal year to March 13, compared to a growth of
155.38 billion in the same period the year before.
    Commercial bank aggregate deposits rose to 164.10 billion
in the same period, against 120.66 billion in the corresponding
months of fiscal 1986/87, he said.
    The Finance Ministry in a report issued in February
predicted India's fiscal 1986/87 wholesale price-linked
inflation rate at about 6.5 pct against 3.8 pct in 1985/86.

<TITLE>BAYER CONFIDENT OF POSTING GOOD 1987 RESULTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LEVERKUSEN, West Germany, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chemicals group Bayer
AG &lt;BAYG.F> said it expects to post another good result in 1987
after raising pre-tax profit to a new record high in 1986.
    The company said that this was despite the mark's further
strengthening against the dollar and other currencies and
despite an increase in competitive pressure.
    "The further progress of our business will depend largely on
the extent to which threats to free trade materialise and on
the developments of exchange rates, raw material and energy
costs.
    Bayer said world group pre-tax profit rose to 3.30 billion
marks in 1986, exceeding the previous year's record of 3.15
billion. Parent company pre-tax profit increased to 1.72
billion from 1.62 billion.
    The company gave no net profit figures or any indication of
the likely 1986 dividend. Bayer paid a 10-mark dividend on 1985
results, up one mark from a year earlier.
    Bayer said that world group operating profit declined
slightly in 1986 against 1985 but non-operating results showed
a further improvement.
    Bayer said that the decline in world group turnover to
40.75 billion marks from 45.93 billion in 1985 reflected mainly
the sharp fall in the dollar against the mark.
    Lower prices on the raw material side had also brought
pressure on selling prices, it added.
    In volume terms, however, 1986 sales rose slightly against
1985, the company said without giving details.
    "The western Europe, North America and Far East regions
developed well in local currency, but here too the translation
of local currency sales into marks distorted the picture,
especially in the case of North America," it said.
    Bayer said parent company volume sales were also higher in
1986, although turnover fell 4.3 pct to 16.77 billion marks.
    Capacity use was high at the parent company in 1986,
resulting in a decline in marginal unit costs. This, combined
with savings in raw material and energy costs, helped offset
falling prices and cost increases in other areas.
    The rise in pre-tax parent company profit was due to lower
extraordinary expenses and higher net interest income.
Plastics, organic chemicals, polyurethanes and coating raw
materials all developed well, it said.
    Turning to the 1986 fourth quarter, Bayer said that world
group turnover fell to 9.67 billion marks in the last three
months of 1986 from 10.43 billion in the same 1985 period.
    Parent company turnover in the fourth quarter fell 7.1 pct
to 3.69 billion marks, with domestic turnover 4.1 pct lower and
foreign turnover 8.6 pct lower.
    Exports accounted for 65.3 pct of turnover in the quarter
against 66.4 pct in the same quarter of 1985.

<TITLE>NEW SINGAPORE FINANCIAL MARKET SET TO OPEN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jose Katigbak, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SINGAPORE, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The new Singapore government
securities market will start trading in late April or early May
after President Wee Kim Wee signs the Development Loan Bill
approved by parliament last week, bankers said.
    But the new market is unlikely to attract many overseas
investors, particularly as non-residents will be subject to a
withholding tax on interest earned, Loh Hoon Sun, general
manager of &lt;Overseas Union Bank Ltd>, said.
    Overseas Union Bank Ltd is one of the five primary dealers
approved to underwrite the auctions and ensure liquidity.
    The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), which approved
the five underwriters, aims to issue seven billion dlrs of
treasury bills, notes and bond issues in the first year.
    A MAS spokesman said a steering committee has yet to
determine details, but most of the new government securities
will have a maturity of up to five years and 10-year paper may
be issued if demand emerges. Bonds and treasury bills will be
issued in denominations of 1,000 dlrs and treasury bills in a
minimum denomination of 10,000 dlrs.
    Bankers said these rates will put the securities within
reach of almost everyone and will create a more active market.
    Allocations will be made first for non-competitive bids
from primary dealers prepared to accept average yields on up to
500,000 dlrs worth of notes and bonds and an unlimited volume
of treasury bills. The remainder will be awarded to competitive
bidders offering the lowest yields.
    The new market should stimulate the local economy. Funds
will come from savings and fixed deposit accounts, "but just how
much will depend on the bond yields," Loh told Reuters.
    Loh said bank interest rates currently stand at 3.0 to 3.5
pct for fixed deposits and the prime rate is 5.5 pct, and these
rates are expected to remain fairly steady this year.
    An act of parliament passed last week granted the Singapore
authorities permission to raise 35 billion dlrs in the new
market over the next four years.
    Trading will be computerised and scripless.

<TITLE>U.K. RESERVES SHOW LARGE UNDERLYING RISE IN MARCH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Britain's gold and currency reserves
showed an underlying rise of 1.785 billion dlrs in March after
a 287 mln dlr rise in January, the Treasury said.
    This was considerably above market expectations for a 650
mln dlr rise.
    The underlying trend, which is a guide to Bank of England
operations to support the pound on foreign exchanges, is net of
borrowings and repayments.
    The Treasury declined comment on the figures. Last month it
said the Bank of England took the opportunity of strong demand
to rebuild reserves after losses last autumn.
    Actual reserves rose by 1.89 billion dlrs, after rising 305
mln in February, to 22.26 billion. Total reserves were revalued
to 27.04 billion dlrs, but would have totalled 24.15 billion
under the previous valuation, the Treasury said. Gold reserves
were revalued by 895 mln dlrs, while SDRs, ECU and convertible
currency holdings were revalued by 1.995 billion.
    Accruals of borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were
361 mln dlrs last month, after 36 mln in February. Repayments
were 240 mln dlrs after the previous 16 mln. Capital repayments
totalled 14 mln dlrs, after February's two mln dlrs repayment.

probably fall to less than 630,000 tonnes in 1986/87 (May-Apr),
from 918,000 last year, because of poor rainfall in major
producing areas, Agriculture Minister Kingsley Chinkuli said.
    He told Parliament that in the southern provinces the
harvest would be over 50 pct down on the level in the previous
marketing year.
    "The nation would be lucky to produce over seven mln bags
(630,000 tonnes) of maize this year," he stated.
    Chinkuli added that Zambia was setting up an irrigation
fund with Canadian aid to lessen the effects of poor rainfall.

<TITLE>ZAMBIAN CENTRAL BANKER CRITICISES IMF POLICIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUSAKA, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bank of Zambia general manager Michael
Mwape has accused the International Monetary Fund of ignoring
social conditions when drawing up its economic reform
programmes for African countries.
    Mwape said in a speech to businessmen in the southern town
of Livingstone yesterday that the IMF's approach had caused
social and political unrest across the continent.
    There was widespread rioting and looting in Zambia last
December after the government abolished subsidies on refined
maize meal in line with IMF recommendations.
    Mwape said told businessmen "The question which should be
asked and answered when designing programmes is who is going to
bear the brunt of adjustment ... And what cushion is available
to minimise the burden ?"
    Zambia has had five IMF adjustment programmes since 1976,
the last of which was cancelled in February last year, he said.
"In spite of these, the economy has shown signs of stress, with
no significant improvement in a number of areas," he added.
    Zambia has just completed a new round of IMF talks on its
foreign exchange system and has obtained enough commercial
loans to pay off its IMF arrears for 1985 and 1986, paving the
way for a new stand-by credit.
    Zambian politicians have frequently criticised the fund,
however, and diplomats say President Kenneth Kaunda faces
consistent opposition inside the ruling party's central
committee over dealings with the IMF.

<TITLE>INDUSTRIAL ACTION ENDS AT SOUTH AFRICAN MINE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JOHANNESBURG, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>About 8,000 black miners returned
to work after a week-long industrial action at South Africa's
largest gold mine, mine owner Anglo American Corp of South
Africa Ltd &lt;ANGL.J> said.
    A spokesman for the mining house said the action started on
Wednesday last week when thousands of miners staged a go-slow
at One underground shaft of the Free State Geduld division of
Free State Consolidated Gold Mines Ltd &lt;FSCN.J>.
    The action later escalated into an underground sit-in at
the mine over the weekend, prompting management to close the
affected shaft because of what the company described as "the
creation of unsafe working conditions."
    Anglo American spokesman John Kingsley-Jones said the
company held talks with the National Union of Mineworkers
(NUM), South Africa's biggest trade union which claims a
membership of 360,000 black workers, but failed to establish
the cause of worker dissatisfaction. He acknowledged that the
mine suffered a loss of production, but declined to give
estimates.
    Free State Consolidated last year produced 104 tonnes of
gold from 28 underground shafts.
    The NUM was not immediately available for comment on the
action. But a spokesman for the union earlier told the South
African Press Association that miners had been locked out of
the mine at the weekend after staging a strike in protest
against being ordered to carry bags containing explosives as
well as food for white miners.

<TITLE>COMPROMISE CITED ON SAN MIGUEL SHARES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;San Miguel Corp>, SMC, and &lt;United
Coconut Planters Bank>, UCPB, have reached a compromise on a
disputed block of 38.1 mln shares of SMC, the head of a
government panel that controls the sequestered shares said.
    Ramon Diaz, Chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good
Government (PCGG) told Reuters SMC had offered a price of 126
pesos per share for the block, held in trust by the UCPB.
    "It looks good," Diaz said. But he added several issues,
including the identity of the ultimate buyers of the shares,
had to be resolved before the PCGG gave its approval to the
sale.
    The PCGG's sequestration last year of 33 mln shares aborted
SMC's bid to buy them back from 14 trading companies in the
UCPB group. The commission said it suspected the shares were
actually controlled by Eduardo Cojuangco, an associate of
former President Ferdinand Marcos.
    Cojuango, who headed the boards of both SMC and UCPB when
he fled last year after Marcos was toppled, personally owned 24
mln shares in SMC. His holdings are also under sequestration.
    "The shares that SMC now proposes to buy from the UCPB are
owned by 1.4 mln coconut farmers," Diaz said. "Naturally we do
not want them to go back into the hands of Marcos cronies."
    PCGG sources said a compromise would end a row over a down
payment of 500 mln pesos made by SMC's Hong Kong subsidiary
Neptunia Corp Ltd in a bid to buy back the shares last year.
    The UCPB had said the 500 mln peso payment would be
forfeited because SMC Chairman Andres Soriano III had failed to
fulfil his commitment to buy back the shares at an originally
negotiated price of 3.3 billion pesos.
    PCGG sources said SMC, the Philippines' largest food and
beverage manufacturer, has agreed to sell 14 mln "B" class shares
from the 38.1 mln shares to Australian brewer Alan Bond at a
price of 150 pesos per share.
    The PCGG sources said of the proposed 4.79 billion peso
transaction, 1.6 billion pesos would be offset against the 500
mln peso down payment, the 500 mln pesos worth of preferred
shares in UCPB held by SMC, 210 mln pesos in uncollected
dividends on the UCPB shares and 400 mln pesos advanced to
UCPB-controlled trading companies.
    The UCPB rejected an original offer of 100 pesos per share
made by SMC for 33 mln shares, which grew to 38 mln after a 15
pct stock dividend declared in June last year.
    A spokesman for SMC said the company's 15-member board met
today to discuss the proposed compromise.
    The spokesman declined comment on the outcome of the board
meeting, saying the dispute was under arbitration.
    President Corazon Aquino last month asked SMC and UCPB to
set up a three-man arbitration panel to resolve the ownership
issue. The panel is due to submit its report by April 15.
    Eduardo de Los Angeles, a government nominee in the SMC
board, filed a formal complaint before the Securities and
Exchange Commission last week, accusing Soriano and eight other
directors of violating "fiduciary duty."
    De Los Angeles was said to have opposed a decision by SMC's
board last December to assume the 500 mln peso Neptunia loan.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>LAWSON REMARKS DASH HOPES OF EARLY U.K. RATE CUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson's remarks yesterday suggesting there are precise
exchange rate targets for the pound undermined sterling,
dashing hopes for an early cut in U.K. Base rates, analysts
said.
    But the market's reaction, testing exchange rate levels
indicated by Lawson, was probably overdone and the longer term
outlook for sterling remained bullish, they agreed.
    In an apparent break with the previous policy of secrecy,
Lawson told a National Economic Development Council meeting he
was comfortable with sterling exchange rates around current
levels, specifying rates of around 1.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs.
    Lawson added the U.K. Government intended to keep sterling
at about present levels, using currency intervention and
interest rates to achieve this.
    The February 22 Paris agreement of the Group of Five and
Canada to stabilise exchange rates is widely believed to
include target ranges, but all participants to the meeting had
so far refused to specify these.
    Markets were quick to react to the statement, chopping
about one U.S. Cent and over one pfennig off the pound to match
the levels mentioned by Lawson.
    But most analysts polled said they did not believe Lawson's
statement signalled a change in U.K. Policy.
    Keith Skeoch, chief economist at stockbrokers James Capel
and Co, said, "the remarks have been blown out of proportion.
Lawson is paying now for a little bit of a slip of the tongue."
    Barclays de Zoete Wedd economist Mark Brett said, "there is
nothing great and fantastic in the Chancellor's statement."
    He said he did not believe the rates indicated by the
Chancellor were precise targets, but merely represented central
rates around which sterling would be allowed to fluctuate,
perhaps by as much as 10 pct.
    "It would be insane to pinpoint an exchange rate ahead of an
election ... I don't believe Lawson is mad enough to tie
himself to a fixed rate," Brett said.
    Currency markets were keen for official statements to
clarify the scope of the Paris accord and reactivate currency
trading. This mood easily led to over-reaction, analysts said.
    "Making similar statements when the market is high strung
and ready to bounce is perhaps a mistake," one senior dealer
with a U.S. Bank said.
    Capel's Skeoch said, "it gives the foreign exchange markets
something to shoot at."
    "It is obvious that the government, as a member of the Group
of Six, has agreed exchange rate bands. But they are not cut in
stone, they can change with time," Skeoch said.
    Brett said, "we think the 2.90 marks level is a central
rate. Give or take 10 pfennigs and all is fine."
    Not all analysts played down the significance of the
remarks, however. Chris Dunn, economist at Royal Bank of
Canada, said the remarks may signal a decisive move to insulate
sterling from the fortunes of the dollar.
    Although about two-thirds of Britain's trade is conducted
with European countries, sterling has traditionally shadowed
the dollar rather than the mark, analysts noted.
    "Britain must decide whether it wants to follow the U.S. Or
throw in its lot with Europe," Dunn said.
    "It suggests that while the U.K. Is not actually applying to
join the European Monetary System, it is seeking protection by
shadowing it ... The Bundesbank has made it clear that it wants
the U.K. To clarify its position relative to the mark," he said.
    Analysts said sterling's dip on currency markets following
Lawson's remarks made an early half-point cut in U.K. Base
rates from current 10 pct levels unlikely in the short term.
    "Over the next three weeks, a cut is out, unless we get some
extremely good economic indicators," Capel's Skeoch said.
    Base rates have been cut twice by one-half point in March,
the last after the March 17 budget presentation, and analysts
had been expecting another half point cut shortly afterwards.

<TITLE>RANK MAKES INCREASED AVANA OFFER FINAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ranks Hovis McDougall Plc &lt;RHML.L> said
it was making an increased and final offer for the Avana Group
Plc &lt;AVNA.L>. The company already holds about 22.9 pct or 7.1
mln Avana ordinary shares.
    It said in a statement the terms of the offer will be 13
new Rank Hovis shares for every five Avana ordinary shares,
valuing each Avana share at 829p.
    Avana shareholders will be entitled to receive and retain
the net interim dividend of 5.25p per Avana share for the year
ending 28 March 1987.
    Accepting Avana shareholders will also be entitled to
receive Ranks Hovis's forecast net interim dividend of 2.65p
for the financial year ending 5 September 1987.
    Ranks Hovis said that full acceptance of the increased
offer would result in the issue of a maximum of 72.3 mln new
Ranks Hovis shares or about 20 pct of the enlarged issued
ordinary share capital of the company.
    The latest offer will lapse on 17 April. Ordinary
shareholders in Avana who accept the increased offer will have
the opportunity to elect for cash for all or part of their
holdings on the basis of 800p cash for each Avana share.
    Ranks Hovis said the cash required for the cash alternative
would be met by one of several methods.
    For the first 10 mln Avana shares received opting for the
cash alternative, Ranks Hovis would make a cash payment from
its own resources.
    For cash alternatives of more than 10 mln Avana shares,
Morgan Grenfell, as agent for participants, will make a
separate offer to purchase at 300p per share, net of expenses,
up to 46.3 mln Ranks Hovis new shares to which such
shareholders will be entitled under the increased offer. This
is equivalent to 780p per Avana ordinary.
    In addition, Ranks Hovis will make a further cash payment
of 20p per Avana ordinary. Avana shares traded at 800p after
the announcement, 32p up from last night's close of 768p. REUTER

<TITLE>CABLE UNIMPRESSED BY NEW JAPANESE TELECOMS OFFER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L> said new
proposals unveiled by Japan for it to become a core member of a
merged telecommunications firm to compete for
telecommunications contracts did not remove the group's
objections.
    The suggestions by Federation of Economic Organisations
official Fumio Watanabe was a formal announcement of proposals
made earlier this week and reported in the Japanese press.
    Cable has a 20 pct stake in one of the two groups trying to
compete against Japan's &lt;Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd> which
monopolises Japan's overseas telephone business.
    But a Cable spokesman said it still believed a merger of
the two consortia would be impracticable. "They are like oil and
water," he said.
    The Japanese authorities want only one competitor and have
proposed that the two consortia band together. The issue has
been taken up by the British government as a test case on the
openness of Japanese markets. Watanabe's latest proposals said
that the eight core companies of the new group should have
equal share holdings but added that they could work out the
precise percentages amongst themselves.
    The reports earlier this week said that Cable would be
offered a five pct stake, up from an originally proposed three
pct.
    Despite the apparent differences in stakes offered, the
Cable spokesman said the two offers appeared to be essentially
the same.
    Cable shares at 1100 GMT were quoted nine pence firmer at
374p.

<TITLE>JAPAN/U.S. WILL BE AT ODDS WHILE TRADE LOPSIDED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan is doing all it can to solve its
trade problems with the United States but the two nations will
remain at odds as long as the trade account is lopsided in
Japan's favour, a senior official said.
    "So long as there is an external imbalance there will be
trade friction and ...Harsh words between the two governments,"
the Foreign Ministry official told reporters.
    Last year, Japan racked up a 51.5 billion dlr surplus with
the United States and economists said they do not see it
falling significantly any time soon.
    Washington announced plans last week to slap up to 300 mln
dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods, raising the
spectre of a trade war between the two countries.
    "We take the current situation very seriously," said the
official, who declined to be identified. "The basic stance of
the Japanese government is to tackle the issues with all
available resources."
    The United States has accused Japan of reneging on an
agreement that called on it to stop selling cut-price computer
microchips in world markets and to try to import more American
semiconductors. Tokyo has denied the charges.
    The Foreign Ministry official refused to rule out Japanese
retaliation if America went ahead with its threatened tariffs
in the middle of this month. But he said that any response
would be in accordance with international law and Japan's
international obligations.
    He added that both Japan and the United States must take
account of the impact of their dispute on their own and the
world economy.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.K. Defence secretary George Younger is
expected to announce the government's decision on the sale of
state-owned arms manufacturer &lt;Royal Ordnance> today,
parliamentary sources said.
    The government originally intended to float the munitions
and explosives concern on the stock market, but last July said
a private sale was a more appropriate way to dispose of the
firm.
    The bidders for the company were British Aerospace Plc
&lt;BAEL.L> and engineering group GKN Plc &lt;GKN.L>. Royal Ordnance
sold its Leeds tank factory last summer to Vickers Plc
&lt;VICK.L>.
    Defence electronics manufacturer Ferranti Plc &lt;FNTI.L> and
shipping and property group Trafalgar House Plc &lt;THSL.L> both
pulled out of the bidding shortly before last month's deadline.
    Royal Ordnance made pre-tax profits of 26 mln stg on sales
of 487 mln stg in calendar 1985, its first full year of
commercial operation. The company has assets of around 240 mln
stg and employs 17,000 at 15 sites in Britain.
    Other state-held companies earmarked for privatisation this
year include engine maker &lt;Rolls Royce Plc> and the &lt;British
Airports Authorities Plc>.

<TITLE>JAPANESE GROUPS URGE DRASTIC ECONOMIC PACKAGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's leading economic organisations
urged the Government to prepare drastic pump-priming measures
even at the cost of shelving Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's
planned tax reforms, officials involved said.
    Officials of the Federation of Economic Organisations
(Keidanren) said in a meeting with government officials the
Government should issue construction bonds as an emergency
measure to prop up the economy.
    Keidanren suggested that proceeds from sales of stocks in
the newly-privatised Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp should
also be used to stimulate the economy.
    Keidanren Chairman Eishiro Saito said the dollar's fall
below 150 yen would create huge unemployment and bankruptcies
that could shake the foundation of the Japanese economy.
    The Keidanren meeting coincided with a written request for
drastic reflationary measures sent to the Government by the
Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
    Both organisations called for stepped-up Bank of Japan
intervention to stabilise exchange rates.
    Chamber head Noboru Gotoh told a press conference the
awaited economic package should be powerful enough to push up
Japan's Gross National Product (GNP) by about two pct.
    Gotoh said the Government could cope with the present
critical economic condition even if it put off its plan to stop
the issue of deficit-covering bonds by fiscal 1990.
    The plan to reduce the fiscal budget is a pillar of
Nakasone's fiscal reconstruction program.

<DATELINE>     IJMUIDEN, The Netherlands, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Koninklijke
Nederlandsche Hoogovens en Staalfabrieken NV> said it expected
a "clear loss" for 1987.
     The company reported its 1986 profits were 44 pct lower at
154.6 mln guilders than in the year before.
     Turnover was 18 pct lower than in 1985.
     The main reason fo the fall in turnover was the lower rate
of the dollar, the company said. The lower costs for raw
materials and energy, resulting from the lower dollar, could
not compensate the fall in revenues.
     Costs 5.61 billion guilders vs 6.66 billion
     Depreciation 457 mln vs 493 mln

<TITLE>GERMAN INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT RISES 3.2 PCT IN FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German industrial production,
seasonally adjusted, rose a provisional 3.2 pct in February
after a downwards revised decline of 3.4 pct in January, the
Economics Ministry said.
    The ministry had originally estimated that industrial
production fell 3.0 pct in January.
    The February figure is likely to be revised upwards by just
under one percentage point next month when the March figure is
released, a ministry statement said.
    The industrial production index, base 1980, stood at a
provisional 104.1 in February against 100.9 in January and
104.5 in December. The ministry had previously put the January
and December indices at 101.6 and 104.7 respectively.
    In February 1986 the output index had stood at 103.7,
producing a year-on-year rise for February 1987 of 0.4 pct.
    The February rise in production was aided by a sharp 19 pct
increase in construction output compared with January, when
production in many industrial sectors was depressed by
unusually severe winter weather.
    Manufacturing industry registered a 3-1/2 pct rise in
production in February compared with January. But energy sector
output fell nine pct and mining production declined seven pct.
    The ministry, which considers two-monthly comparisons to be
a better guide to trends, said output in January and February
together fell around two pct against November and December.
    The ministry said construction output fell 13-1/2 pct in
January/February against November/December due to the cold
January weather. Output in the energy sector rose four pct and
mining output 10 pct.
    Manufacturing industry's production fell 1-1/2 pct in
January/February compared with November/December.
    Within this sector, the output of both basic products and
of food, tobacco and alcohol fell 1-1/2 pct. Production of
capital goods fell 2-1/2 pct while output of consumer goods was
unchanged.

<TITLE>TOSHIBA REGRETS LINK WITH U.K. ACCESS ISSUE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T> said it regrets its
plan to enter the U.K. Business facsimile and telephone market
may be caught up in a diplomatic row over the position of Cable
and Wireless Plc's &lt;CAWL.L> in the Japanese market.
    Britain is considering how to retaliate against Japan's
attempt to prevent Cable and Wireless from taking a major
position in a Japanese international telecommunications
venture.
    "As a matter of timing it is regrettable that this has been
linked with the question of market access in Japan," a Toshiba
spokesman told Reuters.
    &lt;Toshiba Information Systems (U.K.) Ltd>, a Toshiba
subsidiary, said yesterday it planned to enter the U.K. Market
under the Toshiba own brand name and had applied for government
approval to do so.
    Toshiba has supplied equipment to U.K. Manufacturers for
sale under their brand names since last year.
    The Toshiba spokesman said the sale of such equipment was
not comparable to Cable and Wireless' efforts to take a stake
in the new Japanese telecommunications firm.
    "They are matters of a different category," he said.

    Westpac said in a statement the increase reflects high
costs of funding.
    The bank said nervousness in the wholesale deposit market
is creating uncertainty about the immediate outlook for
interest rates. Liquidity is expected to remain tight over the
next month and this will put upward pressure on interest rates.
Base lending indicator rates of the other three trading banks
range between 21.0 pct and 21.5 pct.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>JAPAN WARNS OF ANTI-U.S. SENTIMENT IN TRADE ROW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan is sending a three-man team to
Washington to try to halt threatened trade sanctions that
officials warn could spark a wave of anti-U.S. Sentiment here.
    The team will lay the groundwork for high-level emergency
talks next week aimed at defusing an increasingly bitter row
over trade in computer microchips, officials said.
    "The sanctions are against the free trade system," Ministry
of International Trade and Industry (MITI) director general
Noboru Hatakeyama told reporters, adding: "If these measures are
taken, the atmosphere in Japan against the United States would
become not so good as before."
    Other officials were more blunt. "The U.S. Action will have
a significant impact on the growing anti-U.S. Feeling (here),"
another MITI official said.
    A senior Foreign Ministry official, who declined to be
identified, told Reuters the U.S. Threats have undercut those
in the government who argue for conciliation.
    "There is a very strong argument in Japan that since the
United States is imposing tariffs unilaterally, why should we
bother doing anything," he said. "Anything we do, we will be
bashed."
    The senior official sounded pessimistic about the
likelihood of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone defusing U.S.
Anger over Japanese trade practices when he visits Washington
on April 29.
    "I don't think trade friction will be solved all of a sudden
(by the visit)," he said.
    Nakasone is widely expected to present a package of
measures to President Reagan to help contain U.S. Frustration
over Japan's large trade surplus.
    But the senior official played down those expectations.

<TITLE>JAPAN/U.S. WILL BE AT ODDS WHILE TRADE LOPSIDED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan is doing all it can to solve its
trade problems with the United States but the two nations will
remain at odds as long as the trade account is lopsided in
Japan's favour, a senior official said.
    "So long as there is an external imbalance there will be
trade friction and ...Harsh words between the two governments,"
the Foreign Ministry official told reporters.
    Last year, Japan racked up a 51.5 billion dlr surplus with
the United States and economists said they do not see it
falling significantly any time soon.
    Washington announced plans last week to slap up to 300 mln
dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods, raising the
spectre of a trade war between the two countries.
    "We take the current situation very seriously," said the
official, who declined to be identified. "The basic stance of
the Japanese government is to tackle the issues with all
available resources."
    The United States has accused Japan of reneging on an
agreement that called on it to stop selling cut-price computer
microchips in world markets and to try to import more American
semiconductors. Tokyo has denied the charges.
    The Foreign Ministry official refused to rule out Japanese
retaliation if America went ahead with its threatened tariffs
in the middle of this month. But he said that any response
would be in accordance with international law and Japan's
international obligations.
    He added that both Japan and the United States must take
account of the impact of their dispute on their own and the
world economy.

<TITLE>NEWS CORP &lt;NWS> STARTS HARPER/ROW &lt;HPR> BID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>News Corp Ltd of Australia said it has
started its previously announced tender offer for all shares of
Harper and Row Publishers Inc at 65 dlrs per share.
    In a newspaper advertisement, the company said the offer is
conditioned on received of at least 51 pct of Harper and Row's
shares.  The offering and withdrawal rights expire April 29
unless extended.
    A merger at the tender price is to follow the offer, which
has been approved by the Harper and Row board.  Harper and Row
has granted NEw Corp an option to buy up to 800,000 new shares
or a 15.4 pct interest at 65 dlrs each.
    News Corp said if the merger agreement were terminated
under certain circumstances, News would be entitled to a 16 mln
dlr cash payment.
    Last month, Theodore Cross offered to acquire Harper and
Row for 34 dlrs per share but was soon outbid by Harcourt Brace
Jovanovich Inc, which offered 50 dlrs per share.  Late in the
month, Harper and Row said its board had received expressions
of interest from a number of domestic and foreign companies.

<TITLE>INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY &lt;ITX> SEES 4TH QTR LOSS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORRANCE, Calif., April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>International Technology corp
said it expects to report a loss for the fourth quarter ended
March 31 of about 20 cts per share, compared with a
year-earlier profit of 11 cts.
    The company blamed the expected loss on regulatory and
permitting issues that limited the full utilization of
hazardous waste treatment cites in Califoirnia, continued
startup delays for major remediation projects, the writeoff of
an investment in a subsidiary and a settlem,ent with the
California Attorney General's Office and Department of Health
Services.
    The company said the settlement relates to regulatory
violations alleged by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agengy
and the California Health Services department at the company's
Vine Hill and Panoche treatment facilities in Northern
California.
    It said under the agreement, it will pay the state
2,100,000 dlrs in civil penalties over a two-year period and
pay 500,000 dlrs over five years to local medical facilities as
part of a community awareness and emergency response program
developed by local communities.  The expenses will be charged
against fourth quarter results, it said.
    The company said it has agreed as well to make compliance
and public safety capital expenditures of about 600,000 dlrs.
    It said it has now received an operating permit for a new
250,000 cubic yard landfill cell at its Imperial County,
Calif., from the Health Services department.
    The company said the Panoche facility remains closed but is
expected to reopen for liquid and sludge receipts in the near
future.  But it said receipts of solid material, which had
accounted for the majority of the revenue at the site, could be
restricted until 1988 pending resolution of capacity issues in
the Panoche site permit.

<TITLE>WESTLB LUXEMBOURG REPORTS LOWER 1986 NET PROFIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DUESSELDORF, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale
&lt;WELG.F> said its wholly-owned Luxembourg subsidiary WestLB
International SA posted a decline in 1986 net profit to 12.6
mln marks from 48.5 mln a year earlier.
    WestLB International will pay a 12.5 mln mark dividend to
WestLB, down from 47.7 mln a year earlier.
    The dividend was lower than in 1985 because the record
profit of the previous year could not be repeated, due to
changed market conditions, it said. Increased funds were also
allocated for provisions. Business in the first three months of
1987 developed positively, it added.
    WestLB International set aside 115.3 mln marks for
international credit risks in 1986, up from 97.4 mln marks in
1985, bringing the total amount of provisions shown in the
balance sheet to 580.3 mln marks.
    Operating profit fell to 122 mln marks in 1986 from 150 mln
in 1985. Balance sheet total fell to 9.7 billion marks from
10.8 billion, reflecting the lower dollar and the fact that
credit business redemptions were not fully offset by new
lending.
    The statement said WestLB International's business with
private customers showed a pleasing expansion last year.
    This development was aided by cooperation between the bank
and the savings banks in the West German state of North
Rhine-Westphalia, where parent bank WestLB is based.
    Deposits by non-banks rose more than 40 pct to a total of
1.1 billion.
    WestLB International said it plans to expand its range of
services for private clients.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Coffee producers belonging to the "Other
Milds" group will meet May 4 in Guatemala to discuss the
possibility of restoring export quotas, producer delegates told
reporters after the closing session of the International Coffee
Organization, ICO, executive board meeting.
    The "Other Milds" group, comprising Costa Rica, Dominican
Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, India,
Mexico, Nicaragua, Papua New Guinea and Peru, might consult
with Brazil and Colombia on this meeting, but it was not
certain whether these two countries would attend, they said.
    The ICO board meeting ended without moves to restart
negotiations on quotas, which broke down last month, producer
delegates said.
    Producers are expected to hold other consultations in the
coming months on how to proceed with quota negotiations, but no
date for a full producer meeting has been mentioned, they said.
    The board completed reports on stock verification and the
next regular board session will be in Indonesia June 1-5,
delegates said.

textiles and other goods connected with the textile industry as
part of its economic liberalisation programme, Finance Minister
Vishnu Lutchmeenaraido said.
    Lutchmeenaraido said the move was aimed at boosting the
local textiles industry and making this Indian Ocean island a
shopping paradise for textile goods. He said all types of
textiles, textile machinery and associated goods such as sewing
thread, buttons and collar supports would be placed on the
duty-free list, effective from April 1.
    Official sources said the government was also planning to
abolish import duties on fertiliser and agricultural equipment,
with the liberalisation measures would be extended to other
areas of industry later.
    The textiles industry dominates Mauritius's Export
Processing Zone, and the island has become a major exporter of
woollen knitwear.

<TITLE>MELLON &lt;MEL> SEES LARGE FIRST-QUARTER LOSS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PITTSBURGH, PA., April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Mellon Bank Corp said it expects
to report a loss for the first quarter in the range of 55 mln
to 65 mln dlrs or 2.13 to 2.15 dlrs a share.
    The company also said it intends to reduce its second
quarter common stock dividend to 35 cts a share from 69 cts.
    Mellon said it will make a provision for loan losses in the
first quarter of 175 mln dlrs, reflecting about 95 mln dlrs in
charge-offs and 80 mln dlrs in additions to the loan-loss
reserve.
    It will also put 310 mln dlrs in Brazilian loans on a cash
basis, resulting in interest reversals of 10 mln dlrs.
    In the first quarter of 1986, Mellon earned 60.4 mln dlrs
or 2.13 dlrs a share.
    Chairman David Barnes said the loan charge-offs and
increased provisions address four areas of concern in the
bank's wholesale lending portfolio - the energy sector,
developing countries, some basic industrial companies and
several commercial real estate businesses.
    Mellon said the loan loss reserve at the end of the first
quarter is estimated to be 575 mln dlrs, or about 2.5 pct of
the loan book, compared with 493.8 mln dlrs or 2.17 pct of
total loans at the end of 1986.
    Mellon said its primary capital ratio at the end of the
first quarter will be in line with the end-1986 figure of 7.23
pct, well in excess of regulatory guidelines.
    Non-performing loans at quarter-end are estimated at 1.45
billion dlrs, or 6.5 pct of the loan portfolio, compared with
928 mln dlrs or 3.94 pct at the end of 1986.
    Barnes noted that Mellon has a bigger involvement in
energy-based lending than many other banks. Because of the lack
of a substantial recovery in energy prices this year,
especially in natural gas prices, it was felt prudent to
increase reserves and take losses on loans in this sector.
    "This action relates both to loans to companies directly
involved in energy, as well as loans to real estate developers,
home builders and financial institutions in the Southwestern
United States," Barnes said.
    As for LDC loans, he said Mellon had removed about 80 mln
dlrs in fully current Argentine loans from cash basis but had
charged off about 20 mln dlrs in private-sector Mexican debt.
    He said Mellon, which was ordered in December to quit
Brazil because of its refusal to renew some short-term credit
lines, expects to participate in efforts to helpt Brazil and
other sovereign borrowers to reschedule their debts.
    Loans to basic industries were not major contributors to
the increase in non-performing assets or to first-quarter
charge offs, but Mellon said it remains concerned about the
absence of a strong recovery in steel and related industries.
    The increase in reserves, the dividend cut and continued
management cost-cutting are aimed at ensuring that Mellon has
the financial strength to deal with current uncertainties,
Barnes said.
    "We cannot predict when the uncertainties that presently
trouble us will end, but we are confident we are managing them
aggressively," he added.

&lt;KLKG.F> should have turnover this year around 1985/86's 2.4
billion marks though more growth is likely in engineering in
coming years, management board chairman Herbert Gienow said.
    He told a news conference at the trade fair here that by
the mid-1990s turnover should reach between six and seven
billion marks, mainly through acquisitions totalling "several
hundred million marks."
    Kloeckner reported in March higher profits in its
engineering sector which enabled it to raise profits by nearly
a third in the 1985/86 year to 45.2 mln marks from 33.8 mln.

California Public Utilities Commission decision to reconsider

<TITLE>ELI LILLY &lt;LLY> TO SELL ELIZABETH ARDEN UNIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    INDIANAPOLIS, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Eli Lilly and Co said its board
decided to sell Elizabeth Arden Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary
that manufactures and markets cosmetics and fine fragrance
products.
    It said the business, which had sales of 67 mln dlrs when
it was acquired in 1971, had sales last year of 398 mln dlrs,
up 12 pct from 1985. It had operating profits of about 33 mln
dlrs in 1986.
    Lilly said it retained Morgan Stanley and Co to help
evaluate offers.
    Lilly said it expects to use the after-tax proceeds from
the sale of its cosmetics business for general corporate
purposes, including the repurchase from time to time of its
common stock or warrants on the open market.
    In a statement, Lilly Chairman Richard Wood said "This
strategic decision was reached on the basis of our belief that
in the future the corporation's resources, including its
research activities, should be focused on its other business
which have a high technology, life sciences orientation."

<DATELINE>    MADRID, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>An estimated 1.2 mln metro users in
Madrid were stranded today as striking railway workers halted
the underground transport system, industry sources said. The
strikers joined coal miners, steel and oil refinery workers in
Spain's latest wave of stoppages over wage demands.
    Some 10,000 pitmen in the northern province of Leon entered
the second day of an indefinite stoppage to demand wage rises
and a five-day working week, the sources said.
    Oil refinery workers picketed the state-owned Empresa
Nacional de Petroleo SA (EMP) to prevent fuel lorries leaving
the company's largest plant in Puertollano, central Spain.
    Paramilitary police were guarding steel mills at Reinosa,
in northern Spain, from the daily protests against planned job
cuts. A local government official said the police force would
remain in place until tempers had cooled down.
    More than 60 people were injured in pitched battles between
police and steel foundry workers in Reinosa last month.

agreements to restructure about 125 mln dlrs in debt that call

    The restructured agreements call for suspending dividend
payment on Tidewater's common and convertible adjustable

including a requirement to maintain minimum tangible net worth.
    &lt;Prudential Insurance Co> and Manufacturers Hanover Corp
&lt;MHC>, the company's principle lenders, will receive as
collateral a pledge of stock in Tidewater subsidiaries that own

<TITLE>ELI LILLY &lt;LLY> TO BUY 2.3 MLN SHARES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    INDIANAPOLIS, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Eli Lilly and Co said its board
approved a plan to buy up to 2.3 mln shares of its common stock
to offset dilution from conversion of its 10-year notes issued
in connection with the acquisition of Hybritech Inc in March
1986.
    The non-transferable notes pay interest at an annual rate
of 6.75 pct. The notes, which mature on March 31, 1996, became
convertible into 2.3 mln shares of Lilly stock at 66.31 dlrs a
share beginning March 18, 1987.
    Lilly said it will buy shares of stock from time to time in
the open market at prevailing prices or in privately negotiated
transactions.
    The newly announced purchase plan is in addition to its
existing anti-dilutive stock repurchase programs. Under these
programs, the company systematically buys back shares in the
open market to replace shares issued under its stock plan and
acquisition earnout agreements.
    Currently the only other potentially diluting instruments
are the warrants that the company also issued in connection
with the Hybritech acquisition.
    Lilly issued 17.1 mln warrants with an expiration of March
31, 1991. A warrant gives the holder the right to purchase one
share of Lilly common at 75.98 dlrs. Since the acquisition,
Lilly has repurchased 2.0 mln warrants, so there are currently
15.1 mln outstanding.
    The warrants are publicly traded on the New York Stock
Exchange.
    Because of the theoretical size of the dilution resulting
from the outstanding warrants, warrants convertible notes,
stock plan and acquisition earnout agreements, the company said
it will be required to report earnings per share on a fully
diluted basis beginnng with the first quarter of 1987.
    At the end of February, Lilly had 139.6 mln shares
outstanding.

<TITLE>GPU &lt;GPU> DECLARES FIRST DIVIDEND SINCE 1979</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARSIPANNY, N.J., April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>General Public Utilities Corp
said its board declared a dividend of 15 cts per share on
common stock, its first dividend since it omitted payment in
February 1980 as a result of the Three Mile Island nuclear
accident in 1979.
    The company said it was able to declare the dividend due to
progress in the cleanup of Three Mile Island Unit Two.
    A company spokesman said GPU expects to continue declaring
dividends on a quarterly basis, with the rate depending on the
progress of the cleanup and on other company operations.
    GPU said the dividend is of "modest size," representing
less than a third of the amount paid as a dividend by the
average electric utility.
    "As the operating companies need to return to the capital
markets for debt and preferred stock, this should tend to
produce lower cost and better terms," the company said.
    The dividend is payable May 29 to holders of record April
24.

    The EC's executive commission said in a statement spending

    Another 60 mln ECUs could be added if EC ministers switch

    Italy is the largest net beneficiary in 1987, getting 635
mln ECUs, with Britain in second place with 580 mln.

<TITLE>YEUTTER STRESSES IMPORTANCE OF TRADE TALKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter stressed the importance of trade negotiations to open
foreign markets rather than trade restrictions in a statement
to the Senate Finance Committee.
    "In the long term we cannot repeatedly bludgeon other
nations into opening their markets with threats of U.S.
restrictions. Rather, we must be able to negotiate credibly for
global liberalization," Yeutter said.
    Yeutter did not mention the recent U.S. trade sanctions
against Japanese semiconductors in his testimony on the pending
trade bill.
    Yeutter said the trade bill should increase U.S.
competitiveness, aid U.S. trade negotiating leverage, and avoid
provoking foreign retaliation.
    He urged Congress to reject provisions that would mandate
U.S. retaliation against foreign unfair trade practices.
    Yeutter emphasized the importance of the new multilateral
trade negotiating round and called on Congress to quickly
approve an extension of U.S. negotiating authority.
    "We want to open foreign markets and establish and enforce
rules of international competition, not foster dependence on
protection and subsidies," he said.

enter into a new trade dispute unless urgent action is taken to
explain EC farm policy to the U.S. Congress, French official
sources said.
    They said Prime Minister Jacques Chirac planned to urge EC
Commission president Jacques Delors to send a team of experts
to Washington as soon as possible.
    Chirac returned to Paris this morning after three days of
talks in New York and Washington in which trade and
protectionism featured prominently.
    At the centre of the new trade tension is an EC Commission
proposal to tax vegetable oils, the sources said.

    Shell previously reported 1986 operating profit fell to 130

    The company also said 1987 capital and exploration spending

<TITLE>BANK OF SPAIN GOVERNOR SAYS MONEY GROWTH TOO FAST</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MADRID, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bank of Spain governor Mariano Rubio said
the central bank was worried that money supply was growing too
fast, reflecting excessive internal demand in the Spanish
economy, but added that he was confident recent measures would
succeed in restricting money growth.
    In testimony to the economic commission of Congress, Rubio
said the main measure of money supply, the broad-based Liquid
Assets in Public Hands, grew at an estimated annualised rate of
17 pct in March, the same as in February.
    The bank's target range for growth in this measure in 1987
is 6.5 to 9.5 pct, compared with 11.4 pct last year.
    Rubio said he was aiming for the lower end of the range.
    He added that real GDP growth of three pct in 1986 was due
to a six pct increase in real internal demand and a three pct
real drop in the contribution of the external sector.
    The aim for 1987 was for the same real growth in GDP but a
drop in the internal contribution to 4.5 pct with the negative
component of the external sector trimmed to 1.5 pct, he said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>No changes have been made or are
being planned in the Agriculture Department's calculation of
price differentials between interior grain locations and the
Texas Gulf, a senior USDA official said.
    Ralph Klopfenstein, USDA deputy administrator for commodity
operations, told Reuters, "We do not anticipate any changes to
be made" in the Texas Gulf differentials used to calculate
posted county prices for corn.
    "We do not relate the Texas Gulf structure with the
Louisiana Gulf structure at all. It's a totally different
situation," he said.
    Rumors had circulated through the market this morning that
USDA had widened Texas Gulf differentials in a similar manner
to last weekend's adjustments with the Louisiana Gulf.

<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Australia and New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd in New Zealand said it will raise its indicator
lending rate to 23 pct from 21.5 pct on April 7.
    A bank statement said the continuing rise in the cost of
funds had to be passed on to the lending customers.
    ANZ managing director Brian Weeks said: "Recent developments
in the money markets are of deep concern to all participants
... Market participants are understandably nervous and cautious
about future developments.
    These include flows to and from the government relating to
the privatisation of seven government departments on April 1.
    "We welcome the flexibility evident in the Reserve Bank's
move to raise the system cash target yesterday, but feel that
to reduce the present nervousness the cash target and primary
liquidity level need to be raised further...," he said.
    The Reserve Bank has raised its daily cash target to 45 mln
N.Z. Dlrs from its normal 30 mln dlrs.
    Call rates have traded as high as 65 pct this week because
of business year-end March 31 balance date book squaring.
    Westpac Banking Corp in New Zealand announced yesterday it
would increase its indicator lending rate by 1.5 percentage
points to 22.5 pct on April 7.

<TITLE>GERMAN MARCH UNADJUSTED JOBLESS FALLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NUREMBERG, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German unemployment, unadjusted
for seasonal factors, fell to 2.41 mln in March from 2.49 mln
in February, the Federal Labour Office said.
    The total represents 9.6 pct of the workforce compared with
10.0 pct in February.
    The seasonally adjusted jobless total rose, however, in
March to 2.23 mln from 2.18 mln in February, it added.
    In March last year the unadjusted unemployment total stood
at 2.45 mln and represented 9.8 pct of the workforce.
Seasonally adjusted unemployment was 2.29 mln.
    The Federal Labour Office said the number of workers on
short time rose by 80,629 to 462,802 and the number of
vacancies increased by 15,263 to 180,047.
    Labour Office President Heinrich Franke, announcing the
figures, said the hesitant decline in the unadjusted jobless
total reflected continuing bad weather, slack activity in the
capital goods sector and structural changes in the coal and
steel industry.
    In a separate statement, the Federal Statistics Office said
the rise in the overall number of people in employment had
slowed in February.
    The Office said that, according to estimates for February,
25.7 mln people were in work, a rise of around 240,000 or 0.9
pct compared with the same month in 1986.
    It noted that in January the year-on-year rise was 250,000
or 1.0 pct and the number in work stood at 25.78 mln. The
decline in February compared with January reflected seasonal
factors, it added.

    The new CDs, with maturities of six months, one year and
two years, carry interest rates ranging from 4.07 pct to 5.12
pct, he said.
    The issues are intended to help curb the growth of the M-1b
money supply which has grown as a result of increasing foreign
exchange reserves.
    The reserves hit a record 53 billion U.S. Dlrs last month.

<TITLE>PAKISTANI DECISION WILL HURT KENYAN TEA EXPORTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NAIROBI, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pakistan's decision to suspend tea
import licences will hurt Kenyan tea exports in the short term
while exporters seek new markets, sources close to Nairobi
broking houses and exporters said.
    Broking house officials in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo
yesterday told Reuters Pakistan had suspended the licences in
order to link tea imports to Pakistani exports.
    The latest available figures show that Kenyan exports to
Pakistan, mainly tea, were worth 75 mln dlrs in 1985, while
imports from Pakistan amounted to only 4.8 mln dlrs. Kenya
provides over 50 pct of Pakistan's tea imports.
    The Nairobi sources said the Pakistani decision did not
come as a surprise as Pakistan had been complaining of the
trade imbalance for some time.
    "We are very disappointed that Pakistan took such action ...
(it) will certainly hurt Kenya's tea industry in the short term
as Pakistan is Kenya's second largest market," a source at one
broking house told Reuters.
    One tea broker said Pakistan's move had already affected
Kenya's tea trade and was largely responsible for an average
fall of two shillings a kilo at the export auction in Mombasa
last Monday.
    "The trend is likely to continue until other countries
replace Pakistan, which usually buys all qualities of our tea,"
he added.
    Kenya has for a long time relied on Britain, Pakistan,
Egypt and, to a lesser extent the United States, as major
markets for its tea, the sources added.
    Small-scale exporters who export mainly to Pakistan would
be worst hit by the Pakistani move as it would take them longer
to find new outlets, they said.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cocoa futures fell to session lows by
midmorning, posting losses from last night of six to two stg a
tonne in 1987 deliveries, dealers said.
    Weekend profittaking by jobbers and general book-squaring
featured the fall which was aided by steady sterling versus the
dollar and lack of offtake in the physicals market.
    Dealers said the market was switch and straddle-bound, in
that any pressure on one particular month was certain to be
reflected in adjacent deliveries.
    The undertone, however, remained cautious as operators
await an eventual start to ICCO buffer stock buying, dealers
said.
    The market was originally forecast to open with average
five stg gains from last night following New York's firmer
close yesterday, dealers said.
    But this was largely counter-balanced by currency factors.
    Near July traded at its session low of 1,327 stg after one
hour versus 1,333 bid last night and an early high of 1,335.
    Volume midmorning was 730 lots including 350 lots crossed
and 108 switches.
    There was no sign of any origin activity.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bass Plc &lt;BASS.L> and &lt;Horizon Travel

mln stg for Horizon by Bass.
    The offer values each Horizon share at some 0.213 of a Bass
ordinary share, or 190p. This is based on a price of 892p, the
Bass share quotation at 1630 gmt on April 2.
    Horizon said its board and financial advisers consider the
offer to be fair and reasonable and the board will unanimously
recommend acceptance to its shareholders.
    Horizon shares jumped 23p to 188 after the announcement
while Bass shares dipped 13p to 879.
    Bass has for some time regarded overseas holidays as an
area for expansion and in pursuit of this objective, acquired a
25.6 pct holding in Horizon in 1985 when it set up the jointly
owned hotel company.
    Both Bass and Horizon said that Bass's resources will
enable Horizon's businesses to expand strongly this year.
    On March 30 Bass said it had agreed to sell its Pontins
U.K. Holiday camps to a newly formed private company, Pontins
Ltd, for some 57.5 mln stg.

<TITLE>ROTTERDAM'S MAIN GRAIN TERMINAL CLOSED BY STRIKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROTTERDAM, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Grain handling at Rotterdam port's
main grain terminal was at a standstill today as members of the
largest Dutch transport union FNV staged a lightning strike for
the third day running.
    Pieter van der Vorm, managing director of Graan Elevator
Mij (GEM), which handles 95 pct of grain passing through the
port, said their main Europoort terminal was out of action
because of a strike by technical staff.
    The actions, in support of union demands in negotiations
over a new labour agreement, began on Wednesday when grain
handlers stopped work.
    Van der Vorm said that if strikes continued on today's
scale for some time vessels coming to unload grain in Rotterdam
would face delays, but this was not happening yet.
    Wednesday's actions left GEM's facilities 40 pct
operational, and there were only limited strikes yesterday.
    Talks between unions and employers yesterday and today
produced no result, but FNV spokesman Bert Duim said the union
was prepared to put their key demand, for a 36 hour working
week, at the bottom of the agenda.
    Van der Vorm said, however, the union's demands on a range
of issues were far in excess of the management's final offer.

<TITLE>SOUTH KOREA TO PAY MORE FOR JAPANESE ETHYLENE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Korea will pay about 20 pct more for
ethylene imported from Japan in the second quarter of the year
because increased plastic production in both countries has
boosted demand and tightened supplies, chemical industry
sources said.
    South Korea has agreed to pay Japanese trading houses just
over 400 dlrs C and F per tonne, up from an average of 350 dlrs
in the first quarter and throughout 1986, they said.
    South Korean demand for imported ethylene this month has
risen to 17,000 tonnes from 10,000 last month, and the country
may face difficulties covering the extra volume, they said.
    &lt;Korea Petrochemical Industries Corp>, a producer of high
density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene, will more than
double its ethylene requirements to 9,000 tonnes a month from
4,000 when it completes a plant expansion at the end of this
month, the sources said.
    &lt;Honan Ethylene Corp's> import requirements have risen to
8,000 tonnes a month from 6,000 tonnes last year to meet strong
demand from &lt;Honan Petrochemical Co>, which makes HDPE and
ethylene glycol, and &lt;Hangyang Chemical>, which produces
low-density polyethylene and vinyl chloride monomer, they said.
    But Japan's ethylene plants are already operating at almost
full capacity of 4.5 mln tonnes a year just to fulfill domestic
demand, the sources said.
    "And even if Japan had the additional ethylene, there is a
logistical problem of finding extra appropriate-sized vessels
to ship it to Korea," said one trading house source.
    Japanese trading companies are looking to alternative
sources to supply South Korea's needs, including Saudi Arabia,
Qatar and Mexico, they said.
    But long-haul voyages are expensive as the product has to
be shipped at a temperature of minus 103 degrees centigrade to
keep it in a liquid form, they said.
    Japan has no plans to invest further in the ethylene
industry in order to cope with the additional demand, despite
rising prices, trading house sources said.
    South Korea has two projects in hand which will increase
its ethylene production capacity by 500,000 tonnes a year by
the end of 1989, so the strong demand surge for imports is only
a medium-term trend, they said.

compared with 1.3 pct in 1987. Low import prices in 1986 helped
to keep annual inflation down to 0.8 pct.
    The centre said that in general the outlook for the Swiss
economy in 1987 and 1988 remained favourable, despite the more
difficult international economic climate facing export
industry.
    The centre repeated its previous forecast that growth in
Swiss domestic product would slow to 2.2 pct in 1987 from 2.5
pct in 1986. It revised its forecast for 1988 GDP growth to 1.7
pct from 1.6 pct in its last autumn review.
    Domestic demand will continue to replace exports as the
motor of economic growth. Private consumption will grow by
three pct in 1987 and two pct in 1988 against 3.75 pct in 1986.
    Growth in goods exports will slow to 1.75 pct in 1987 from
2.1 pct in 1986 but pick up slightly to 2.5 pct in 1988. All
three figures are well below the Swiss average for recent
years. In 1985, for example, exports increased by 9.1 pct.
    The centre said the strength of the Swiss franc, which has
firmed sharply in recent months, would continue to put pressure
on Swiss exporters.
    It forecast that imports of goods would grow by a more
modest 4.5 pct in 1987 and 3.25 pct in 1988 than in 1986, when
import prices fell substantially and imports rose by 8.2 pct.
    Industrial production will grow by 1.6 pct in 1987 and 1.2
pct in 1988 compared with 4.2 pct in 1986.

<TITLE>LONDON SUGAR TRADES AT SESSION HIGHS BY MIDMORNING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Raw sugar futures firmed to session highs
by midmorning, securing gains from last night's basically
steady close of 1.00 to 1.80 dlrs a tonne in a 166 lot volume.
    Shortcovering against an oversold situation continued to
play a part in the extended rally with unsettled dollar rates
versus sterling providing additional support.
    Recent and prospective whites buying in the world market
was supportive but the raws section lacked feature, dealers
said.
    India and Egypt bought white sugar this week while next
week sees tenders by Pakistan, Greece and Syria, they said.
    May was at 154 dlrs from 152.80 asked last night.
    All London Daily prices rose two dlrs a tonne on tone.
    The Raws price was set at 150 dlrs Fob and 173 dlrs (107.50
stg) Cif.
    The Whites price was at 192 dlrs from 190 yesterday.

<TITLE>BELGIUM CUTS TREASURY CERTIFICATE RATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Belgian National Bank cut interest
rates on one, two and three-month treasury certificates to 7.30
pct from 7.40 pct effective immediately, the bank said in a
telex message.
    The Bank last adjusted its short-term treasury certificate
rates on March 23, when it also reduced rates for all three
periods by 0.10 points.
    A National Bank spokesman said the latest adjustment would
bring the rates closer in line with currently prevailing
interbank interest rates.
    The spokesman said it was too early to predict whether the
move would herald a reduction in discount rate, which currently
stands at eight pct, when the Bank holds its regular weekly
meeting at which the rate is discussed next Wednesday.
    The discount rate generally moves in tandem with the
three-month treasury certificate rate. However, there is no
formal link and the discount rate was not adjusted following
the March 23 changes.

<TITLE>CLOSURE OF BP SWEDEN REFINERY FORECAST</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>A Swedish Finance Ministry committee
forecast that British Petroleum Plc &lt;BP.L> may have to close
its refinery in Gothenburg because of an anticipated worsening
of the Swedish petroleum industry's competitiveness.
    It said in a report that the future of the Swedish refining
business was bleak due to the steady drop in domestic oil
consumption since the mid-1970s, a possible tightening of rules
on sulphur content and competition from Norway's Mongstad
facility of &lt;Den Norske Stats Olieselskab> (Statoil) &lt;STAT.OL>
when its expansion is completed in the 1990s.
    The committee said the BP refinery, which lacks a
de-sulphurisation plant, was likely to be closed or sold unless
costly investments were made to enhance the facility's capacity
to refine a broader range of products.
    But the committee noted that capacity utilisation had in
recent years been above that of the European refining industry
on average. The BP plant, in which Sweden's state-owned &lt;OK
Petroleum AB> has a 22 pct, started up in 1967 and has an
annual capacity of 4.7 mln tonnes.
    There was nobody at British Petroleum immediately available
for comment.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>RECENT SUGAR FALL SPARKS SOVIET, CHINESE BUYING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The recent fall in world sugar prices,
due to increased producer pricing sales and evidence of export
availability, has encouraged renewed buying interest from China
and the Soviet Union, London trade house E.D.And F. Man said.
    Further purchases are expected by the Peoples Republic of
China at the lower end of the recent price range, which should
limit the downside movement, it said in its latest monthly
market report.
   "And it is believed that the Soviet Union will need to return
to the market to take a further 250,000/350,000 tonnes for
May/June shipment, Man added.
    The Soviets purchased five cargoes of raws for April/May
shipment towards the end of last month, which brings its total
purchases to around 1.65 mln tonnes, Man said.
    Production estimates for the Thai crop now exceed 2.3 mln
tonnes and the final outturn appears set to reach around 2.5
mln tonnes. However, this upturn in the Thai crop is being
countered by a reduction in China's production forecast to 5.3
mln tonnes from 5.5 mln estimated earlier.
    Market participation by Cuba suggests that its crop could
be close to last year's 7.3 mln tonnes. But even with similar
production Man expects Cuban exports to be significantly down.
    Cuba was reported to be carrying 1.3 mln tonnes of stocks
in September 1985, of which some 440,000 tonnes were used to
boost its 1985/86 exports to about 6.9 mln. But as it will not
be able to draw on surplus stocks this year, Man estimates
Cuba's export availabilty will be reduced to 6.4 to 6.5 mln
tonnes.
    However, Cuba is only one of a large number of exporters
with reduced availability, Man said.
    Since 1980 the total free market export supply has fallen
to 18 mln from about 22 mln tonnes. But at the same time free
market demand has also fallen by almost the same amount, which
has left exporters chasing falling import requirements.
    A fairly tight balance now appears to have emerged. But the
difficult task of keeping production advances at bay still
remains, as at least one more season of production deficit is
needed to eliminate some of the remaining surplus stocks still
overhanging the market, Man said.
    The increasing cases of record production as a result of
record yields and better husbandry have forced sugar producers
to strive for greater efficiency.
    As this increase in efficiency reduces the marginal cost of
production, sugar exporters may become more responsive to
prices and in particular to upward price movements, Man said.
    Commenting on the current row between the EC Commission and
sugar producers, Man said despite the recent improvement in the
level of restitutions, they are still insufficient to fully
compensate producers when exporting on the world market.
    Unless there are further improvements, at least some sugar
is expected to remain in intervention, it added.

<TITLE>NO INTERVENTION, DOLLAR FIXED AT 1.8162 MARKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bundesbank did not intervene as
the dollar was fixed lower at 1.8162 marks after 1.8270
yesterday, dealers said.
    The dollar firmed slightly from its opening 1.8135/45 marks
in very quiet pre-weekend trading and dealers said they
expected business to remain thin this afternoon.
    "Trading is at an absolute nil, nobody wants to get involved
ahead of next week's meetings," one dealer with a U.S. Bank
said, referring to the Group of Seven industrial nations and
the International Monetary Fund meetings in Washington.
    Dealers saw the dollar staying at current levels but
possibly rising above 1.83 marks on any supporting remarks
emerging from the meetings. "But the dollar's medium-term
direction is soft," one dealer said.
    The dollar could well come under renewed pressure after the
international forums as attention returned to the U.S. And the
U.K.'s trade dispute with Japan, dealers said.
    Cross currency trading was also subdued though sterling's
rise above 1.60 dlrs helped it to firm against the mark. It was
fixed higher at 2.924 marks after yesterday's 2.910.
    The pound was seen staying between 2.90 and 2.93 marks for
the next days, dealers said.
    Eurodollar deposit rates were steady from this morning,
with six month funds unchanged at midpoint 6-11/16 pct. Six
month euromarks stayed at midpoint 3-7/8 pct.
    The Swiss franc firmed to 119.86 marks per 100 at the fix
from 119.71 yesterday and the yen rose to 1.244 marks per 100
from 1.243.
    The French franc was little changed at 30.050 marks per 100
after 30.055 yesterday.

<TITLE>KEPPEL RAISES BOND ISSUE TO 75 MLN DLRS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SINGAPORE, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Keppel Corp Ltd &lt;KPLM.SI> said it has
decided to increase its convertible bond issue to 75 mln U.S.
Dlrs from 60 mln following overwhelming response since its
launch on March 24.
    "This clearly reflects the confidence investors have in the
Keppel group. The bond will improve the group's debt structure
significantly," Keppel chairman Sim Kee Boon said.
    When the bonds are converted, Keppel's debt and interest
expense will be further reduced and place the group in a much
better financial position to expand and diversify its
activities, Sim said.
    The 10-year bonds, issued at par, will carry a four pct
annual interest and will be convertible at 3.12 Singapore dlrs
per one-dlr share in Keppel.
    The issue is lead-managed by &lt;Morgan Grenfell and Co Ltd>
with &lt;Daiwa Singapore Co Ltd> and &lt;Morgan Grenfell (Asia) Ltd>,
and is syndicated among leading domestic and international
banks and securities houses.
    Last month, Keppel reported a group net profit of 5.1 mln
Singapore dlrs for the year ended December 31, 1986 against a
loss of 129.6 mln dlrs in 1985.

<TITLE>PHILIPPINES SAYS DEBT PACT "BETTER THAN MEXICO'S'</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Central bank governor Jose Fernandez said
the 10.3 billion dlr debt restructuring package he and Finance
Secretary Jaime Ongpin negotiated with the Philippines'
commercial creditors was better than Mexico's.
    "I think we got a better deal. It was really an enormous
drop, a reduction in rates and that to me is the critical
element," he told Reuters.
    He was reacting to comments by local economists who said
Manila's debt accord was no better than Mexico's, which had won
a 20-year repayment, including a seven-year grace last year at
13/16 points over London interbank offered rates (Libor).
    The Philippines clinched a repayment of 17 years, including
a grace period of 7-1/2 years on 10.3 billion dlrs of its total
debt of 27.8 billion.
    But Fernandez said what was more significant was that
Manila came down from 1-7/8 on the new money and 1-5/8 on the
restructured debt to 7/8 points. Mexico, on the other hand
dropped to 13/16 from 14/16.
    "They got a 1/16 reduction. We got almost a one percentage
point reduction," he said.
    Asked why some features of the debt agreement such as the
token prepayments of principal were not made public
immediately, he said "These are very long documents and in a
press statement you can only cover the key points. But these
will be made available to you."
    Ongpin confirmed on Tuesday that a Reuter report from New
York that Manila will pay its commercial creditors 111 mln dlrs
over 1987-1989 was accurate.
    He omitted the token prepayments in previous announcements
but said there was nothing secret about them.

<TITLE>SPAIN REVISES ECONOMIC TARGETS FOR 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MADRID, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Spain has revised some of its main
economic targets for 1987 after studying the performance of the
economy in the first quarter, the economy ministry said in its
monthly bulletin.
    Internal demand is now forecast to rise four pct against a
previous target of 3.5 pct.
    Mariano Rubio, governor of the Bank of Spain, the central
bank, yesterday said internal demand was currently growing at
an annual rate of six pct and it had to be brought down to four
pct if the government were to meet its five pct inflation
target this year. Inflation was 8.3 pct in 1986.
    The forecast for private consumption growth remains
unchanged at three pct, although public consumption is revised
upwards to 2.5 pct from 2.0 pct.
    Growth in domestic demand will fuel imports, expected to
increase by 8.6 pct against an originally estimated 7.1 pct.
    Export growth has been revised downwards to 3.7 pct from
5.2 pct due to the peseta's continuing strength against the
dollar and slack external demand.
    Slow growth of exports and a tight rein on state spending
has lowered estimated GDP growth to three pct in 1987 from an
earlier forecast 3.5 pct. GDP grew by three pct last year.
    The economy ministry is holding its inflation forecast to
five pct, in spite of minister Carlos Solchaga's doubts last
week on whether this target could be maintained if wage
settlements continue to rise above the government's recommended
five pct ceiling.
    Unions and employers dispute the average wage increases
agreed so far this year. Trade unions calculate wage
settlements have produced average rises of 7.3 pct against 5.5
pct estimated by the employers' federation CEOE.

<TITLE>BEGHIN-SAY NOT PLANNING TO WITHDRAW SUGAR</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Audrey Stuart, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>French sugar producer Beghin-Say is not
currently planning to withdraw the sugar it has placed into
intervention, despite the exceptionally high rebate awarded at
this week's European Community (EC) sugar tender, Beghin-Say
President Jean-Marc Vernes told Reuters.
    The maximum rebate of 46.864 Ecus per 100 kilos on
Wednesday was the largest ever granted, according to traders.
    Vernes said he was satisfied the European Commission has
started to move in the right direction, but said his company
had no plans to change its decision to put sugar into
intervention.
    But Vernes said he hoped that in the next few weeks a final
agreement would be reached with the commission which would
allow operators to withdraw the sugar from intervention.
    European operators offered 854,000 tonnes of sugar into
intervention to protest about export rebates which they say are
too low. Over 785,000 tonnes of this sugar was accepted by the
commission on Wednesday, according to commission sources.
    Under EC regulations, however, operators have another four
to five weeks to withdraw the sugar from intervention before
payment is made for it.
    A total of 706,470 tonnes of French sugar and 79,000 tonnes
of West German sugar has been accepted into intervention, trade
sources said here. This amount represents about a third of
annual EC exports to non-EC countries.
    Beghin-Say declined to specify the amount of sugar it had
offered into intervention, but said it was below 500,000
tonnes.
    Producers say they have been losing 2.5 to 3.0 Ecus on
every 100 kilos exported due to the failure of rebates to fully
bridge the gap between EC and world prices. Wednesday's rebate
was 0.87 Ecus short of what producers say is needed to get an
equivalent price to that for sales into intervention, traders
said.
    Vernes said operators hope to get a rebate which equates to
the full intervention price and said Wednesday's tender was a
step in the right direction.
    Sugar producers here said the volume of sugar authorised
for export since the begining of the current campaign had been
inadequate and that more should be exported now to compensate.
    Trade sources said new regulations governing export
rebates, which are due to be adopted shortly, may smooth the
path for the commission to award larger export rebates in
future.
    One source at a leading French sugar house said it seemed
the commission had understood the protest action and was now
moving towards adapting the situation accordingly, thereby
allowing the operators to withdraw their sugar from
intervention once they got satisfaction.

<TITLE>STOLTENBERG SAYS PARIS ACCORD POLICY TO CONTINUE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg said the currency agreement reached in Paris in
February had been successful and would be continued.
    Stoltenberg told journalists before he attends next week's
International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington that: "The ...
Strategy to stabilise currencies around current levels has
proven its worth and will also determine future developments."
    Stoltenberg declined to comment specifically on what he
would consider to be an undervalued dollar but said a dollar
around 1.80 marks created problems for West Germany's exports.
    Stoltenberg said studies by international organisations had
made it clear that especially in the U.S. And in Japan major
efforts remained necessary to support adjustments in foreign
trade balances via necessary corrections to economic policy.
    "No-one would benefit if, after years of over-valuation, the
U.S. Dollar fell into the other extreme, that is, strong
under-valuation," he said.
    Stoltenberg said West Germany had a keen interest in a
swift agreement between the U.S. And Japan concerning the
current trade dispute over semi-conductors.
    Asked whether he believed the markets would test the Paris
currency accord, Stoltenberg did not comment specifically but
noted that much of what had been discussed in Paris had not
been published.
    The Paris declaration did not state the levels at which
central banks of the major industrialised countries would
intervene.
    Stoltenberg said that everything had been carefully
considered. He said he had nothing further to add.
    Stoltenberg also appeared to suggest that West Germany was
now no longer under any pressure from the U.S. Government to
stimulate its economy.
    He declined to respond specifically to a question on this
subject but said, "You must attach particular importance to the
consensus which was reached in Paris."
    The minister nevertheless added that he would make clear
during his trip to Washington that West Germany's nominal trade
figures gave a false impression about actual trade flows.
    Stoltenberg noted that in 1986 Bonn's exports fell by a
nominal two pct while its nominal imports fell by 10.7 pct.
West Germany's imports dropped largely because of foreign
currency developments and the cheaper price of oil and led to a
record trade surplus last year.
    However, Stoltenberg said that in real terms West Germany's
exports by volume had increased by 1.5 pct while real imports
had risen by a much stronger 6.2 pct.
    In this way West Germany had made its contribution to
economic stability, Stoltenberg added.
    Stoltenberg noted the government expected imports to rise
by a real four to five pct in 1987 with exports stagnating.
    He said it was too early to revise official forecasts for
West Germany's economic growth this year. The government has
forecast an unchanged 2.5 pct rise in Gross National Product.
    The Kiel Institute, a leading research body, is still
expecting growth of three pct but some other research
institutes have revised forecasts down to below two pct.
Stoltenberg said the wide range of predictions showed how many
imponderables had to be taken into account and said no drastic
changes in official forecasts were needed.

<TITLE>GERMAN CHEMICAL INDUSTRY SEES LOWER PROFITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HANOVER, West Germany, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>West Germany's chemical
industry fears mounting risks will hurt earnings but hopes 1987
turnover will stabilize around 1986's 140 billion marks, Josef
Strenger, a board member of the industry association VCI, said.
    Strenger, management board chairman of Bayer AG &lt;BAYG.F>,
told a news conference at the Hanover trade fair the main
dangers were stagnation in world trade, the lower dollar as
well as crude oil and commodity prices.
    Prospects of higher operating costs were also seen harming
earnings, he said. Turnover took a considerable downturn at the
start of 1987 after falling 5.9 pct in 1986.
    The chemical industry, which relies heavily on exports, was
badly hit by mark appreciation in 1986 and lower turnover was
mainly due to foreign exchange losses, Strenger said.
    Exports fell 6.4 pct to 72 billion marks in 1986 and
competition from U.S. And British firms increased. Savings from
lower oil and commodity prices were eaten up by price
competition and increased costs.
    Strenger said 1986 operating profits of German chemical
firms were slightly worse than the year before but the improved
financial and balance sheet structure, after three good years,
neutralized the negative impact.
    Strenger said the industry would try to increase production
in the U.S. To make up for lost export possibilities out of
West Germany.
    The lower dollar was the main reason for an 8.3 pct fall in
exports to North America, an 11.4 pct drop to Latin America and
22.6 pct plunge to the Middle East.
    Exports to Western Europe eased 3.5 pct and Far East
exports, due to an economic revival in Japan, dropped 5.2 pct.
    Strenger noted that the industry had lost public confidence
following several cases of chemical pollution of the Rhine late
last year.

<TITLE>PHILIPPINES SAYS DEBT PACT "BETTER THAN MEXICO'S'</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Central bank governor Jose Fernandez said
the 10.3 billion dlr debt restructuring package he and Finance
Secretary Jaime Ongpin negotiated with the Philippines'
commercial creditors was better than Mexico's.
    "I think we got a better deal. It was really an enormous
drop, a reduction in rates and that to me is the critical
element," he told Reuters.
    He was reacting to comments by local economists who said
Manila's debt accord was no better than Mexico's, which had won
a 20-year repayment, including a seven-year grace last year at
13/16 points over London interbank offered rates (Libor).
    The Philippines clinched a repayment of 17 years, including
a grace period of 7-1/2 years on 10.3 billion dlrs of its total
debt of 27.8 billion.
    But Fernandez said what was more significant was that
Manila came down from 1-7/8 on the new money and 1-5/8 on the
restructured debt to 7/8 points. Mexico, on the other hand
dropped to 13/16 from 14/16.
    "They got a 1/16 reduction. We got almost a one percentage
point reduction," he said.
    Asked why some features of the debt agreement such as the
token prepayments of principal were not made public
immediately, he said "These are very long documents and in a
press statement you can only cover the key points. But these
will be made available to you."
    Ongpin confirmed on Tuesday that a Reuter report from New
York that Manila will pay its commercial creditors 111 mln dlrs
over 1987-1989 was accurate.
    He omitted the token prepayments in previous announcements
but said there was nothing secret about them.

<TITLE>U.S. TREASURY POLICIES SAID UNCHANGED BY DEPARTURE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Torday</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The departure of James Baker's
closest aide, Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman, will
not change the course of Washington's domestic and
international economic policies, U.S. officials said.
    Darman, who has worked alongside Baker for six years, was
widely credited with helping him mastermind initiatives on
currency management and international economic cooperation.
    U.S. Officials said Darman also played a key role in
shepherding President Reagan's sweeping tax reform plan through
the U.S. Congress.
    But they flatly dismissed suggestions that his departure,
to the investment banking firm of Shearson Lehman Brothers,
signaled the Baker team was breaking up, or that the Treasury
Secretary himself might leave soon.
    "It really does not mean that, he took the opportunity as it
came up," one official said.
    Another commented, "Baker will miss him, but he's not going
to stand in his way."
    There has been widespread speculation since last autumn
that Darman sought a Wall Street job.
    Officials said Darman felt the passage of tax reform late
last year marked an appropriate moment to bow out.
    Baker acknowledged Darman would be sorely missed.
    "Dick Darman has contributed mightily to the success of this
administration over the past six years and his departure
represents a substantial loss," he said.
    U.S. Officials admitted Darman's absence would be an
undoubted blow to Baker, who has relied on him for policy
advice, both at the White House and, in Reagan's second term,
at the Treasury. One aide once described Darman as
"indispensable" to Baker.
    Baker is widely thought to want a more stable currency
system and Darman is generally credited by officials of other
nations as Baker's leading theorist on this issue, favouring
target zones to limit currency fluctuations.
    Earlier this year, monetary sources said the U.S. Treasury
unsuccessfully sounded out allies on a target zone system.
    But a U.S. Official disputed the assessment that, with
Darman gone, Baker would abandon international initiatives.
    Baker's work as head of Reagan's Economic Policy Council,
spearheading trade policy, and his skills in negotiating with
the Democrat-controlled Congress will go on as before.
    Darman's strength was not as an economist, but as a
political strategist "and that's Baker's strength too," the
official said.
    There were already indications that Baker, who throughout
his time in government has relied on a closely-knit circle of
advisers, has moved swiftly to find a successor.
    One possibility is that Baker might turn to George Gould,
who holds the number three Treasury position of
Under-Secretary.
    Gould, another close confidante, has known Baker for years.
    Before joining the Treasury in November 1985, Gould was a
partner at the Wall Steet firm of Wertheim and Co and formerly
headed Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp.
    The Darman announcement came on the eve of the semi-annual
meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank,
where many policies Darman helped shape will be debated.
    He helped Baker devise the September, 1985 Plaza Agreement,
when the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain
curbed the dollar's strength. The pact was a major turning
point in U.S. Policy, ending a period of disdain for economic
cooperation and intervention in currency markets.
    Darman also worked on some other Baker initiatives, like
the Tokyo Summit agreement to intensify coordination of
economic policies among the leading industrial countries and
the recent Paris Agreement to stabilise currencies and
stimulate global growth.
    These policies are collectively aimed at redressing the
huge gap between Japan and West Germany's trade surpluses and
the United State's massive trade deficit.
    That policy goal still remains a prime objective of the
Reagan Administration and will not change with Darman's
departure.

<TITLE>ESCOM SAYS TARGETS MET WITHOUT FOREIGN FINANCE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Christopher Wilson</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    JOHANNESBURG, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Africa's Electricity Supply
Commission (Escom), which last year launched a massive
restructuring programme after the ending of foreign loans to
the country in 1985, said it met its budget targets in 1986
without foreign finance.
    The electricity company, which supplies about 90 pct of
South Africa's power, said in its annual report that it failed
to attract any foreign loans in 1986, but it was confident of
meeting its funding requirements this year, despite available
finance from abroad remaining restricted.
    The utility, which once was South Africa's largest borrower
of foreign funds, said prearranged import financing facilities
are expected to provide foreign funds of only about 300 mln
rand this year. A further 550 mln rand will be borrowed from a
blocked account administered by the South African government
for the eventual repayment of about 13 billion rand in
short-term loans.
    These are currently frozen by an effective moratorium on
repayments. The blocked account is part of a debt accord
recently reached with South Africa's foreign creditor banks.
    South Africa declared a moratorium on repayments of about
14 billion dlrs of its original 24 billion dlr total foreign
debt in September 1985 after foreign bankers abruptly cut off
credit lines to the country because of concern over its
deteriorating political and economic climate.
    Pretoria last week announced that it had reached a
three-year rescheduling agreement with the major international
creditors that will effectively extend a moratorium on most
repayments of the short-term portion of the debt until
mid-1990.
    Escom said it plans to meet the bulk of its funding
requirements this year by raising 2.2 billion rand in the South
African financial markets against a total of 1.75 billion rand
raised last year.
    "The borrowing programme for 1987 is well within the
capacity of the (domestic) financial markets, without pressure
being placed on interest rates," the corporation said.
    "Last year we embarked on the most dramatic restructuring
programme ever attempted by a major South African business, and
we have largely achieved what we set out to do," Escom chairman,
John Maree, told a news conference.

<TITLE>EC MINISTERS WILL DISCUSS STRENGTHENING EMS FLOAT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Tony Carritt, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>European Community finance ministers
and central bankers meet in Belgium this weekend to discuss
strengthening Europe's joint currency float amid continuing
worries about turbulence on foreign exchanges.
    Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens, who will host the
informal talks, told Reuters the ministers and central bank
chiefs would discuss the situation on currency markets in the
light of the February agreement among leading industrialised
countries to stabilise exchange rates around present levels.
    In an interview, Eyskens said he felt the Paris accord
between the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain
and Canada had proved itself "more or less workable."
    But doubts over its effectiveness and durability have been
growing since fears of a trade war between the United States
and Japan over computer microchips pushed the dollar to a
record low against the surging yen early this week.
    The talks, at the Belgian resort of Knokke, are being held
to coordinate the EC's positions on monetary issues and Third
World debt ahead of the Spring meetings of the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington next week.
    The EC gathering begins tonight with a dinner but the main
discussions will take place tomorrow.
    Continued international currency turbulence could undermine
plans for reinforcing the European Monetary System, the joint
float holding eight EC currencies within narrow fluctuation
bands, which will feature high on the weekend agenda.
    Eyskens has repeatedly said that Europe needs a period of
calm on world currency markets, and in particular a more stable
dollar, before it can set about strengthening the EMS to make
it more resilient against exchange rate swings.
    The EMS has been taking a battering over the last year as
the falling dollar has sent funds surging into the dominant EMS
currency, the West German mark, forcing ministers to undertake
two major realignments of parities within nine months.
    In the interview, Eyskens made clear he was hoping for a
wide-ranging discussion on the future of the eight-year-old EMS
on the basis of proposals for bolstering it drawn up by the
EC's Monetary Committee and the Committee of Central Bank
Governors.
    The committees were asked to come up with the proposals
after the last reshuffle of EMS exchange rates in January.
    Eyskens repeated calls for the European Currency Unit, the
fledgling EC currency at the core of the system, to take over
the mark's dominant role in the EMS - a proposal that has met
with a cool response in West Germany.
    He said EC Commission President Jacques Delors would report
to the meeting on problems raised by plans to liberalise
capital movements fully within the 12-nation bloc by 1992, such
as the need for harmonising taxes and banking controls.
    Eyskens said liberalisation of capital movements without
strengthening the EMS would be an element of destabilisation in
the Community. 
    He said the crucial issue in the debate was whether member
states were willing to push further towards the EC's goal of
monetary integration on the basis of an EMS that included
management of exchange rates by some kind of common
institution, instead of by national central banks as at
present.
    Plans for the creation of such an institution, foreseen by
the EMS's founding fathers, have been thwarted by the
reluctance of some countries, notably West Germany, to gove up
their sovereignty in the monetary field.
    EMS development has also been held up by Britain's refusal
so far to join the system's core exchange rate mechanism.

<TITLE>U.S. MARCH JOBLESS RATE FELL TO 6.6 PCT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. civilian unemployment rate
fell to 6.6 pct in March from 6.7 pct in February, the Labor
Department said.
    The number of non-farm payroll jobs rose 164,000 last month
after rising a revised 236,000 in February. That was down from
the previously reported 337,000 rise in February.
    The March unemployment rate was the lowest since March,
1980. It had remained unchanged at 6.7 pct for three straight
months before the March decline.
    The rise in non-farm payrolls was the smallest since a
decline last June of 75,000, the department said.
    Last month's unemployment rate was down from the 7.2 pct
level in March, 1986.
    Growth in jobs continued in March but was slower than in
recent months, with the gains concentrated in service
industries.
    The number of goods-producing jobs fell 68,000 in March,
while service-producing jobs rose 232,000 to bring the total
jobs in the department's survey of businesses to 102.03 mln in
March.
    Business and health services showed the largest gains in
jobs, while manufacturing employment fell by 25,000.
    The average work week fell to 34.8 hours in March from 35.0
hours in February, the department said.
    Manufacturing hours fell to 40.9 per week from 41.2 hours
in February, but overtime hours increased to 3.7 from 3.6.
    The department's survey of households showed the number of
unemployed stood at 7.85 mln out of a work force of 119.2 mln.
    The number of persons working part time for economic
reasons fell in March to 5.46 mln from 5.78 mln in February.
    The loss of factory jobs brought the March total to 19.19
mln jobs and was concentrated in automobile, electrical and
electronic manufacturing.
    Construction employment also lowered the number of jobs in
the goods-producing sector, falling by 45,000 after seasonal
adjustment, the department said.
    Mining employment was little changed in March and has not
experienced any substantial erosion since the rapid job losses
in oil and gas drilling in the first two-thirds of 1986.
    Other service industries that increased jobs last month
were finance, insurance, and real estate.

<TITLE>TALKING POINT/SANTA FE SOUTHERN &lt;SFX></TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Philip Barbara, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp may have
more difficulty combining its two railroads than fending off a
possible takeover by Henley Group &lt;HENG>, which has accumulated
almost a five pct stake in the real estate and railroad
conglomerate, analysts said.
    Takeover speculation has surrounded Santa Fe since Henley
disclosed its stake in the company earlier this week, but
analysts and a Santa Fe official were skeptical a takeover is
its intention.
    Analysts also said the company has strong defenses that
would easily deter any suitor - one of those being its problems
combining its two railroad properties, which hang in regulatory
limbo.
    Richard Fischer of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc said that Santa
Fe at December 31 had 580 mln dlrs in cash and cash
equivalents, while its long-term debt to capital was just over
25 pct. "This gives them plenty of borrowing power," he said,
which could be used against an unwanted suitor.
    Henley Group's Chairman Michael Dingman has said he wants
to take major positions in undervalued natural resource
companies. He also told Reuters in an interview he is seeking
an acquisition of from two billion to eight billion dlrs.
    Santa Fe officials don't appear concerned that Henley might
launch a takeover. "I would not characterize the atmosphere
around here as one of concern," one Santa Fe executive said
about Henley.
    "I think it's wrong to assume Dingman has formed a firm
strategy with Santa Fe," said Mark Hassenberg, who covers
Henley for DLJ Securities.
    Analysts say the potential of Santa Fe's land assets are
likely to be realized slowly. They add that Santa Fe's efforts
to merge its two railroads remain in regulatory limbo,
sidetracking many of its strategic plans for the foreseeable
future.
    These realities, they said, support the Henley Group's
statement that its Santa Fe stake is only an investment.
    The more pressing problem facing Santa Fe is overcoming
difficulties in merging its two railroads, the Atchison, Topeka
and Santa Fe Railway Co and Southern Pacific Transportation Co.
The merger would create the nation's second-longest railroad.
    Last July the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) denied
the merger on anticompetitive grounds.
    The company since has granted trackage-sharing rights to
four western railroads to meet the ICC's concerns and persuade
it to reopen the hearings in its three-year-old struggle to
merge the lines.
    "My guess is the commission will decide in three to six
weeks whether to reopen hearings," Fischer said.
    "I believe they've made an effort to satisfy the ICC's
objections," he said. "But in doing so they haven't pleased
everyone. Before they had Burlington Northern on their side,
now Burlington is opposed to the way trackage rights are set
up."
    If the hearings are reopened, analysts predicted it will
take six to nine months for everyone to have their say, and up
to another year for the ICC to decide.
    Santa Fe is in the midst of a 50-mln-share stock buyback
program begun in 1984. It has bought back 33.7 mln shares as of
February 1, when it had 154.7 mln shares outstanding, a
spokesman said.
    Among the shares repurchased were two stakes owned by
Norfolk Southern, one of 3.4 mln shares bought in 1986 and
another of 1.7 mln shares in 1985, one analyst said.
    James Voytko at Paine Webber believes Santa Fe could fight
off the Henley Group with its cash and credit. Citing the share
buybacks from Norfolk Southern, he said one of Santa Fe's
options, if threatened, could be to buy the Henley stake.
    "It is indeed possible that Dingman sees this as a
low-risk, opportunistic investment," Voytko said.
    "People who follow Santa Fe have given me values of 45 dlrs
to 50 dlrs a share," said DLJ Securities' Hassenberg. "But I'm
certain that in Dingman's mind, the company is worth more than
that in breakup value."

<TITLE>STOLTENBERG CALLS FOR NEW BRAZIL TALKS WITH BANKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said
he will advise Brazil to take up discussions with its
commercial bank creditors when he is in Washington for the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) meeting next week.
    He told a news conference ahead of the IMF talks that
discussions about developing country debt problems would play
an important role on the agenda in Washington.
    Stoltenberg noted that Brazil had agreed in January to work
together with the banks but said this pledge had not yet been
fulfilled.
    After Brazil imposed a moratorium on interest payments on
68 billion dlrs worth of debt in February, Brazilian Finance
Minister Dilson Funaro sought to involve foreign governments in
rescheduling talks with banks.
    But British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson
rebuffed Funaro's bid and said commercial bank loans were a
matter for banks and not governments. West German bankers also
said then that Brazil should seek an understanding with the
IMF.
    Stoltenberg said in Bonn today that he had already told
Funaro that the unilateral moratorium was a mistake.
    Stoltenberg said that despite progress in some areas, the
debt problems of a whole range of countries had recently become
more difficult.
    He said flows from commercial banks had decreased markedly
and that the refusal of some highly indebted countries to
fulfil their commitments to private creditors or with the IMF
was one reason for this.
    He also said that when debtor countries came up with good,
confidence-inspiring policies, commercial banks should react
with more flexibility in interest structures, maturities and
rescheduling.    Many debtor countries had realised that it was not possible
to mobilise capital flows, and especially direct investments,
without such policies, Stoltenberg said.

<TITLE>JAPAN STUDY URGES FOREIGN ACCESS TO FARM MARKETS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan should increase foreign access to
its farm products market, while encouraging further development
of domestic agriculture, a government report said.
    The white paper on agriculture for the year ended March 31
said active participation in writing world farm trade rules at
the next round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
talks will help prepare Japan to improve access.
    Agriculture Ministry sources said the paper marked an
easing in Japan's tough position on agricultural imports which
stressed the need for strict controls on some products to
maintain self-sufficiency in food.
    Japan now produces only 30 pct of its annual grain needs,
down from 61 pct some 20 years ago, official figures show.
    The paper said Japanese agriculture has been slow to
improve productivity and demand/supply imbalances.
    The relative shortage of farmland in Japan is mainly
responsible for higher domestic prices, it said.
    The strong yen has meant lower input material prices but
has also resulted in higher agricultural imports which has
worsened working conditions among part-time farmers, the paper
said.
    This could make it difficult to improve the industry's
structure, the paper said.
    To solve these problems and to reduce farm product prices
to more reasonable levels, Japan should try to restructure the
the agricultural sector to improve productivity and make it
self-supporting, it said.

the 10.3 billion dlr debt restructuring package he and Finance
Secretary Jaime Ongpin negotiated with the Philippines'
commercial creditors was better than Mexico's.
    "I think we got a better deal. It was really an enormous
drop, a reduction in rates and that to me is the critical
element," he told Reuters.
    He was reacting to comments by local economists who said
Manila's debt accord was no better than Mexico's, which was a
20-year repayment, including a seven-year grace last year at
13/16 points over London interbank offered rates (Libor).
    The Philippines clinched a repayment of 17 years, including
a grace period of 7-1/2 years on 10.3 billion dlrs of its total
debt of 27.8 billion.

months' wages to quit the firm because jungle-based rebels have

in the few minutes after news that the U.S. Non-farm payroll
rose more slowly than earlier believed over the last two
months, dealers said.
    June T-bonds were trading at 97-2/32, or 31/32 down on the
day, immediately before the figures. When the news came out,
they made session highs of 97-17/32 before slipping to 97-

    The payroll rose by 164,000 in March, against analysts'
expectations of a 225,000 gain, while the Labour Department
revised the February increase down to 236,000 from 337,000.

billion at the end of 1985, Belgian National Bank figures

money to 679.5 billion from 652.7 billion and 616.0 billion.
    Money held by the public authorities fell to 56.8 billion
francs from 68.6 billion at the end of the previous quarter but
was above the 55.5 billion at the end of 1985, the bank said.
    The government does not set money supply targets, arguing
they are inappropriate to a small economy with major trading
and monetary links with much larger trading countries.

<TITLE>STOLTENBERG SAYS PARIS ACCORD POLICY TO CONTINUE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg said the currency agreement reached in Paris in
February had been successful and would be continued.
    Stoltenberg told journalists before he attends next week's
International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington that: "The ...
Strategy to stabilise currencies around current levels has
proven its worth and will also determine future developments."
    Stoltenberg declined to comment specifically on what he
would consider to be an undervalued dollar but said a dollar
around 1.80 marks created problems for West Germany's exports.
    He said studies by international organisations had made it
clear that especially in the U.S. And in Japan major efforts
remained necessary to support adjustments in foreign trade
balances via necessary corrections to economic policy.
    "No-one would benefit if, after years of over-valuation, the
U.S. Dollar fell into the other extreme, that is, strong
under-valuation," he said.
    Stoltenberg said West Germany had a keen interest in a
swift agreement between the U.S. And Japan concerning the
current trade dispute over semi-conductors.
    Asked whether he believed the markets would test the Paris
currency accord, Stoltenberg did not comment specifically but
noted that much of what had been discussed in Paris had not
been published.
    The Paris declaration did not state the levels at which
central banks of the major industrialised countries would
intervene. Stoltenberg said that everything had been carefully
considered. He said he had nothing further to add.

<TITLE>IMF, WORLD BANK TO MEET AMID NEW INFLATION FEARS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alver Carlson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Amid new concerns about inflation,
interest rate increases and trade confrontations,
finance ministers and central bankers meet next week to discuss
a deteriorating global debt and economic situation.
    The meetings, under the auspices of the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank, come as interest rates are
turning higher and the already-weak dollar has sunk further,
upsetting bond and stock markets.
    Uncertainty is growing about the vitality of the global
economy and whether the heavily-indebted countries can continue
to carry the burden of their growing debt without vast new
assistance.
    Monetary and diplomatic sources said there are no signs
any new debt initiative of the sort that Treasury Secretary
James Baker unveiled 18 months ago in Seoul is in the works.
    The strategy has drawn a serious challenge from Brazil,
which suspended interest payments on 67 billion dlrs of
commercial bank debt last month. The Banks have responded by
laying the groundwork for writing down Brazilian loans.
    Separately, French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, in a
visit earlier this week with President Reagan, sounded out the
administration on a plan to funnel worldwide grain surpluses to
the very poorest states.
    The French plan is certain to be discussed by the ministers
in detail during next week's meetings and will undoubtedly be
embraced by the developing countries.
    "There's interest on the part of some countries for looking
at the support of the special problems of the very poorest
countries, because their position is so extreme," a Reagan
administration official said.
    He suggested Washington was open to disussing the issue.
    The meetings will also assess the success of the Baker debt
initiative, which called for new funding to help debtor
countries grow out of their problems.
    The largest industrial countries have been attempting to
coordinate economic policy in the hope of controlling the
decline of the dollar, U.S. trade and budget deficits and other
problems.
    At the same time, the industrial countries see little
evidence of a strengthening of economic activity and the Fund
forecasts they will grow 2.5 pct.
    The United States sees 3.2 pct growth for itself, 
continuing its expansion for a fifth year, and has asked other
industrial countries to stimulate their economies.
    These issues directly affect the debt problem and the
ability of the debtor countries to grow out of their
difficulties.
    In recent years, U.S. markets have absorbed the exports of
developing country, allowing them to earn critical foreign
exchange. But the United States wants to cut its trade deficit,
running at a record 169.8 billion dlrs, and is pressing others
to import more from developing countries.
    The discussions, from April six to 10, will be
wide-ranging, touching everything from interest rates to the
impact of development loans on the environment, according to
monetary sources.
    The talks will include an examination of trade
protectionist pressures in the wake of a decision by the Reagan
administration to place some 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on
microchip products from Japan, the sources said.
    The move accelerated the dollar's decline as financial
markets grew alarmed that trade war was in the offing.
    There is concern that the action, prompted by U.S. charges
that Japan has been selling computer chip products below fair
market value and has kept its own market closed to imports,
further undermining the international trading system.
    At the same time, the ministers will discuss the
fundamental price weakness in basic commodities, the export
mainstay of many developing countries.
    The so-called Group of Five industrial countries -- the
United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain -- will
gather for the first time since their February talks in Paris,
where they agreed to keep the dollar from sliding further.
    The Five will be joined later by Italy and Canada for
further debate on economic policy coordination.
    As part of the Paris accord, surplus countries such as
Japan agreed to stimulate their economies, while America
said it would reduce its federal budget deficit.
    Other major issues of the meetings include a U.S. bid to to
have a larger say in approving loans of the Inter-American
Development Bank, strengthening the link between loans and
economic policy changes in debtor nations.
    Washington is also pressing the World Bank to take more
account of the environment when making loan for dams and other
projects.
    The new head of the Bank, Barber Conable, has said this
issue is being reviewed and will be part of a reorganization
plan for the Bank, now being prepared.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Active timecharter fixing by Soviet
operators to cover USSR grain imports featured the freight
market, ship brokers said.
    At least two fixtures were reported on Soviet account to
lift EC grain, with a 22,000 tonner booked from Tilbury for a
voyage via lower Baltic Sea and redelivery passing Skaw at
4,000 dlrs daily and a 27,000 tonner from Ceuta for a voyage
via the U.K. And redelivery Skaw-Cape Passero at 4,500 dlrs
daily.
    The Soviets also secured a 34,000 tonner from Gibraltar for
a trans-Atlantic round trip at 4,500 dlrs daily and a 61,000
tonner for similar business at 6,750 dlrs daily.
    Brokers said several other fixtures were also thought to be
connected with Soviet grain, including a 69,000 tonner from
Taranto for five to seven months at 6,500 dlrs daily. Similar
fixing was reported yesterday at 6,000 dlrs.
    Other timecharter fixing included a 14,000 tonner from
Indonesia to the U.S. Gulf at 2,800 dlrs daily and a combined
carrier of 75,000 tonnes dw from the U.S. Gulf to Italy at
9,000 dlrs daily.
    Severel vessels were booked from Antwerp-Hamburg range,
including a 61,000 tonner bound for Singapore-Japan at 7,500
dlrs daily and a 16,000 tonner destined for west coast India at
5,000 dlrs.
    Grain fixing was much quieter out of the U.S. Gulf, with no
fresh business seen on the significant routes to the Continent
or Japan, although tonnage was secured for at least five small
corn cargoes from the Gulf to Jamaica at between 21 and 25
dlrs. Wheat from the River Plate and Buenos Aires to Sri Lanka
received 26 dlrs.
    Market talk suggested 11 dlrs had been paid for grain from
the U.S. North Pacific to Japan but no confirmation was
available.
    Fairly active grain fixing emerged out of the Continent,
however, with maize covered from Nantes to Egypt at 15 dlrs,
and bagged flour from Greece to China at 27 dlrs.
    Barley cargoes were arranged from Immingham to the Red Sea
at 17.25 dlrs and from Foynes to Jeddah at 17.25 dlrs.

mine fire that killed one miner and trapped 44 others for

    The fire, which started Wednesday and burned for more than

officials said.
    Michel Lefebvre, vice president of operations, said Noranda
will operate the mine at about one third of its normal 72,000
short ton annual finished capacity, using above ground
reserves, until it decides whether to keep the mine open.
    "The events we sustained yesterday and the day before are a
very serious setback for Gaspe Mines operations," Lefebvre said.
Gaspe Mines is the name of the Noranda division that operates
the Murdochville mine.
    He said it would take four or five months to bring
operations up to full capacity if the company decides to do so,
adding that he believes there is a good chance Noranda will
fully reopen the mine.

    Specifically, General Partners said it was prepared to
discuss an acquisition giving shareholders a continuing

<DATELINE>    MADRID, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Greece has agreed to buy between 27,000
and 33,000 tonnes of Spanish corn, a spokesman for Cargill's
Spanish unit Compania Industrial y de Abastecimiento S.A.
(CINDASA) said.
    He told Reuters the sale price was around 28.95 pesetas per
kilo but that the final quantity and delivery date has not yet
been set. The corn will be shipped in the coming days from
Valencia.
    He said CINDASA will also ship 6,000 to 7,000 tonnes of
Spanish corn to Italy in the second half of this month.
    The CINDASA spokesman said other corn shipments this month
will include between 15,000 and 30,000 tonnes bound initially
for Rotterdam and Ghent and destined for unspecified northern
European countries. He said shipments of 35,000 to 50,000
tonnes of low specific gravity barley were also expected this
month and added that Greece, the Netherlands, Ireland and
Belgium were considering imports of Spanish flour for milling.
    Market sources said the corn exports, the absence of
imports from the rest of the EC and the delay in shipments of
corn from the U.S. Had pushed domestic corn prices up by around
0.25 pesetas a kilo today compared with yesterday.

<TITLE>BUNDESBANK GROSS RESERVES RISE AT MARCH CLOSE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bundesbank's gross currency
reserves rose 300 mln marks in the last week of March to 104.9
billion marks, the Bundesbank said in a statement.
    At the same time its foreign liabilities rose 100 mln to
22.8 billion, producing a rise in net reserves of 200 mln to
82.2 billion on March 31.
    The Bundesbank provided banks with liquidity in the fourth
March week by disbursing funds in the money market via
government-owned banks. Banks took up the Bundesbank's standing
offer of treasury bills to place excess liquidity.
    Banks received more liquidity through routine month-end
payments by public authorities as well as expansionary market
factors than was lost through the 2.3 billion mark rise in cash
in circulation to 122.3 billion, the Bundesbank said.
    But banks had to draw heavily on the Lombard emergency
financing facility due to month-end tightness, borrowing 5.3
billion marks.
    Overall, banks' holdings at the Bundesbank rose 10.2
billion marks to 58.5 billion at the end of the month,
averaging 50.9 billion in the whole of March.
    The minimum reserve requirement for March, before deduction
of banks' cash holdings, was set at 61 billion marks.
    Public authorities' net holdings at the Bundesbank fell to
2.2 billion marks in the last March week from 4.4 billion the
week before. The federal states' holdings fell 2.6 billion to
2.4 billion.
    The federal government's holdings rose 700 mln marks to 5.1
billion.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>WESSANEN FORESEES STRONG PROFIT GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AMSTERDAM, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dutch dairy and general foods
manufacturer Koninklijke Wessanen NV &lt;WESS.AS>, said it is
planning further world-wide acquisitions and forsees strong
profit growth over the next 10 years.
     Company chairman Gerrit van Driel told journalists at the
presentation of Wessanen's 1986 report he already expected 1987
first quarter profits to show an increase.
    The company last month reported a 16 pct increase in 1986
net profits to 72.7 mln guilders, after 62.3 mln in 1985.
    This was achieved despite a 25 pct drop in the dollar's
guilder value, van Driel said.
    Van Driel said profits would have been nine mln guilders
higher if the US currency had remained at its average 1985
level of 3.20 guilders.
    Turnover, at 3.7 billion guilders in 1986, was 450 mln
guilders down because of the lower dollar and lower raw
material prices. Total 1985 turnover was 4.2 billion guilders.
    US activities accounted for 34 pct of 1986 turnover,
compared with 22 pct in 1982. Wessanen now has 15 separate
businesses in the US out of a total of 62 world-wide.
    Van Driel said the company would continue an active
takeover policy in the US, but would be wary about paying more
than its current price/earnings ratio of 17 times net profit.
    He added that Wessanen teams were seeking acquisition
possibilities in Brazil, Taiwan, Thailand and China.
    He said the company had an ample cashflow of 100 mln
guilders and would if necessary make new share issues.
    Van Driel said he expected a 1987 US turnover of 700 mln
dlrs. He said &lt;Balanced Foods> and &lt;Green's Dairy>, taken over
late last year, have a combined annual turnover of 126 mln dlrs
which was not included in the 1986 account.
    All sectors saw strong growth in 1986, resulting in a 13
pct increase in operating income to 120 mln guilders. Key to
this growth was the successful introduction of new products,
which were greatly enhanced by a number of consumer-oriented US
acquisitions, van Driel said.
    Consumer products represented 50 pct of total 1986
turnover, compared with 35 pct in 1982, van Driel said.
    The company, which is already listed on the London, Zurich,
Basle and Geneva stock exchanges as well as Amsterdam, aims to
be quoted in Frankfurt and Dusseldorf in May, van Driel said.
    Van Driel stressed that while these listings would not be
accompanied by new share issues, they provided easy vehicles
for the company to raise capital for future expansion.
    He estimated that 33 pct of the company's shares were in
foreign hands.
    The company's 1986 US turnover of about 750 mln dlrs made a
listing on one of the New York exchanges a logical next step,
van Driel said without elaborating.
    Despite EC dairy restrictions Wessanen, which produces
around 10 pct of all Dutch cheese, saw good growth prospects
for its dairy sector within Europe, van Driel said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>PAKISTAN NOT SEEN AS MAJOR WHEAT EXPORTER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ISLAMABAD, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pakistan is not emerging as a major
wheat exporter as world market prospects are not good enough,
Sartaj Aziz, Special Assistant on Food and Agriculture to the
Pakistani Prime Minister, said in an interview.
    No exports are planned for the next 12 months or so and
plans last year to sell one mln tonnes to Iran came to nothing
because they could not agree a price, he said.
    Aziz forecast that Pakistan may have exportable surpluses
of one mln tonnes or a half mln tonnes over the next few
harvests in years when the weather is favourable.
    The government does not wish to increase output much above
this because of low world prices, and the land would be better
used for other crops.
    Aziz said the Pakistani government does not want area sown
to wheat to increase from the current seven mln hectares. Some
10 pct of that area which gives low yields could be switched to
more profitable crops such as oilseeds.
    The aim is to concentrate on raising yields from the
current 1.8 to 1.9 tonnes per ha to at least 2.5 tonnes per ha
over the next five to seven years, he said.
    Aziz said the current 1986/87 crop, harvesting of which is
just beginning, is expected to yield around a record 14.5 mln
tonnes. This compares with a target of 14.7 mln and last year's
yield of 14.0 mln.
    He said rains some six weeks ago helped the crop but more
recent rains reduced prospects slightly.
    The long-term wheat production target is for some 17 mln
tonnes by mid-1993, taking into account Pakistan's annual
population growth rate of more than three pct. Current
consumption is some 12.5 mln tonnes.
    The current wheat reserve is 2.5 mln tonnes, Aziz said.
This compares with a minimum reserve commitment of one mln
tonnes, which Pakistan will maintain at all costs, and a
"strategic reserve" target of two mln tonnes.
    Despite the fact that stocks are a half-mln tonnes over
target, the surplus will not be exported at present, he said.
    The government wants to keep an extra "safety margin" until
it sees what effect the abolition of a 44-year-old wheat
rationing system will have on domestic consumption. New exports
will be considered only in about a year's time when the 1987/88
crop can be gauged as well, he said.
    The new domestic policy, introduced on March 15, is for the
government to supply unlimited quantities of wheat at two
rupees per kilo. With other costs this means a price in
Pakistani markets of between 2.30 and 2.50 rupees per kilo.
    Under the old system, introduced during World War Two and
due to be phased out by April 15, some 50 mln ration cards were
issued enabling poor people to buy wheat cheaply.
    Aziz said following the introduction of a government
support price in the 1970s the system become so corrupted that
only 20 to 25 pct of subsidised wheat was actually reaching the
consumer, the rest being diverted illicitly to the mills.
    The ration system had also not had the stabilising effect
on the internal wheat market that was intended, Aziz said.
    Prices have already begun to fall with the introduction of
the new system. The wheat price in Karachi, the most expensive
Pakistani city, had dropped from 3.11 rupees per kilo on March
1 to 2.85 rupees on March 30.
    Aziz said he does not expect the change in system to have a
major effect on total consumption, but it may encourage better
use of side-products such as bran.

<TITLE>ABNORMAL RADIATION FOUND IN SOVIET TEA/HAZELNUTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MOSCOW, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Abnormally high levels of radiation were
found in Soviet tea and hazelnuts more than nine months after
the Chernobyl nuclear accident, West German residents in Moscow
were advised this week.
    In a letter to the West German community here, Ambassador
Joerg Kastl said laboratory tests on food samples bought in
Moscow in February had shown elevated levels of caesium-134 and
-137 in tea from Azerbaijan and Ukrainian hazelnuts.
    Other food samples sent for testing at Cologne University,
including honey, fruit, vegetables, pork, milk and butter, were
found to be free of radiation, it said.
    Data in the letter showed the tea and hazelnuts contained
caesium levels far in excess of ceilings recommended by the
United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).
    The letter said people who had consumed the tea faced no
particular health danger as most of the caesium remained in the
tea leaves, but it warned against eating the hazelnuts.
    The products sent for testing were bought in state shops
and private farmers' markets in Moscow, it added. Other Western
embassies in Moscow said they had discontinued laboratory
testing of Soviet food late last year because no abnormal
radiation levels were detected.
    "We didn't find anything so we stopped doing it," a U.S.
Embassy spokesman said.
    A British spokesman said radiation-monitoring equipment
remained in the embassy waiting room for British residents in
Moscow who wanted to check their food, but laboratory tests had
not been conducted for several months.
    "Earlier we sent some food back to Britain as a
precautionary measure, but we stopped in the absence of any
alarming signals," he said. "If the tests had shown abnormal
readings, they would have been resumed."

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>TIME &lt;TL> 1987 EARNINGS MAY BE 4.25 DLRS SHARE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Time Inc's chief financial officer,
Thayer Bigelow, told security analysts the company is
"comfortable" with Wall Street estimates that 1987 earnings
will be in a range of 3.75 dlrs to 4.25 dlrs per share.
    In 1986, Time reported earnings of 5.95 dlrs per share,
including a number of special items.
    Bigelow said in adjusting the 1986 results for the special
items and also removing the earnings of American Television and
Communications Corp &lt;ATCMA>, Time earned 2.35 dlrs per share in
1986.
    Turner Broadcasting System Inc said the investment by the
cable consortium would be in Turner Broadcasting, not directly
in CNN. The consortium would infuse up to 550 mln dlrs in
Turner Broadcasting in return for a 35 pct equity interest.
    Ted Turner, Chairman, would retain a 51 pct interest, a
Turner Broadcasting spokesman said.
    Bigelow said the company is continuing its previously
announced 10 mln share repurchase program and has bought back
4.1 mln of its own shares. He said 700,000 shares were
purchased in the first quarter of 1987 at an average price of
81 dlrs per share.
    Bigelow said the company will always have a share buyback
program in place whenever it believes it is a better long-term
investment than starting or acquring a business. But he did not
give any specifics on further repurchases beyond the 10 mln
shares already announced.
   
    On the subject of acquisitions, Richard Munro, chairman and
chief executive said the company is not interested in investing
in over-the-air broadcasting, but continues to look at all
areas in which it is currently engaged.
    Munro said book publishing is an area that interested Time.
In 1986 the company purchased Scott and Foresman, its biggest
acquisition ever.
    N.J. Nicholas, president and chief operating officer, said
the company might be interested in a relatively small book
business.
    He said following the recent agreement for the sale of
Harper and Row to the News Corp Ltd &lt;NWS>, "there may be pieces
that Murdoch doesn't want," referring to News Corp chairman
Rupert Murdoch.
    Asked if the company's SAMI business is for sale, Munro
said it is a "delicate subject", and "we're looking at all the
options." SAMI is a marketing information service for the food
industry. Published reports have stated it could be worth as
much as 500 mln dlrs.
   
    Bigelow said that Time's Home Box Office added  subscribers
last year and the trend is continuing in the first quarter of
1987. However, he said, HBO's results in the quarter will be
down slightly, but in the first quarter of 1986 there was a
special gain in the HBO unit.
    Nicholas said that HBO and Cinemax had combined subscriber
growth of 800,000 for last year.
    He also said the tax rate in 1987 will remain at just under
50 pct because of the repeal of investment tax credits and
higher state and local taxes. He said he sees a decrease in the
tax rate in 1988 of five or six percentage points.
    Munro said the company does not plan to increase its
dividend.
    Trygve Myhren, chairman and chief executive of American
Television and Communications, said the unit is looking at
getting involved in the home shopping video area. "It would be
foolish not to be a player there," he said.
    He said the company had talks with Home Shopping Network
Inc &lt;HSN> prior to that company's public offering last year,
but nothing came of the talks.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Reserve is expected to take
no reserve-management action in the U.S. Government securities
market during its usual intervention period, economists said.
    They said that, if the Fed does act, it will likely add
temporary reserves indirectly by arranging one to 1.5 billion
dlrs of customer repurchase agreements.
    Federal funds, which averaged 6.14 pct yesterday, opened at
5-15/16 pct and remained there in early trading. Analysts
believe this probably is about where the Fed wants the funds
rate to be.

upgraded the ratings on four billion dlrs of debt of Coastal

    S and P cited Coastal's success in reducing debt and
preferred stock by 390 mln dlrs last year, despite weak energy
prices. As debt is repaid, pretax interest coverage should rise
gradually from the current depressed 1.4 times level.
    Raised were Coastal's notes, debentures and Eurobonds to
BB-minus from B-plus and subordinated debt and preferred to
B-plus from B-minus. S and P upgraded the units Wycon Chemical
Corp and ANR Finance N.V./B.V.
    Wycon Chemical's industrial revenue bonds, guaranteed by
the parent, were raised to BB-minus from B-plus.
    S and P upgraded ANR Finance's Euronotes to BB-minus from
B-plus, ANR Pipeline Co's first mortgage bonds to BB-plus from
BB, debentures and Eurobonds to BB-minus from B-plus and
preferred to BB from B-plus.
    Also, Colorado Interstate Gas Co's first mortgage bonds
were raised to BB-plus from BB and debentures to BB-minus from
B-plus, while the unit's preferred was affirmed at BB.
    A manageable debt maturity schedule for the next few years
mitigates concern over Coastal's capital structure, S/P said.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L> said
it had no plans to close its refinery in Gothenburg, despite
forecasts by a Swedish finance ministry committee that it might
be planning such a move.
    The committee said the refinery's future looked bleak
because the Swedish petroleum industry's competitiveness was
expected to worsen unless it invested, and because of the
effects of a possible tightening of rules on sulphur content.
    But BP said the unit, in which Sweden's &lt;OK Petroleum AB>
has a 22 pct stake, had performed well both technically and
financially up to and including the first quarter of 1987.
    Current restrictions on sulphur emissions and known future
plans for both Sweden and export markets did not cause it any
serious problems, it said in a statement.
    The refinery started up in 1967 and has an annual capacity
of 4.7 mln tonnes.

<TITLE>USDA CORRECTS TURKEY CREDIT ANNOUNCEMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Agriculture Department said
an announcement by the department yesterday concerning 15.0 mln
dlrs in additional credit guarantees for exports of U.S.
commodities to Turkey contained two inaccuracies.
    First, the USDA said its announcement should not have said
that plywood was excluded from the additional three mln dlrs in
GSM-102 credit guarantees for lumber.
    The original announcement said the guarantees included
three mln dlrs for lumber, except plywood.
    Melvin Sims, USDA general sales manager, told Reuters he
did not anticipate any plywood would be included in the sales,
but that "it's possible it would be."
    Plywood in the past has not been eligible for GSM-102
credit guarantees because it is considered by some to be a
manufactured product. Members states of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development have pledged not to offer
concessional credits on manufactured products, Sims said.
    However, the Reagan administration is considering whether
to allow plywood sales to be covered by the credit guarantee
program, Sims said.
    Second, the USDA announcement said 6.0 mln dlrs of a
previously announced 6.0-mln dlr line for tallow under GSM-102
was available for both public and private sector importers.
    In fact, the line of credit guarantees for tallow is
available only for public sector importers, Walter Stern,
Foreign Agricultural Service Turkey analyst, said.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Moody's Investors Service Inc said it
raised to B-1 from B-2 Chicago Pacific Corp's 315 mln dlrs of
subordinated notes.
    The agency said the rating recognizes risks in Chicago
Pacific's highly leveraged balance sheet, uncertainty arising
from its consideration of another sizable acquisition and
exposure to the European appliance industry.
    Moody's said the units Hoover and Rowenta have leading
market positions. Debt to capital will be slightly more than 60
pct pro forma, but since Chicago Pacific's plant is modern,
capital spending is considered largely discretionary, it said.

<TITLE>PLYWOOD CREDITS EYED BY REAGAN ADMINISTRATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Reagan administration is debating
whether to provide government credit guarantees for the export
of plywood, a U.S. Agriculture Department official said.
    As a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development, OECD, the United States has agreed not to
provide any concessional credits on the export of manufactured
products.
    However, USDA General Sales Manager Melvin Sims told
Reuters the administration is considering allowing USDA to
provide its first export credit guarantees for plywood on the
grounds it is not a manufactured product.
    Sims said it was clear that wood products such as
furniture, tables and window frames would be considered
manufactured goods and therefore ineligible for export credit
guarantees. However, the case of plywood was less clear.
    "As long as it's a basic material, we consider it still just
a processed version of the basic agricultural commodity," Sims
said in a telephone interview.
    Earlier today, USDA said that plywood was eligible under an
export credit guarantee offer for Turkey announced yesterday.
In its original announcement yesterday, USDA had said the offer
included three mln dlrs for the export of lumber, excluding
plywood. However, Sims said he did not expect any plywood
exports to be including under the lumber guarantee offer.

    The Treasury said it had closed the offer early in view of

estimated state borrowing requirement for the current month.
    The CCTs were priced at 99.00 pct for an effective net
annual yield on the first coupon, payable April 1 1988, of 9.85

output at its Joe Mann mine in the Chibougamu area of Quebec at
an initial daily rate of 500 short tons of ore grading 0.15

    It said it will improve throughput to 700 tons a day at

copper, but it may be able to develop "substantially greater
tonnage."
  
    Meston said underground drilling below current developed
reserves has intersected the main zone 200 feet below the
bottom level, with the average grade assayed at 0.530 ounce of
gold per ton over true width of 17 feet.
    A recent drillhole, east of the current shaft and 600 feet

respectively, 0.708 ounce per ton over 5.4 feet at depth of 650
feet, 0.706 ounce over seven feet at depth of 765 feet and
0.418 ounce over one foot at depth of 1,000 feet. A second

<TITLE>EXCHANGE SEEN APPROVING "WHEN ISSUED" GILT TRADE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Sandy Critchley, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Stock Exchange is virtually certain
to agree to change its regulations in order to permit "when
issued" trading of U.K. Government bonds (gilts) as part of an
experimental series of bond auctions later this year, market
sources said.
    "The principle that this "when issued' trading should take
place has been accepted by the Executive Committee of the
International Stock Exchange," said George Nissen, chairman of
the Gilt Edged Market Makers' Association (GEMMA). "It's a
question of how, rather than whether," he told Reuters.
    The Bank of England announced in February that it planned a
possible series of experimental auctions for gilts, similar to
the system used to market U.S. Treasury issues, with the first
auction possibly in April or May.
     The Bank said at that stage that it was not opposed in
principle to "when issued" trading developing in bonds in the
period between the announcement of full details of the auction
and the auction itself, as in the U.S.
    However, "when issued" trading is prohibited under the rules
of the International Stock Exchange, formerly the London Stock
Exchange, and would require an amendment in order to proceed.
    Nissen said discussions on the technical details of a rule
change to allow "when issued" trading were still taking place
between the Government broker at the Bank of England and the
Quotations Department of the Stock Exchange.
    The 27 gilt-edged primary dealers regard the introduction
of grey market trading as an essential feature of an auction
system covering part of the Government's funding needs.
    "If we are going into an auction system, we need to have
some form of market test of the stock we're bidding for," said
Simon Hartnell, Head Trader at primary dealer Alexanders Laing
and Cruickshank Gilts Ltd.
    "The American WI (when issued) market certainly functions
very efficiently," he said.
    Nissen said he believed that if "when issued" trading were
not allowed, market-makers "would be extremely unhappy about the
whole auction."
    Gilt dealers noted that it was a basic provision of Stock
Exchange rules that dealing could not take place in a stock
until it was listed by the Quotations Department. However, this
was mainly designed to prevent a grey market springing up in
equities prior to listing.
    They pointed out that in contrast to the many uncertainties
connected with an issue of equity securities, there would be
few imponderables relating to bonds just about to be issued by
the Bank of England.
    Senior market sources noted that in any case "when issued"
trading would be supervised by the Stock Exchange and would be
subject to Bank of England supervisory guidelines.
    Since the Bank of England and market-makers themselves are
known to be in favour of the idea, the sources said, there was
now a presumption that there would be scope for "when issued"
trading to take place.
    Gilt sales now are effected by means of large-scale stock
tenders or by tap issues of stock tranches direct to the
market. But greater market capitalisation following the "Big
Bang" restructuring last year provided an opportunity for
change.
    A combination of both systems would enable the Bank to
benefit from both the flexibility offered by traditional
marketing methods and the guarantee of a steady supply of funds
implied by auctions.
    The Bank said in a consultative document published in
February that possibly two or three experimental auctions might
each raise between one to 1-1/2 billion stg.
    The remainder of the funding would be conducted by
traditional tender and tap issue means. Total gross official
sales of gilt-edged stock were 11.9 billion stg in 1985/86.
    Nissen said that market-makers had agreed unanimously with
the bank's view that auctions would be more easily conducted on
a price basis, rather than based on yield.
    He said that the odds were also in favour of adoption of a
bid price form of auction, where successful bidders were
allotted stock at the various prices at which they bid, rather
than a common price allotment whereby stock was allocated at
the lowest accepted price.
    Hartnell said that while a "when issued" facility was crucial
to market-makers' adaptation to the new system, he would also
have liked to see an extension to the "fallow" period proposal
made by the Bank of England.
    The Bank said that it would not sell by any method stock of
the same type as that to be auctioned between the time of the
announcement of auction details and a period ending 28 days
after the auction itself.
    Noting that in the case of long bond auctions, U.S. Primary
dealers have as much as three months between successive sales
of stock, Hartnell said the Bank's proposal was "very tight."
    Nissen said that following a meeting between GEMMA and the
Bank of England on March 3, which he described as "very helpful,"
GEMMA submitted a note making several further residual points.
    Market-makers are now awaiting a further, fairly
definitive, paper from the Bank which would contain details of
auction procedures. Although the Bank has not yet formally
announced a definite intention to proceed with the auctions,
most market participants assume that they will go ahead.
    "My own view is that we are on course and the first
indications from the original paper - an auction at the end of
April or in May - must be the best assumption," he said.

<TITLE>EC WHEAT RELEASE UNLIKELY TO SATISFY U.K. DEMAND</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Kenneth Brettell, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Commission's decision to
release an additional 300,000 tonnes of British intervention
feed wheat for the home market will provide only moderate
relief in an increasingly tight market, traders said.
    Some operators had been anticipating a larger tonnage,
pointing out that at this week's U.K. Intervention tender the
market sought to buy 340,000 tonnes but only 126,000 tonnes
were granted.
    The new tranche of intervention grain is unlikely to
satisfy demand, they said, and keen buying competition for
supplies in stores is expected to keep prices firm.
    The release of the feed wheat followed recent strong
representations by the U.K. Grain trade to the Commission.
There has been growing concern that rising internal prices,
triggered by heavy exports, were creating areas of shortage in
interior markets.
    The latest EC authorisation will add 70,000 tonnes at the
April 14 tender and a further 30,000 tonnes later in the month.
The remaining 200,000 tonnes will be made available in May and
June.
    News of the release produced an early downward reaction in
local physical markets, but by midday some sections had halved
early two stg losses while others were unchanged.
    Ministry of Agriculture figures for March indicate 1.85 mln
tonnes of wheat and 1.74 mln tonnes of barley remain in the
free market. However, some traders believe these figures are
overstated and, while some may still be held on the farm, the
bulk of wheat is already sold. Some of the grain is also off
the market in futures stores.
    A total of 2.10 mln tonnes of intervention wheat has been
sold for export or to the home market since the season started
July 1, leaving an unsold balance in intervention of about 1.59
mln tonnes.
    Intervention barley sales have reached just over 1.0 mln
tonnes, leaving about 753,000 tonnes, traders said.
    This season's U.K. Export performance has surpassed all
early expectations and has created the present nervous
situation in domestic markets where the fear now is free market
supplies may not last out until new crop becomes available in
August.
    The market is sticking to its recent prediction of total
barley and wheat exports of around 10.5 mln tonnes, a new
record and nearly double the previous record of 5.9 mln tonnes
achieved in the 1984/85 season.
    Traders expect U.K. Wheat exports to reach 6.0 mln and
barley around 4.50 mln tonnes.
    The Soviet Union has booked a record total of 2.5 mln
tonnes of British wheat and barley this season, but only 1.28
mln had surfaced in Customs export figures by March 25, traders
said.
    Other EC countries have bought large amounts of British
grain and for the July 1/March 25 period had taken 2.59 mln
tonnes of wheat and 2.06 mln tonnes of barley. This compares
with 1.28 mln and 868,700 tonnes last season.
    The market is expecting prices, particularly wheat, to stay
buoyant for the remaining few months of the season. If supplies
become more difficult and prices strengthen further, feed
compounders may increase cereal substitute usage, traders said.

<TITLE>PORTUGAL'S GDP FORECAST TO GROW FOUR PCT THIS YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LISBON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Portugal's Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
will grow around four pct this year, the same rate as in 1986,
according to a Bank of Portugal forecast.
    Total investment this year, the country's second as a
member of the European Community (EC), will rise nearly 10 pct,
again the same rate as last year, the central bank study said.
    It added that Portugal's current account was forecast to
show a surplus of 400 mln dlrs this year compared with 1.13
billion in 1986 and 369 mln the previous year.
    Last year's high surplus was attributed to cheaper oil and
raw materials, lower world interest rates and a weaker dollar.
    Imports by volume were forecast to grow 10 pct this year
and exports four pct compared with increases of 16.5 pct and
6.6 pct respectively in 1986, the bank said.
    The forecasts were calculated on the assumption that the
non-expansionary monetary policy carried out by the current
government would be maintained, particularly in budget spending
and income and in wage policy.
    The bank added that the 1987 forecasts were also based on
the assumption that the international economic situation and
Portugal's world trade relations would remain more or less the
same as in 1986.
    The central bank said the high rate of investment estimated
for 1986 was due to government policies and to increasing
optimism among firms whose financial situation had improved
since 1985. This tendency was expected to continue this year,
especially in the construction and public works sectors.
    Financial aid from the EC had also helped to boost
investment last year, the bank said.

<TITLE>NORANDA MINE SEEN BELOW FULL OUTPUT FOR MONTHS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MURDOCHVILLE, Quebec, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Noranda Inc said production
will remain shut down at its fire-damaged copper mine here
until it can completely examine the mine.
    If it decides to keep the mine open it would take four or
five months before it could resume full production.
    Company spokesman Dale Coffin said the investigation could
take from a few days to several weeks but would not be more
specific.
    Noranda said when it resumes production it plans to operate
the mine at about one-third of the normal 72,000 tonnes annual
finished capacity.
    The fire, which started Wednesday and burned itself out
late yesterday weakened part of the mine's support structure,
Coffin said.
    One miner was killed and 56 others were trapped underground
for about 24 hours before being brought safely out.

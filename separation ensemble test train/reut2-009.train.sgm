<TITLE>BALDRIGE SUPPORTS NIC TALKS ON CURRENCIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige
said he supported efforts to persuade newly-industrialized
countries (NICS) to revalue currencies that are tied to the
dollar in order to help the United States cut its massive trade
deficit.
    "We do need to do something with those currencies or we
will be substituting Japanese products for Taiwanese products,"
or those of other nations with currencies tied to the dollar,
Baldrige told a House banking subcommittee.
    The U.S. dollar has declined in value against the Yen and
European currencies, but has changed very little against the
currencies of some developing countries such as South Korea and
Taiwan because they are linked to the value of the dollar.
    As a result, efforts to reduce the value of the dollar over
the past year and a half have done little to improve the trade
deficits with those countries.
    Baldrige told a House Banking subcommittee that the
Treasury Department was attempting to persuade those countries
to reach agreement with the United States on exchange rates.

<TITLE>UNIONIST URGES RETALIATION AGAINST JAPAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>William Bywater, president of the
International Union of Electronic Workers, called on President
Reagan to retaliate against Japan for unfair practices in
semiconductor trade.
    He said in a statement a crash program was needed in the
semiconductor industry to prevent the United States from
becoming "one of the world's industrial lightweights."
    Bywater's remarks came as the White House Economic Policy
Council prepared for a Thursday meeting to decide what
sanctions if any should be taken against Japan for alleged 
violations of a U.S.-Japanese semiconductors agreement.
    The pact, agreed to last July, called for Tokyo to end
selling semiconductors at below cost and to open its home
market to U.S. goods. In return, Washington agreed to forego
antidumping duties on Japanese semiconductors.
    But U.S. officials have said that while Japan has stopped
dumping in the U.S. market, it has not ended third country
dumping; nor has it opened its market to U.S. semiconductors.
    Japan yesterday, in an effort to ward off U.S. action,
ordered a cutback in semiconductors production as a way to
force prices up and end the dumping.
    Bywater, in his statement, said he backed a Defense Science
Board task force proposal to set up a consortium to develop new
electronic products and manufacturing processes and make the
U.S. industory more competitive.
    But he added the industry could not wait for legislation to
pass and that action was required now to help the depressed
electronic industry.
    Bywater said, "I urge the Reagan Administration to take full
and severe action immediately against Japan by invoking the
retaliatory steps that are permitted under U.S. law and GATT
(General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade)."

<TITLE>DOLLAR EXPECTED TO FALL DESPITE INTERVENTION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Claire Miller, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Central bank intervention in the
foreign exchange markets succeeded in staunching the dollar's
losses today, but senior dealers here believe the U.S. currency
is headed for a further retreat.
    Although the intervention was widespread, dealers perceive
that the six major industrial nations have differing levels of
commitment to their recent accord to stabilize currencies.
    Moreover, hard economic realities hold greater sway over
the currency market than central bank intervention and these
argue for a further dollar decline, dealers said.
    "The market can be bigger than the central banks. And
economic fundamentals will always come to the fore," said a
dealer at one major U.S. bank.
    As the dollar dropped to post-World War II lows against the
yen today foreign exchange traders said the Bank of Japan,
Federal Reserve Board and Bank of England intervened in the
markets on behalf of the U.S. currency.
    Reports of the authorities' actions helped the dollar
recover to about 149.45 yen in New York this afternoon from
the post-war low of 148.20 yen in the Far East. But it still
failed to regain Monday's U.S. closing level of 150.00/05 yen.
    Tokyo dealers said the Bank of Japan bought one to 1.5
billion dlrs in Tokyo today and may also have purchased dollars
yesterday in the U.S. via the Federal Reserve.
    Meanwhile, there were strong rumors in New York that the
Fed also bought a modest amount of dollars around 148.50 yen
today. Talk also circulated that the Bank of England purchased
a small amount of dollars for yen.
    The Fed's last confirmed intervention was on January 28
when it bought 50 mln dlrs in coordination with the Bank of
Japan. But on March 11 the Fed also was rumored to have
signalled displeasure with a dollar surge above 1.87 marks.
    The authorities' actions appeared to back up the February
22 Paris pact between the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,
France and Canada under which the nations agreed to cooperate
to foster exchange rate stability around prevailing levels.
    But foreign exchange dealers were not overly impressed by
the authorities' intervention which they said can only soften
extreme moves in the market.
    For one thing, some dealers believed that the Fed's
purchases were done on behalf of the Bank of Japan rather than
for the U.S. central bank's own account, suggesting a rather  
watered-down American commitment to the currency accord.
    The Bank of England's action also was thought to be
completed on behalf of the Japanese central bank, reinforcing
the market's view that Japan is the most resolute of the six
nations in its support of the currency pact.
    "No-one doubts the Bank of Japan is serious. But the other
two central banks seem to be making more token gestures than
anything else," said Chris Bourdain of BankAmerica Corp.
    "I'm not convinced the intervention was concerted," said
Earl Johnson of Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. 
"It's a yen problem more than anything else."
    Some dealers said a rising wave of trade protectionist
sentiment in the U.S. limits the extent to which the American
authorities can endorse a stronger dollar against the yen.
    "The dollar's break below the key 150 yen level ties the
Treasury's hands behind its back. The U.S. cannot intervene on
its own account because of the strength of protectionism here,"
said Albert Soria of Swiss Bank Corp.
    Such comments reflect the view that the currency markets
are becoming increasingly politicized. Despite official
denials, some traders still feel the U.S. would countenance a
lower dollar to help trim the nation's trade deficit.
    The majority of the 170 billion dlr merchandise trade
deficit in 1986 was with Japan.
    Indeed U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker's comment on
Sunday that the February currency pact had not established
dollar targets was read by the market as a signal to sell the
U.S. currency and kicked off the latest retreat.
    "The dollar still has more room on the downside against the
yen based on the frictions in trade and financial services. The
currency market is becoming very political," said Natsuo Okada
of Sumitomo Bank Ltd.
    Okada expects the dollar to trade between 148 and 150 yen
this week but sees the chance of a drop to 140 yen by the end
of April or early May.
    Even if West Germany and Japan succeed in stimulating their
economies, it may not be enough to solve structural economic
imbalances in the near future, dealers said.
    "Even if Japan and West Germany do expand this year, it
won't be enough to help the trade situation much," said
Bourdain of BankAmerica, who also expects the dollar to drop to
148 yen in the next couple of days.

<TITLE>CHARTER CO &lt;QCHR> TO COMPLETE REORGANIZATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JACKSONVILLE, Fla., March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Charter Co, the huge
petrochemical concern in bankruptcy proceedings stemming from
hundreds of dioxin-related claims, said it and all of its
subsidiaries, except the Independent Petrochemical Corp, will
complete their reorganization on March 31.
    It said that on that date, it will deposit with an escrow
agent 288.8 mln dlrs in cash, 66.7 mln dlrs in notes and 31 mln
shares of its common for distribution.
    Company officials were not immediately available for
comment.
    As previously reported, Charter settled dioxin-related
claims for about 1,200 individuals and the state of Missouri,
resolving claims against it and all subsidiaries except
Independent Petrochemical.
    Charter said some of the settlements remain subject to
appeals and final court approvals and resolve claims against
charter and its subsidiaries except Independent Petrochemical.
    It said about 500 individual claims against it and certain
of its units remain pending as disputed claims in bankruptcy
court. It said about 300 of these claims have been filed since
confirmation of the joint plan of reorganization.
    Charter said its two creditors, an equity committee in its
bankruptcy proceedings and &lt;American Financial Corp>, which
will own 50.5 pct of its common after the reorganization, have
waived the requirement that Charter resolve all dioxin-related
claims against it prior to completing its reorganization.
    That requirement excludes claims against Independent
Petrochemical. Charter also said a plan for liquidation of
Independent has been approved by the bankruptcy court and will
be completed after March 31.
    Earlier, Charter reported net income for the year of 153.2
mln dlrs, which included a gain of 28.5 mln dlrs for
discontinued operations and 114.8 mln dlrs for the settlement
of claims in its reorganization proceedings.
    In 1985, it reported earnings of 1,274,000 dlrs, which
included a loss of 36.3 mln dlrs for discontinued operations
and 29.4 mln dlrs for extraordinary items.
    For the fourth quarter, it reported earnings of 118.8 mln
dlrs, including a gain of 28.6 mln dlrs for discontinued
operations and 90.5 mln dlrs mainly for claims settlements. In
the year-ago period, Charter reported a loss of 13 mln dlrs.

<DATELINE>    AKRON, Ohio, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>GenCorp Inc said it withdrew from
consideration at its annual meeting on March 31 proposals aimed
at providing for a stock split and an increased dividend so
that it could focus its energies on responding to the takeover
offer made last week by a partnership of AFG Industries Inc
&lt;AFG> and Wagner and Brown.
    In addition to proposing an increase in the number of its
outstanding common shares, GenCorp had suggested the adoption
of a classified or "staggered" board and the elimination of
cumulative voting.
    GenCorp said these proposals could "distract energy and
attention from the real task at hand -- to respond to the
tender offer in a manner which is in the best interests of the
company, its shareholders and its other constituencies."
    GenCorp said the proposal to increase its outstanding
shares was made with the aim of declaring a stock split and a
dividend increase.
    The other proposals, it said, would provide for greater
long-term stability and cohesiveness for the GenCorp board.
    The company did not indicate when it might resubmit the
proposals for approval by its shareholders.

<TITLE>RESORTS INT'L &lt;RT.A> RECEIVES TAKEOVER OFFER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ATLANTIC CITY, N.J., March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Resorts International Inc
said it received a proposal from &lt;KSZ Co Inc> under which
holders of Resorts class B stock would receive 140 dlrs a share
in cash and one share of common stock in a new company to be
formed through the takeover.
    Under the offer, Resorts said holders of its class A shares
would receive 15 dlrs a share in cash and three shares of
common stock in the new company.
    Resorts said the offer from KSZ calls for a merger of
Resorts with RI Acquisition Co Inc, a newly formed Delaware
corporation.
    Resorts said that prior to the merger, RI Acquisition would
be capitalized with about 100 mln dlrs of debt and about 220
mln dlrs of equity.
    It said 200 mln dlrs of the equity would be in the form of
special preferred stock.
    The KSZ offer, Resorts said, indicates that KSZ has a
commitment from &lt;M. Davies Cos> to buy all of the special
preferred stock.
    Resorts said the offer will expire at 1700 EST on March 27.
It said it asked its investment advisor, Bear, Stearns and Co,
to advise its board on the offer.
    Earlier this month, the estate of James M. Crosby and
certian members of his family agreed to sell their class B
shares to New York real estate tycoon Donald Trump for 135 dlrs
a share. The estate and family members hold 78 pct of the
752,297 class B shares outstanding.
    Trump also agreed to pay 135 dlrs a share for the remaining
class B shares outstanding.
    Resorts also has about 5,680,000 shares of outstanding
class A stock. These shares carry one one-hundredth the voting
power of the class B shares.
    Trump's offer beat out a rival bid of 135 dlrs a share made
by Pratt Hotel Corp &lt;PRAT>.
    Resorts said that under the proposal made by KSZ, existing
class A and class B shareholders would control about 96 pct of
the outstanding common of the new company formed to acquire
Resorts.
    Resorts said the new company, upon completion of the
merger, would hold the 220 mln dlrs of debt and that the
special preferred stock would immediately be converted into
exchangeable participating preferred of the new company.
    This preferred, Resorts said, would pay a dividend based on
the net cash flows from the new company's Paradise Island
operations.
    A Resorts spokesman said the KSZ offer was made in a
two-page letter and that Resorts could not comment on it
because it did not contain enough information. Resorts has
asked Bear, Sterns to obtain complete data, he said.
    The spokesman said Resorts is not familiar with KSZ but
that it believes the company is controlled by Marvin Davis, the
Denver oilman.
    Calls to Davis were referred to Lee Solters, who handles
public relations for Davis. Solters, said to be travelling, was
not immediately available for comment.
    Donald Trump was also unavailable for comment, as was a
spokesman for the Crosby estate.

<TITLE>CITICORP &lt;CCI> SEES DOUBLING IN RETAIL BANK NET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Citicorp expects net income in its
individual banking sector to top one billion dlrs by 1993,
compared with 462 mln dlrs in 1986, said Richard Braddock, head
of Citicorp's individual banking division.
    "We can double our earnings over the next five to seven
years," he told a banking analysts meeting, adding that this
forecast may be on the conservative side.
    He said that bank card operations and the New York branch
system would continue to turn in hefty profits but also picked
out other developing areas, such as U.S. mortgage and
international consumer, as major potential earners.
    Braddock and his sector heads made the following more
specific predictions:
    - Cost of funds and net credit loss levels in the U.S.
bankcard unit will taper off in coming years from 1986's
relatively inflated levels.
    - Customer net revenue in the mortgage banking area will
rise to 464.7 mln dlrs in 1987 from 374.3 mln in 1986.
    - The international consumer business will show 22 pct
compound annual growth in earnings between 1986 and 1992.
    - Private banking earnings will hit 100 mln dlrs in 1987
and top 200 mln dlrs in 1992.

Minister Renato Archer said Brazil will keep its computer
market closed to foreign goods in order to give its own infant
industry time to develop.
    "Every country establishes laws to protect its interests.
The United States closed their borders at a certain stage to
some foreign goods and therefore protected its industrial
development. Now it is time for Brazil to do likewise," Archer
said at the opening of a national software conference.
    After several meetings, Brazil and the U.S. Have made no
major progress in their computer row, which they have been

    The Reagan administration has objected to Brazil protecting

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>FED CHAIRMAN VOLCKER SAYS BANK PROPOSALS A WORRY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>The chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board, Paul Volcker, has written to the chairman of the House
Banking Committee to raise concerns about legislative proposals
scheduled for consideration Wednesday.
    Volcker told committee chairman Fernand St. Germain a
proposal to deny primary dealer status to firms from countries
that do not grant U.S. firms equal access to their government
debt markets might invite retaliation against U.S. firms
abroad.
    He added, "even Japan, against whom this proposal seems to
be particularly directed," has started opening its markets.
    In his letter, made available at the Treasury, Volcker also
said a proposal to ease debt problems of developing countries
by setting up a public facility to buy their debts owed to
commercial banks, was a problem.
    "I believe that the prospect of debt relief would undermine
the difficult internal efforts of the borrowing countries to
achieve the structural reform that is needed regardless of the
policies that are followed on servicing external debt," Volcker
said.
    It might also cause private lenders to become reluctant to
extend more credit to the borrowing countries, he said.
    Volcker said he endorsed comments by Treasury Secretary
James Baker "about the inappropriateness of using public
resources for purchasing private commercial bank debt, which we
both see as an inherent aspect of the proposed international
debt facility."
    He also said a proposal for establishing formal procedures
for international negotiations on currency exchange rates "is
unrealistic and could well have damaging effects."
    "For example, the bill's directive to intitiate negotiations
in order to achieve a competitive exchange rate for the dollar
-- a matter upon which there can be considerable difference
among analysts -- runs the risk of building up potentially
destabilizing market expectations," Volcker said.
    He recommended "we should not lock ourselves into formalized
procedures for international negotiations" on exchange rates but
instead use other, more flexible means like the recent mmeting
in Paris between U.S. treasury and central bank representatives
and those of major trade allies.

<TITLE>U.S. CORN ACREAGE SEEN NEAR RECORD LOW</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    by Maggie McNeil, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. corn acreage this year is 
likely to drop to the lowest level since the unsurpassed
acreage reductions of the 1983 PIK year and could rank as one
of the lowest corn plantings in the United States in sixty
years, Agriculture Department officials said.
    USDA releases its official plantings report on March 31.
Agriculture Department analysts said next week's figures will
likely show a sharp drop in acreage to as low as 65 mln acres,
down 22 pct from last year's plantings of 83.3 mln acres.
    Assuming an 18 mln acre drop in plantings, U.S. corn
production will also decrease significantly. Analysts said 1987
corn production could drop by over one billion bushels to
around seven billion bushels.
    Expected signup of up to 90 pct in the 1987 feed grains
program, along with 1.9 mln acres enrolled in the conservation
program, will cause acreage to plummet, Department feedgrain
analysts said.
    "There's no question that there will be a sharp decrease in
corn acreage," one said. "It's difficult for any farmer to not
go along with the program this year."
    Soybean acreage is also expected to decline this year but
at a much slower rate of around four pct, USDA analysts said.
    Soybean plantings could drop to 59 mln acres or below, they
said, compared to last year's level of 61.5 mln acres.
    If analysts' unofficial estimates prove correct then the
drop in u.s. corn acreage will be the largest since 1983 when
farmers idled 22 mln acres in the Payment-In-Kind program.
    Farmers planted only around 60 mln acres of corn in 1983. A
severe drought that summer in major producing states caused
yields to tumble and final crop production to total only 4.2
billion bushels.
    Given normal weather conditions this year, USDA analysts
said the 1987 corn crop could end up around seven billion
bushels, down from last year's crop of 8.3 billion bushels.
    "This kind of acreage reduction will mean a significant
reduction in production," an analyst said.
    A crop of seven billion bushels is close to the annual U.S.
corn usage, so surplus stocks, while not decreasing, would not
increase significantly, a specialist said.
    High producing corn belt states are expected to show the
greatest acreage reductions, based upon historical
participation in government programs, analysts said.
    In contrast, soybean acreage is likely to be cut the most
in marginal producing areas of the southeast and the western
corn belt, a USDA soybean analyst said.
    "Soybean acreage in the eastern corn belt will not budge,"
he said. Neither does he expect any significant acreage cuts in
higher-producing delta areas.
    Soybean production could drop fractionally from last year's
2.0 billion bushels to 1.8 to 1.9 billion, he said.
    U.S. soybean acreage, after soaring to 71.4 mln acres in
1979 from only 52 mln acres five years prior to that, has
steadily declined in the 1980's.
    U.S. corn acreage, with the exception of 1983, has been in
the low to mid 80-mln acre range for the past 10 years. The
highest corn plantings reported in the 60 years that USDA has
kept such records was in 1932 when farmers planted 113 mln
acres and obtained average yields of 26.5 bushels per acre.
    Last year U.S. farmers obtained record corn yields
averaging 119.3 bushels per acre.
    "We have absolutely no trouble producing an eight billion
bushel crop on only 80 mln acres or so," an analyst said.
    Corn acreage will probably level at around 65 mln acres as
long as government program provisions remain the same, analysts
said.
    Currently farmers enrolling in the program are required to
set aside 20 pct of their base acreage and then are eligible
for payments of two dlrs per bushel by idling an additional 15
pct of their acreage.
    "To get to the PIK level of 60 mln acres, we would have to
provide more incentives," an analyst said.

<TITLE>U.S. SENATORS SEEK TO EXPAND USDA EXPORT BONUS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Leading U.S. farm state senators are
seeking to insert into the Senate's omnibus trade bill a
provision that would broaden eligibility requirements under the
U.S. Agriculture Department's export enhancement program, EEP,
to include traditional buyers of U.S. farm products, including
the Soviet Union, Senate staff said.
    Under existing criteria, USDA can offer EEP subsidies to
recoup export markets lost to competing nations' unfair trading
practices.
    Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.)
is leading a group of farm state senators in an effort to
broaden the criteria in such a way as to enable Moscow to be
eligible for the subsidies, sources said.
    The senators -- including Senate Finance Committee Chairman
Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), Max Baucus (D-Mont.), David Pryor
(D-Ark.), John Melcher (D-Mont.) and Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) --
also may fold into the trade bill a measure to shield pork
producers and processors from Canadian imports.
    The measure, sponsored by Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa),
would clarify the definition of "industry" in determining whether
or not imports were causing injury to U.S. producers.
    Grassley's bill stems from a 1985 decision by the
International Trade Commission that imports from Canada of live
swine -- but not fresh, chilled and frozen pork -- were harming
U.S. producers.
    The bill's proponents have argued Canada has simply
replaced shipments of live hogs with fresh pork.

<TITLE>FED'S JOHNSON SAYS FED ACTED TO STABILIZE DOLLAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman
Manuel Johnson said the dollar has stabilized against other
currencies after action taken by the Fed.
    "We have taken the appropriate action and the dollar has
stabilized," Johnson said after testifying to a House Banking
subcommittee.
    He did not elaborate on the nature of the action nor when
it was taken, but said that it was in the spirit of the
agreement reached by six industrial nations in Paris recently.
    Johnson said the dollar's decline against other currencies
such as the Japanese yen has been gradual.
    Since the accord by the United States, Britain, West
Germany, Japan, France and Canada, foreign exchange markets
have been closely watching for indications of intervention by
central banks to determine the committment by those nations to
their agreement.
    The nations agreed that currency exchange rates were at
about the correct levels when the pact was signed earlier this
year.

<TITLE>VENEZUELA TO ANNOUCE PARTNER FOR COAL VENTURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CARACAS, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Petroleos de Venezuela S.A will
announce within two weeks the name of a foreign consortium it
has chosen to help exploit the coal deposits at Guasare in
western Zulia state, PDVSA president Juan Chacin Guzman said.
    Chacin told reporters the foreign partner will provide
capital as well as technical and marketing expertise to the
Carbozulia project, which the state oil company will manage.
    PDVSA officials said that among those who bid for the
partnership is a consortium between Agip Carbone, a subsidiary
of Italy's Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi (ENI), and Atlantic
Richfield &lt;ARC> of the United States.
    Minister of Energy and Mines Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said
discussions are currently taking place to finalize the terms of
the contract with the foreign partner.
    PDVSA vice-president Pablo Reimpell said last week the
first shipment of coal from the Carbozulia project should be
made during the final quarter of 1987, and would measure
between 100-150,000 metric tons.
    Plans call for production to eventually reach 500,000 mt
annually. Reimpell said the original investment in the project
will be approximately 8 billion bolivars.

<TITLE>U.S. SUGAR QUOTA MAY BE EASED, CONGRESSMAN SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, MARCH 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States may soon ease its
1987 sugar import quota of one mln short tons by bringing
forward to the third quarter some shipments scheduled for the
fourth quarter of 1987, Jerry Huckaby, a leading Congressman
representing sugar growers told Reuters in an interview.
    Huckaby, a Louisiana Democrat and chairman of the House
subcommittee which deals with the sugar program, indicated the
easing of the quota might be a way to calm the concern about
the impact of the severe cut in U.S. sugar imports this year.
    "With imports coming down from 1.8 mln (last year) to one
mln, there is legitimate concern about the impacts on Caribbean
countries and the Philippines," Huckaby said.
    By bringing forward to the third quarter some imports, the
quota would effectively be eased by about 250,000 tons.
    Huckaby said by simply bringing forward to the third
quarter of the year sugar imports scheduled for the September
to December period "we could get away without having to
increase the quota."
    He noted that some in the sugar industry believe an
increase in the quota is justified.
    Earlier this month, representatives of U.S. cane sugar
refiners met with U.S. Agriculture Department officials to
request a quota increase of at least 200,000 tons. The refiners
said the increase is needed because the quota is so restrictive
there could be some spot shortages of sugar in the U.S later
this year, a refiner spokesman said.
    However, the official slaid the USDA replied only that it
would consider the request.
    Following the refiners' request, representatives of the
Florida sugarcane producers met with USDA to express opposition
to any quota expansion, industry sources said.
    The statement by Huckaby, who as a representative from a
sugar growing district in Louisiana is a leading architect of
the current sugar program, indicates at least some grower
officials are concerned enough to support an easing of the
import quota, industry officials said.
    Any final decision on easing the quota must be made by the
Reagan administration's interagency sugar policy group.
    Asked about possible quota changes, A USDA official said
"As far as I know, changing the quota volume or the quota year
is not under active consideration."

<DATELINE>    SUNNYVALE, Calif., March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>California Microwave Inc said
it will take non-recurring charges of 9.7 mln dlrs to pre-tax
earnings in the third quarter ended March 31.
    The company said earnings from operations in the second
half, ending June 30, 1987, excluding the charges, are expected
to be in the break-even range.
    In the second half of 1986 net earnings were 2,297,000
dlrs, or 29 cts per share.
    The company said the charges relate to its
telecommunications products area and three other areas.
    California Microwave previously estimated the write-downs
in the six to eight-mln-dlr range. It said it will add to that
a reserve for investment losses in Argo Communications Corp.
    Also to be included in the write-down are charges against
its advances to an Arizona-based communications electronics
firm the company has an option to acquire, it said.
    In addition, accruals are being made for costs associated
with the company's reduction in its Sunnyvale work force.
    California Microwave said the write-downs should have a
nominal cash impact, as the company already has paid for the
assets being written down.

<TITLE>BORG-WARNER &lt;BOR> TELLS OF TALKS WITH JACOBS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Borg-Warner Corp said it has had
discussions with Irwin Jacobs on his interest in the
possibility of Minstar Inc &lt;MNST>, a Jacobs controlled company,
being given access to certain non-public information about
Borg-Warner.
    In late February, an investor group headed by Jacobs
offered 44 dlrs a share, or 3.29 billion dlrs, to take over
Borg-Warner.
    Borg-Warner said it advised Jacobs that before its board
would give Minstar access to company records Minstar would have
to provide satisfactory evidence that sufficient financing was
committed to carry out whatever transaction was proposed.
    A Borg-Warner spokesperson said the discussions with Jacobs
and other Minstar officials focused on terms and conditions
under which the company would consider granting Minstar access
to the information it was seeking.
    The Borg-Warner spokesperson said the company has not been
able to reach an agreement with Minstar, and Borg-Warner has

<TITLE>CANADA VOWS TO FIGHT U.S. POTASH ACTION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Russell Blinch, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>External Affairs Minister Joe Clark
today vowed to do everything possible to fight the U.S. action
against Canadian potash exports, but also warned against
raising the alarm too early in the dispute.
    In the latest flashpoint in Canadian-U.S. trade relations,
the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled unanimously
Monday that Canadian potash shipments valued at 270 million
U.S. dlrs last year were injuring the U.S. industry.
    "We certainly intend to do everything we can to insure that
Canadian interests are well protected," Clark told the House of
Commons in the daily question period.
    But he said the opposition parties should be careful "not
to raise false alarms too early."
    The case now goes before the U.S. Commerce Department's
trade division to determine if a duty should be imposed. Potash
producers from New Mexico, claiming unfair government
subsidies, are seeking a 43 pct tariff on Canada's shipments.
    Canada, the world's largest potash producer, exported 9.8
mln metric tonnes of potash last year, with nearly a third
going to the U.S.
    Most of the potash, used in the production of fertilizer,
comes from provincially owned mines in Saskatchewan.
    In the Commons, Liberal member Lloyd Axworthy branded the
ruling as just another "trade harrassment" from the U.S. and
criticized Clark's assurances the country's interests would be
protected.
    "We received exactly the same kind of assurances in the
softwood lumber case that was totally fumbled and bumbled,"
Axworthy said.
    Canada's Progressive Conservative government agreed to
impose a 15 pct duty on its softwood lumber exports earlier
this year to end a long and bitter bilateral trade dispute with
the U.S.
    Axworthy urged the government to present Canada's case to
world trade authorities under the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade.
    But Clark maintained the potash dispute was another example
of why Canada needs to find a new way to settle bilateral
irritants in the free trade negotiations under way with the
U.S.
    "What we are seeking to do is put in place a better
system," Clark said.
    Meanwhile, Saskatchewan Trade Minister Bob Andrew expressed
confidence Canada would win its case, claiming the problem
stems from low international commodity prices and not
government subsidies.
    "The reality of the problem and the injury is caused
worldwide," he said. "It's caused by a downturn in the
commodity price for fertilizer, whether it's potash fertilizer,
nitrogen fertilizer or whatever."

<DATELINE>    PORT OF SPAIN, TRINIDAD, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Trinidad and Tobago is
finalizing arrangements with Union Carbide &lt;UK> of the United
States and Snamprogetti of Italy for the construction of a
1,500 tonnes per day methanol plant, Energy Minister Kelvin
Ramnath said.
    Ramnath said the ministry is now holding talks with Union
Carbide on the price of natural gas to be used in the plant,
which will be constructed near the Trinidad and Tobago oil
company (Trintoc) refinery at Point Fortin on the west coast.
    Snamprogetti built the first methanol refinery on trinidad
five years ago.
    Trintoc is likely to put up land, refinery plant and
machinery as equity. If negotiations go smoothly, ramnath said,
construction could begin by next january.
    The government of prime minister A.N.R. Robinson is hoping
to lue new investors to the twin-island state's petrochemical
industry, in order to make use of new findings of natural gas.

<TITLE>GENCORP &lt;GY> TAKEOVER GROUP CANCELS HEARING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>The investor group seeking to acquire
GenCorp Inc said it agreed to cancel a court hearing after
GenCorp withdrew three proposals that, if approved, would have
made it more costly and difficult to acquire the Akron,
Ohio-based company.
    Earlier today GenCorp said it will not ask shareholders to
approve an increase in the number of its outstanding shares,
the election of a staggered board of directors and the
elimination of cumulative voting.
    However, the group said it will continue to try to block
GenCorp's poison-pill provision.
    The group, a partnership of AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG> and
&lt;Wagner and Brown>, was to go to court on March 27 to block
GenCorp for having the three proposals voted on by shareholders
at its annual meeting.
    GenCorp said it withdrew the proposals so that it could
focus its attention on the takeover offer.
    The takeover partnership said it has asked to meet with
GenCorp to negotiate a repeal of the company's poison pill
plan.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>MERGERS, PUBLIC OFFERS SEEN AMONG CAR DEALERS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Scott Williams, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    Detroit, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Automobile dealerships have become
large, multi-store operations, and the largest sell more than 1
billion dlrs a year worth of vehicles a year.
    Around the auto industry there is talk of mergers and
buyouts among dealerships, and there are rumors that the
largest are considering offering shares to the public, analysts
say.
    Retail car sales "are at a point of transition. There's not
much that's off the table in terms of creative thinking" about
ways to sell cars, says David Cole, analyst with the University
of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute.
    The retail car market is "much more freeform now" than it
was in 1956, the year things began to change, says Detroit
analyst Arvid Jauppi of Arvid Jauppi and Associates.
    Thirty years ago, in 1956, the situation was different.
Dealerships sold one kind of car--a "Chevy" or a Ford or a
Studebaker. The average dealer had 17 employees and sold
738,000 dlrs worth of vehicles, according to the National
Automobile Dealers Association.
    That year a tiny car from overseas--Germany's Volkswagen
Beatle--began to gain popularity. The "Bug" caused "a
rebellion" among dealers, who demanded greater freedom from
restrictions placed on them by the major American automakers,
says Jauppi.
    One of the most visible changes in retail car sales has
been in the size of dealerships, auto analysts say. Last year,
the average dealership had 11.2 mln dlrs in sales--a 15-fold
increase from 1956--and employed 34 workers.
    "I had one of these guys tell me he makes six, seven mln
dlrs a year and didn't know what to do with all his money,"
says Cole.
    "There's a whole lot more rich guys who sell cars than that
make cars," he says.
    With the increase in size, large dealers have been buying
up other dealerships, and auto analysts see few signs the trend
will let up.
    Donald Keithley, vice president, dealer services, for J.D.
Power, a California-based market research firm, says that, by
1990, 12,000 people will own dealerships compared to 16,800
principal owners today.
    Many dealers are experimenting with owning several
franchises, some of which might compete against each other. "It
used to be a Chevrolet dealer was a Chevrolet dealer. Now a
Chevrolet dealer might handle several lines," Jauppi says.
    As dealers get bigger, industry officials are talking about
the possibility that some of them might become publicly-owned
or open international operations.
    Offering shares to the public is an option large dealers,
"are obviously thinking of very seriously," says Cole.
    Although some say the franchise system might get in the way
of a public offering, Jauppi says there are few obstacles to
trading in car dealer shares.
    "Dealers are large enough now to go public. The only thing
the manufacturer cares about is that the dealer sells those
cars. It could happen any time," Jauppi says.
    "If you look at the whole merger mania, and look at the
scale some of these dealers, it's going to be very hard to
resist taking them public," said another analyst.
    And Jauppi says that dealerships can be expected to become
international.
    "We're going to have international dealers--dealer networks
that are worldwide," he says. U.S. dealers will be attracted
particularly to Europe, where the market will expand faster
than the U.S., he says.
    "It's not totally off the wall," says Cole.

<TITLE>CHAPMAN &lt;CHPN> IN RESTRUCTURING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DALLAS, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chapman Energy INc said it is launching
a major restructuring which, if not approved, it will have no
alternative but to seek protection under Chapter 11.
    Under the plan, Chapman will exchange securities and cash
for all outstanding 12 pct senior subordinated debentures due
2000 and will sell a controlling interest to Troon Partners
Ltd.
   The agreement with Troon requires Troon to advance 6.5 mln
dlrs partially secured by a first mortgage lien on the
company's interest in its natural gas pipeline partnership and
Troon to tender 100,000 principal amount of debentures to
Chapman.
    Proceeds of the loan will be used for the cash portion of
the restructuring. Troon will acquire a majority stock interest
and control of the board.
    In addition, Chapman and Troon will establish a 10 mln dlrs
acquisition joint ventures, it said.
    The plan also contemplates establishing a restructured loan
providing for one master credit agreement having an aggregate
balance of 22.4 mln dlrs.
    The plan also contemplates the recapitalization of
preferred stock whereby each share will be converted into three
shares of common stock.
    Chapman also said it also plans to negotiate settelment and
discharge of a substantial portion of its accounts payable and
settlement of certain litigation.
    If approved by various creditors and shareholders, the
company expects the plan to be completed by May 29.
    Chapman also repoted a loss of 43.4 mln dlrs for the year,
including asset writedowns of 35.5 mln dlrs, compared to
December 31, compared to a net income of 177,243 in 1985.
    The 1986 loss resulted in shareholders' deficiency of 15
mln dlrs compared to shareholder's equity of 28.9 mln last
year.
    Total assets decreased to 35.6 mln dlrs from 81.8 mln dlrs.

when the dollar was at about 149.60 yen, and helped drive the
U.S. Currency up to around 150, he said.
    Another said the central bank seemed to be trying to push
the dollar up above 150 yen. But heavy selling at around that
level quickly pushed the dollar back down towards 149 yen,
dealers said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>BRAZIL/BANK COMMITTEE AGREE ON CREDIT REQUEST</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MIAMI, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil and its bank advisory committee
agreed to transmit a request for an extension of short-term
credit lines totalling 16 billion dlrs for 60 days until May
31, Brazilian Central Bank President Francisco Gros said.
    Speaking after talks with the committee here, Gros also
said he did not expect to make interest payment to the banks at
this moment.
    He added that "no one should expect any dramatic
developments before March 31."
    Brazil last month suspended interest payments on its 68
billion dlrs debt to commercial banks and froze short-term
trade and money market lines.
    Bankers said they would relay the Brazilian request for an
extension but declined to say whether they were specifically
endorsing it.
    Gros said the decision, which he called a "standstill"
arrangement, will be communicated to Brazil's 700 bank
creditors by telex tomorrow. Banks had been pressing Brazil to
make at least a token interest payment, but Gros said the
government was unable to comply for the moment.
    He stressed however that Brazil was willing to pay as soon
as it could, but added that a payment of interest was not
connected with the extension of the credit lines.
    "That would not be wise," he said.
    He said that the extension of the short-term lines would
not be carried out through "an official instrument" as there was
not time to complete the legal requirements.
    Gros said Brazil was likely to meet again with the 14-bank
advisory committee once Brazil had information to present on an
economic plan.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>An Agriculture Ministry survey has
estimated the nation's 1986/87 crop sugar cane output at 2.14
mln tonnes, down from 2.62 mln a year earlier.
    Ministry officials said the decline was due to bad weather
and a reduction in the land under sugar cane this season, which
totals 34,800 hectares, down from 35,700 in 1985/86, they said.
    Harvesting stretches from December 1986 to April 1987
    Japan's final output will be announced at the beginning of
June, they said.

<DATELINE>    PERTH, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bell Group Ltd &lt;BLLA.S> said it will
make two convertible bond issues totalling 200 mln dlrs.
    An issue of about 125 mln in convertible bonds, to be
quoted on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, would be offered in
Europe through a syndicate led by &lt;Banque Paribas Capital
Markets Ltd>, &lt;Swiss Bank Corp International Ltd> and &lt;S.G.
Warburg Securities>, Bell Group said in a statement.
    Subject to shareholder approval, at a meeting on April 22,
a further 75 mln dlrs in convertible bonds would be subscribed
by Bell Group chairman Robert Holmes a Court, it said.
    The funds would provide additional working capital.
    The bonds, maturing 10 years from the date of issue, would
carry a 10 pct per annum interest rate, payable annually in
arrears, Bell Group said.
    The bonds are convertible into ordinary shares of The Bell
Group Ltd at any time, with the issue price a premium in the
range of 20 to 25 pct above the market price of the ordinary
shares at the date of issue of the bonds, it said.
    The bonds also carry the right for the issuer to redeem
them after two years if the share price is above 130 pct of the
conversion price for more than 30 days. Bell Group made a
similar 75 mln dlr bond issue in December 1985.

<TITLE>EXCHANGE RATES ALMOST WITHIN G-6 LEVELS - SUMITA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita
said that current exchange rates are almost within the levels
agreed to by six major nations last month in Paris.
    Asked whether a dollar/yen rate of 148 or 149 reflected
economic fundamentals, he said current rates almost reflect
fundamentals.
    Sumita told reporters major nations have cooperated to
bring about currency stability in line with the Paris
agreement, which stipulated that they would closely cooperate
to that end. He repeated the central bank will intervene if
necessary, adding he did not think a dollar free-fall was
likely.
    But Sumita said he could not say exactly what currency
levels would be considered in line with underlying economic
fundamentals.
    In Paris on February 22, Britain, Canada, France, Japan,
the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate to hold
currencies around their then current levels.
    Sumita said he could not find any specific reasons behind
the fall of the dollar to a record low against the yen
yesterday. But he said the market rushed to sell dollars as it
nervously reacted to statements abroad and to developments
surrounding trade tensions.
    U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said over the weekend
that the Paris pact did not encompass fixed tragets for the
dollar. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter called
U.S/Japan relations on certain key trade issues very strained.
    The market reacted nervously because the dollar has been
moving narrowly against the yen since mid-January, Sumita said.
He added he does not expect the yen/dollar exchange rate to
remain unstable because the market is concerned about a sharp
rise of the yen.
    The Bank of Japan will keep a close watch on exchange rates
in line with the Paris accord, he added.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita
said the central bank has no intention of cutting its discount
rate again as a way of preventing the yen's rise.
    He told a press conference that the growth of Japanese
money supply remains high.
    The bank will have to watch closely various developments
resulting from its already eased monetary stance, such as the
sharp rise in real estate and stock prices, he said.
    Although the yen's rise will have a greater deflationary
impact on the economy, the economy is not likely to slow down
much further, Sumita said.
    "I don't think we should change our economic outlook at the
moment," Sumita said.
    Sumita has said in the past that he expects the economy to
show a gradual upturn in the second half of the year.
    The governor said the six major industrial nations are
expected to review last month's pact on currency stability when
they meet next in April.
    Dealers said they expect the six - Britain, Canada, France,
Japan, the U.S. Amd West Germany - to meet just before the
IMF/World Bank interim committee meeting in Washington starting
on April 9.

<TITLE>JARDINE MATHESON PROFITS SEEN UP SHARPLY IN 1986</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Joshua So, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>A strong performance by its retail
businesses and affiliates will enable Jardine Matheson Holdings
Ltd &lt;JARD.HKG> to report on Friday a big leap in net profit in
1986, stock analysts said.
    They told Reuters they expect the firm to show earnings of
between 420 mln and 450 mln H.K. Dlrs last year against 157 mln
in 1985.
    The analysts also said they expect Jardine Matheson to pay
a total dividend of 15 to 20 cents a share against 10 cents a
share in 1985.
    James Capel (Far East) Ltd estimates Jardine Matheson's
1986 profits at 450 mln dlrs and attributes most of the income
to retail sales.
    Analysts said the group's 7-Eleven retail stores and its
franchises, among them Canon cameras, Christian Dior luxury
goods and Mercedes Benz cars, produced a strong cash flow.
    Alan Hargreaves of Hoare Govett Asia Ltd also put Jardine
Matheson's 1986 net profits at 450 mln dlrs and said he
estimates pre-tax earnings from retail operations at about 465
mln dlrs against 339 mln in 1985.
    But Hargreaves said Jardine Matheson's earnings from its 35
pct stake in Hong Kong Land Co Ltd &lt;HKLD.HKG> will fall to
about 230 mln dlrs from 281 mln dlrs in 1985.
    The reduced contribution reflects the spin-off from Hong
Kong Land of &lt;Dairy Farm International Ltd> last September.
    Jardine gained a direct holding of 35 pct of Dairy Farm as
a result of the spin-off. Analysts said Jardine will book
revenues from its Dairy Farm stake for the final months of the
year as part of its retail business, which will increase its
overall retail income figures.
    Analysts said Jardine Matheson will also enjoy sharply
increased revenues from financial services, mainly its 50 pct
share of &lt;Jardine Fleming Holdings Ltd>.
    Jardine Fleming yesterday reported record profits for 1986
of 209.5 mln dlrs against 104.7 mln in 1985.
    Analysts said Jardine Matheson made net interest payments
of about 200 mln dlrs last year, slightly below the 213 mln
dlrs of 1985, while the company's term debt remained at about
the 1985 level of 2.7 billion dlrs.
    But Jardine was also subject to increased taxes of 340 mln
dlrs last year against 292 mln in 1985, they said.
    Jardine Matheson is undergoing a series of reorganisations
that will in effect turn it into a holding company for its
diverse interests.
    It previously announced a plan to sell its stakes in both
Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm to newly created &lt;Jardine
Strategic Holdings Ltd> in which it has a 41 pct interest.
    A company statement issued last month said the firm will
use the proceeds to repay all debt, leaving it with an
additional 500 mln dlrs in cash on hand.
    Though Jardine Matheson will be deprived of a direct stake
in the high-yield Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm units, it is
likely to develop its own business, analysts said.
    "The future of the stock will depend on the firm's ability
to creatively structure some new acquisitions," said Hargreaves
of Hoare Govett.
    He noted the firm has suggested financial services as a key
sector, and he said it may add some insurance firms to its
existing business.

<TITLE>FOREIGN BROKERS GET MORE ACCESS TO JAPANESE BONDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Finance Ministry has accepted a
decision by the securities industry to expand the share of
foreign brokers in the 10-year bond underwriting syndicate to
5.73 pct from 1.19 pct now, a ministry spokesman said.
    Earlier this month, the ministry approved a plan to expand
the securities industry's share in the syndicate to 26.2 pct
from 26 pct from April to allow six foreign securities firms to
participate, he said.
    The banks' share in the syndicate will be cut to 73.8 pct
from 74 pct from April.
    Each of the original 17 foreign brokers had a 0.07 pct
share, but the securities industry said in a report accepted by
the ministry that it decided to raise the share of some foreign
firms due to their commitment to the Japanese market.
    Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd will have one pct, while S.G.
Warburg and Co Ltd, Goldman, Sachs International Corp, Jardine
Fleming (Securities) Ltd, First Boston Corp, Merrill Lynch
Securities Co and Morgan Stanley and Co Inc will each have 0.5
pct.
    Vickers da Costa Ltd and Smith Barney, Harris Upham
International Inc will each have 0.3 pct. Kleinwort, Benson
Ltd, Kidder, Peabody and Co Ltd, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc,
Deutsche Bank AG and W.I. Carr, Sons and Co each get 0.1 pct.
    Bache Securities (Japan) Ltd, Hoare Govett (Far East) Ltd
and J. Henry Schroeder Bank and Trust Co and the six new
syndicate members -- E.F. Hutton International Inc, Shearson
Lehman Brothers Asia Inc, Dresdner Bank AG, Swiss Bank Corp
International Asia Inc, Sogen Security Corp and Swiss Union
Philips and Drew Ltd -- will each have a 0.07 pct share in the
securities industry.

<TITLE>CHINA'S FIRST JOINT VENTURE BANK REPORTS PROFIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>China's first joint venture bank, Xiamen
International Bank (XIB), reported a group net profit of about
14 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986, the bank's first full year of
operation.
    General manager Liu Shuxun declined to give a 1987 profit
forecast, saying targets were under study.
    Assistant general manager Wang Hongshan said the group's
outstanding loans at end-1986 totalled 620 mln Hong Kong dlrs,
up from 530 mln at end-1985. Deposits and interbank borrowings
rose to 680 mln dlrs from 550 mln, he told Reuters.
    Liu said most of the group's profit came from the parent
company rather than its two wholly-owned subsidiaries &lt;Xiamen
International Finance Co Ltd> in Hong Kong and &lt;Luso
International Bank Ltd> in Macao.
    The joint venture bank began operating in September 1985
but did not officially open until March 1986.
    Liu said the share in the joint venture of the foreign
partner, Hong Kong-listed &lt;Panin Holdings Ltd>, had been cut
last year to 49 pct from 60 pct. This was done because foreign
banks felt the XIB's reputation would be improved if the three
Chinese partners collectively held a majority stake, he said.
    Liu said news reports about problems concerning Panin were
unfounded, but he did not elaborate. Panin Holdings reported a
loss of 1.99 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986 after a net profit of
268,000 dlrs in 1985.
    The Chinese partners are Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China, Fujian branch, whose share rose to 23.5 pct from 15,
Fujian Investment and Enterprise Corporation 17.5 pct (15) and
Xiamen Construction and Development Corporation 10 pct (10).
    One foreign banker said Xiamen International Bank faced the
same problems as foreign bank branches in trying to compete on
unequal terms with state-owned banks.
    The foreign banking market in Xiamen is thin and almost
saturated, he added.
    Officials of the joint venture bank said they benefitted
from contacts made through its three Chinese partners. But the
foreign banker, who asked not to be named, said it faced
internal competition from the Industrial and Commercial Bank.
    Apart from Xiamen International Bank and the International
Agricultural Development Bank planned by the World Bank and the
state-owned Agricultural Bank of China, Xiamen has eight
foreign bank branches or representative offices, mostly of Hong
Kong or overseas Chinese banks.

<TITLE>YEN MAY RISE TO 140 TO THE DOLLAR, NIKKEIREN SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>The yen could rise to 140 yen to the
dollar, a leading Japanese businessman said.
    Bumpei Otsuki, president of the influential Japan
Federation of Employers' Associations, (Nikkeiren), told
reporters: "The yen might rise as far as 140 (to the dollar).
The U.S. Economy is not good, and as long as the U.S. Economy
is not good, the U.S. Will put various pressures (on Japan)."
    "The yen's level depends on the condition of the U.S.
Economy rather than Japan's economy, and as long as the
American situation is bad, the yen will continue to rise," he
said.
    To cope with the negative impact of the strong yen,
Japanese enterprises must strive to cut costs by all means,
including holding down wages as much as possible, Otsuki said.
    He rejected recent calls from some government quarters for
wage increases this year as a means of raising private
consumption and thus boosting domestic demand.
    "We have to keep wages as low as possible," he said.
    He also said the yen's large and rapid rise is depressing
the outlook for the Japanese economy, noting that in addition
to hurting exporters it is also damaging domestic market
manufacturers through cheap imports.
    Parts of the service sector are also threatened, Otsuki
said.
    Tertiary industries provide services to manufacturers and a
downturn in manufacturing profits will adversely affect service
industries, he said.
    It is also doubtful whether the tertiary sector can fully
employ those put out of work in the manufacturing sector, he
said.
    Profits of service sector companies are likely to fall in
the business year ending in March 1988, leading to a possible
recession in the Japanese economy, he said.
    Otsuki said economic growth is unlikely to pick up beyond
levels experienced in 1986.
    The government's Economic Planning Agency said last week
the economy grew at 2.5 pct in 1986, the worst performance
since 1974 when the economy shrank 1.4 pct due to the first oil
price crisis.
    In order to stimulate domestic demand and boost the
economy, tax reforms aimed at bringing down the cost of land
and reforming the nation's housing stock are needed, along with
steps to bring down the high cost of commodities, he said.

state farms known as new economic zones in 1987, to create jobs
and grow more high-value export crops, the communist party
newspaper Nhan Dan said.
    Yesterday's edition, received here today, said Vietnam
would invest one billion dong, including the costs of
relocation, in 272 new economic zones. About one third of that
sum would be spent on export crops such as coffee, tea, rubber
and pepper in the Central Highlands, it said.
    Since 1975, Vietnam has resettled about three million
people from cities and crowded river deltas to the zones.

<TITLE>MADAGASCAR EXTENDS AMOCO OIL EXPLORATION AGREEMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ANTANANARIVO, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Madagascar extended its oil
exploration agreement with the U.S. Firm Amoco Corp &lt;AN> for 17
months to allow for further studies of the Morondava basin on
the southwest coast, a government statement said.
    It said the existing five-year agreement, due to expire
this July 24, was extended until the end of 1988 to allow for
additional geological and geophysical studies.
    Amoco has so far laid 7,100 km of seismic lines and sunk
five exploration wells in the Morondava basin. It may drill a
further three wells before the end of the extended exploration
period, the statement said.
    Madagascar has signed oil exploration agreements with four
foreign oil companies since 1981. But despite promising
indications of large reserves, no commercial production plans
have yet been announced.
    The foreign firms - Amoco, Occidental Petroleum Corp &lt;OXY>,
Mobil Corp &lt;MOB> and a unit of &lt;Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi> -
are working in partnership with the National Military Office
for Strategic Industries (OMNIS).
    Roland Ratsimandresy, the director general of OMNIS, said
at a ceremenony to sign the extension of the Amoco agreement
that his department would intensify oil exploration with its
existing partners and would soon offer a new round of
exploration licences.

<TITLE>FERRUZZI DEAL WITH CPC WORTH 630 MLN DLRS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Ferruzzi Group's holding company
Agricola Finanziara SpA will pay 630 mln dlrs for the European
corn wet milling business of CPC International Inc under the
agreement reached in principle between the two companies, a
statement by Ferruzzi released by its Brussels office said.
    When CPC announced the agreement yesterday in New York, it
said only that the price would be in excess of 600 mln dlrs.
    Ferruzzi said the deal is subject to agreement on several
clauses of the contract and needs government authorisations.
    It said the deal would involve 13 starch factories
employing about 5,000 people in eight European Community
countries plus facilities and commercial operations in other EC
states.
    The factories have a capacity to produce the equivalent of
1.6 mln tonnes of starch in starch and by-products a year, or
about one third of EC production, from about 2.7 mln tonnes of
cereals.
    Ferruzzi said the acquisition of these assets would extend
its presence in the European agro-industrial industry both
geographically and in terms of products.
    It said it is already the principal EC producer of sugar
and of soya oil and cake, and the major cereal trader.
    It noted that EC output of isoglucose is subject to maximum
quotas, of which CPC currently holds a 25 pct share, and said
it foresaw an increase in other industrial uses of starch in
the future, notably in the production of ethanol for fuel.
    Raul Gardini, president of the Ferruzzi Group, said the
present management of the CPC milling business will be asked to
remain in their posts.

<TITLE>SRI LANKAN GOVERNMENT TO STOP IMPORTING SUGAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    COLOMBO, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Food Department will no longer
import sugar from April 1, senior officials of the Food and
Cooperatives Ministry and the Department told Reuters.
    They said the decision was taken after the Sugar Importers
Association asked that the sugar trade be further liberalised.
    "The Food Department will cease trading in sugar and will no
longer hold a buffer stock," a senior official said.
    He said the government has finalised an agreement with
E.D.F.Man (Sugar) Ltd under which E.D.F.Man will hold a buffer
stock on the government's behalf of 20,000 tonnes, against the
45,000 tonne buffer stock usually held by the Department.
    Officials said the size of the buffer stock has been
reduced because the private sector will hold its own stocks.
    The agreement with E.D.F. Man includes details such as
trigger pricing mechanisms, they said.
    Four months ago the Department allowed the private sector
to import sugar without government clearance. The Department
and the private sector each imported around 115,000 tonnes of
sugar last year, when national consumption was 280,000 tonnes.
    An Importers Association official said that "even if the
Department no longer imports sugar, we would not necessarily
buy more."
    This is because the Association would still have to compete
with the Cooperatives Wholesale Establishment (CWE), he said.
    The CWE is a semi-government body and the official said
arrangements are being made for state cooperatives and holders
of food subsidy stamps to draw their sugar from it, starting
April 1.
    Ministry officials said the CWE can either import sugar or
buy it from a local bonded warehousing scheme run by E.D.F. For
the past two years.

<TITLE>JAPAN ASKS TRADERS, EXPORTERS TO CUT DOLLAR SALES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Ministry of International Trade and
Industry (MITI) has asked about 30 Japanese trading houses and
exporters to refrain from excessive dollar selling, trading
house officials said.
    The officials told Reuters MITI asked them to moderate
their foreign exchange trading because the excessive rise in
the yen will have unfavourable effects on the economy. It made
the request by telephone.
    A MITI official said the ministry has conducted a survey of
foreign exchange trading by trade houses and exporters. But he
said it was not aimed at moderating dollar selling.
    The trading house officials said MITI had asked them to
undertake foreign exchange transactions with due consideration
to the adverse effects excessive exchange rate movements would
have on the economy.
    The MITI official said MITI undertakes such surveys when
exchange rates fluctuate widely. A similiar survey was made
when the currency fell to the previous record low of 149.98 on
January 19. It hit a new record low of 148.20 yen yesterday.
    He said the survey showed currency transactions by trade
houses and exporters contributed little to the dollar fall.

yen of government financing bills tomorrow under a 29-day
repurchase accord maturing April 24 to soak up a projected

    The yield on the bills for sales to banks and securities
houses from money houses will be 3.9495 pct against the 3.9375
pct discount rate for one-month commercial bills and the
4.58/42 pct yield on one-month certificates of deposit today.

<TITLE>MIDDLE EAST CURRENCY MARKET SEES KEY CHANGES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Stephen Jukes, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Middle East currency dealers meet in
Abu Dhabi this weekend at a time of fundamental change in their
business, which has seen a growing volume of trade shift from
the Arab world to London.
    The 14th congress of the Inter-Arab Cambiste Association
also comes at a time when the prospect of a unified Gulf
currency system is more real that at any time this decade.
    Foreign exchange traders and bank treasurers said these
issues, and the slide of the Lebanese pound, can be expected to
be major talking points.
    About 250 traders and treasurers from some 115 banks --
including some in London and other major non-Arab financial
centres -- are expected to attend the conference which begins
on on Saturday.
    Bankers said it is hard to avoid the impression that a
growing proportion of transactions in the Saudi riyal market,
by far the largest in the region, is being carried out in
London.
    The market had been dominated by Saudi Arabia's 11 banks,
foreign exchange houses in the Kingdom and offshore banks in
Bahrain. But bankers said more and more Saudi and Bahrain-based
banks are boosting their treasury operations in London.
    As recession hit the Middle East and the need for trade
finance in the region declined, many offshore banks in Bahrain
ran down their currency operations. None of the four major U.K.
Clearing banks now has a dealing room on the island.
    The two major Bahrain-based international banks, &lt;Arab
Banking Corp> and &lt;Gulf International Bank BSC> have increased
their presence in London and Saudi banks are busy upgrading
representative offices to branch status to allow dealing.
    One economist said: "It is cheaper to run a riyal book in
London than staff an expensive offshore operation in Bahrain...
There is now the nucleus of a two-way market in London."
    Jeddah-based &lt;Riyad Bank> set up as a licensed deposit
taker in London in 1984, while its main rival in Saudi Arabia,
&lt;National Commercial Bank> (NCB) won a licence in November
1986.
    The major market maker has traditionally been London-based
consortium bank &lt;Saudi International Bank> but the kingdom
joint-venture &lt;Saudi American Bank> (SAMBA) also upgraded its
London operation to deposit taker status in mid-February.
    One senior currency trader in Riyadh said: "Inevitably the
volume of business in London has gained pace with the two new
licences for NCB and SAMBA, but there is no question that most
of the liquidity still rests in Saudi Arabia."
    Currency traders said the shift to London in the Saudi
riyal market is difficult to quantify.
    Bahrain Monetary Agency figures show regional currency
deposits held by offshore banks, most in Saudi riyals, dropped
to the equivalent of 12.2 billion dlrs at end-September 1986
from 13.4 billion at end-1985 and a 1983 peak of 15.0 billion.
    The shift has prompted changes in dealing habits. Riyal
trading in the Gulf on Saturdays and Sundays has become very
quiet with London closed while some Saudi and Bahrain banks now
staff offices on Friday, the Gulf weekend. Traders also expect
&lt;Arab National Bank> to step up London operations.
    Traders say it is difficult to foresee the riyal market
moving completely out of the region, partly because of local
demand and partly because of what is seen as the Saudi Arabian
Monetary Agency's (SAMA) desire to moderate
internationalisation of the riyal and protect it from undue
speculation.
    There have been far fewer signs of the Kuwaiti dinar market
shifting from its natural base of Kuwait and trading in Bahrain
and London is still limited.
    But for the first time since the formation of the six
nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in 1981 there are signs
that a much mooted currency union could come into force soon.
    Currency traders said it remains unclear what form a final
currency union would take for the six states -- Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.
    But plans to link the six currencies in a European Monetary
System style with a common peg have been discussed at high
level and could be a topic on the GCC's annual summit expected
to be held in Saudi Arabia late in the year.
    One dealer said: "A lot of exposure is being given to
discussions and plans appear to be quite advanced. But in the
end a political decision has to be taken to give the go-ahead."
    One open question is that of a common peg for currencies.
    The idea of linking the six currencies has been debated
since the start of the GCC. The Kuwaiti dinar is currently
linked to a basket of currencies while the other five
currencies are either officially or in practice linked to the
U.S. Dollar.
    Some traders said a currency union could mean speculation
against the Saudi riyal rubbing off on other Gulf currencies,
but plans call for a permitted divergence in the system of
7-1/4 pct, large enough to avoid sudden strains.
    Another topic for debate is expected to be the continued
slide of the Lebanese pound against the dollar and the
undermining of the effective capital base of Lebanese banks.

injunction in the U.K. High Court today to freeze the assets of
former Chairman Ernest Saunders in its attempts to recover 5.2
mln stg paid to a Jersey company as part of the company's
takeover battle for &lt;Distillers Co Plc>, a spokesman said.
    He said the court move aimed to freeze Saunders' assets up
to the value of the sum it wanted to recover. It was uncertain
whether the court would reach any decision on the request
today. Guinness said last week it planned to take legal action
to recover the funds, paid to non-executive director Thomas
Ward via the Jersey company.
    Lawyers representing Ward have said he saw the funds as his
reward for services performed during the takeover of
Distillers.
    Guinness is also planning a resolution at the annual
meeting in May to remove both Saunders and Ward from the
company's board.

<TITLE>MALAYSIA'S FOREIGN BORROWING HELD AT 1986 LEVEL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SINGAPORE, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Malaysia's net external borrowings
for 1987 are expected to be maintained at around last year's
levels of about 1.45 billion ringgit, Zain Azraai, secretary
general to the Finance Ministry, told an investment seminar
here.
    Malaysia's debt service ratio will also be maintained at "a
level no higher than 20 pct," he said. "This is well within the
capacity of the nation to service."
    Azraai said the 1986 foreign borrowing level and projected
estimates of 1987 compared favourably with the peak of around
5.5 billion ringgit in 1982.
    Malaysia's external debts total 48 to 49 billion ringgit
and its debt service ratio exceeds 20 pct, the Development Bank
of Singapore Ltd, one of Singapore's four major local banks,
said in a report released this week.
    Azraai said: "While the growth in debt has been rapid in
recent years, it is still within the limits of prudence and
conscious efforts have been made and will continue to be made
to decelerate and restrain external borrowings."
    He said the Malaysian government is urgently addressing the
twin deficits of the Federal Budget and the balance of payments
which followed two recessions in the 1980s.
    Azraai said Malaysia's public sector deficit had risen due
to the contraction in the government's resources as well as the
rapid growth in public expenditures.
    With declining incomes and export earnings, the bases for
resource generation became limited, and the government will not
raise taxes because current tax margins are high compared to
Malaysia's neighbours, he said.
    "As such the remaining avenue for rationalising and
consolidating the budget is through expenditure reductions," he
said.
    Azraai said the Malaysian government's development
expenditures were cut by about 25 pct in 1987, while those of
state enterprises were reduced by 41 pct.
    He said: "A commitment has been undertaken to reduce the
budget deficit over time and to balance the Federal
government's budget current account deficit by 1989."
    Malaysian Finance Minister Daim Zainuddin presented a
budget for 1987 which foresees a deficit of 9.4 billion
ringgit, down from 11.6 billion in 1986, with federal spending
targetted at 27.4 billion, down from 30.8 billion, and revenue
at 18 billion against 19.2 billion.
    Azraai said the government will cut the size of the public
sector and privatize those operations which may be better run
by the private sector. New measures have been introduced to
boost the private sector and attract foreign investment.
    A higher proportion of foreign ownership, even up to 100
pct, is now possible for new investments in the manufacturing
sector made between October 1986 and December 1990, he said.
    "The long term prospects of the Malaysian economy are bright
... Indications are already available to show that the economy
is recovering and that growth will be positive and stronger
than originally expected," Azraai said.

<DATELINE>    LUDWIGSHAFEN, West Germany, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>BASF AG &lt;BASF.F>
said net profit of its U.S. Operating company, BASF Corp, rose
last calendar year to 105 mln dlrs from 39 mln in 1985.
    Turnover rose by by more than one billion dlrs to 3.6
billion, the parent company said in a statement. The rise,
however, partly reflected the inclusion of the first full
business year of three acquisitions made in 1985. Excluding
these, BASF Corp turnover rose four pct from 1985.
    Acquisitions were the high-performance connecting materials
operations of Celanese Corp, Inmont Corp bought from United
Technologies and American Enka bought from AKZO NV &lt;AKZO.AS>.
    BASF said it expected a U.S. Investment of 240 mln dlrs in
1987, part of a five-year programme totalling one billion.
    U.S. Projects completed in 1986 included the second acrylic
acid plant in Freeport, Texas, a technical centre in
Southfield, Michigan, in which paint lines from automotive
plants can be refitted, and the new agricultural research
centre in Research Triangle Park in Durham, North Carolina.
    BASF said that work this year had begun in Geismar,
Louisiana, on plants for production of special amines and
polytetrahydrofuran, as well as for expansion of capacity for
producing tetrahydrofuran.

seasonally adjusted 48.22 pct in the year to end-February,
after rising 54.96 pct in the year to January, a central bank
spokesman said.
    Month on month, M1-B fell 5.19 pct from January.
    Unadjusted February M1-B was 1,168 billion dlrs against
1,232 billion in January and 788 billion in February 1986.
    Money supply grew faster in January because the central
bank issued more currency for bonus payments made to workers at
the Lunar New Year, which fell on January 29 this year, banking
sources said.

<TITLE>NIPPON STEEL TO REDUCE DIVIDEND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Nippon Steel Corp &lt;NSTC.T> plans to
reduce its dividend to three yen in the year ending March 31
1987 from the five yen of 1985/86, a company spokesman said.
    The company estimated parent company current losses at 15
billion yen in 1986/87, including a gain of 95 billion yen from
the sale of securities. This compares with a 36.07 billion yen
profit a year earlier.
    Sales in 1986/87 are seen at 2,150 billion yen, down from
2,685 billion a year ago.
    Poor business prospects were attributed to the yen's rise
and slow world steel demand. Nippon is expected to report
parent company results in late May.
    Total 1986/87 crude steel production is estimated at 25.57
mln tonnes, down from 27.98 mln a year earlier.
    Crude steel production is likely to be below 1986/87 output
but forecasts for profits and sales in the year starting April
1 are unavailable yet, he said.

<TITLE>BAT SEES STRONG PERFORMANCE FROM ALL SECTORS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>A strong performance from all BAT
Industries Plc's &lt;BTI.L> major sectors enabled the group's 1986
pretax profits to pass the one billion stg level for the third
year running, Chairman Patrick Sheehy said in a statement.
    The group earlier reported a 19 pct rise in profits to 1.39
billion, which Sheehy said was achieved without any help from
exchange rate fluctuations or acquisitions.
    Good results were achieved by its Argos and Saks Fifth
Avenue in retailing and by Wiggins Teape and Appleton in paper.
    Tobacco accounted for about 50 pct of profit with a four
pct gain to 764 mln stg and a two pct increase in world volume.
    The results were largely in line with analysts expectations
and BAT shares firmed by two pence to 537p at 0955 GMT.
    BAT said the U.S. Brown and Williamson unit held most of
its 1985 gains and increased profit 18 pct in dollar terms.
    Financial services saw profits double to 282 mln with both
Eagle Star and Allied Dunbar achieving further growth.
    Allied Dunbar reported a 51 pct rise in life annual
premiums to 39 mln stg. BAT said it increased new business by
38 pct in the last nine months after a relatively slow first
quarter. Its permanent health insurance was now the market
leader and its Unit Trust group was now the second largest in
the U.K.
    Eagle Star general premiums rose 32 pct to 1.03 billion.
Its life activities also grew 39 pct with better underwriting
results in the second half.
    Cash flow was strong and the gross debt to equity ratio
dropped to 41 pct from 51 pct. The net ratio, at 26 pct, left
the group strongly placed to pursue its further development.
    Profits from paper and pulp grew 29 pct to 217 mln stg,
nearly three times the 1982 level, with Wiggins Teape's sales
rising 36 pct to pass one billion stg.
    BAT said in 1986 it had sold 88 BATUS stores in the U.S.
For 644 mln dlrs and sold Grovewood Securities for 142 mln stg.

<TITLE>TAIWAN SEES ITS INVESTMENT IN U.S. RISING SHARPLY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Taiwanese investment in the U.S. Is
expected to nearly double to 80 mln U.S. Dlrs in calendar 1987
and rise to 400 mln dlrs a year by 1991, a five-year forecast
by the Economic Ministry showed.
    Taiwanese investment in the U.S. Last year totalled 46 mln
dlrs, the ministry document said. The investment was mainly in
electronics, trading, food and service industries.
    Lee Ming-Yi, deputy director of the ministry's Industrial
Development and Investment Centre, said the forecast rise is
due to planned government incentives and growing willingness
among Taiwanese to invest abroad.
    Lee told Reuters the incentives, to be introduced in May or
June, include bank loans and a reduction in capitalisation
requirements for businesses seeking to invest in the U.S. To 10
mln Taiwan dlrs from 20 mln.
    He said the moves to encourage investment in the U.S. Are
part of Taiwan's efforts to cut its trade surplus with
Washington, which rose to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in
1986 from 1985's 10.2 billion.
    Taiwanese manufacturers can create jobs for Americans and
avoid import quotas if they set up plants in the U.S., He
added.

<TITLE>PLACER PACIFIC SAYS BIG BELL GOLD STUDY EXPANDING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Placer Pacific Ltd> said it will
undertake a full feasibility study of Western Australia's Big
Bell gold prospect.
    Results of an economic evaluation of the find, in which
Placer has an option with &lt;Australian Consolidated Minerals
Ltd> (ACM) to earn a 50 pct interest, were encouraging enough
to warrant a full study, Placer said in a statement.
    Big Bell, in the Murchison goldfield 540 km north east of
Perth, was founded in 1904. Between 1937 and 1955 it yielded
22.8 tonnes of gold and 7.8 tonnes of silver while milling
about 30,000 tonnes of ore a month.
    Placer has said the prospect has an estimated 14 mln tonnes
of ore with a three-gram-per-tonne concentration accessible by
open-pit mining and a further 4.5 mln tonnes with a
4.4-gram-a-tonne concentration between 300 and 600 meters
underground.
    It said it was obliged to produce the feasibility study no
later than December 31 this year by which time it would have
spent three mln dlrs on Big Bell.
    If the results are positive and a commitment to develop
made then construction would take about 12 months, Placer said.

    The predicted slowdown of the U.S. Automobile industry is

performance in the FATA European group during 1986 is expected
to continue into this year.
    In the U.K. Overall profitability will improve when the
Central Electricity Generating Board's ordering programme for
both nuclear and fossil-fired fuels starts.

<TITLE>CHINA TO TIGHTEN IMPORT CONTROL, CUT EXPORT COSTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>China should tighten imports of ordinary
goods and restrict or even forbid import of goods which can be
made domestically, Premier Zhao Ziyang said.
    He told the National People's Congress, China's parliament,
that the country's foreign exchange is limited and must be used
where it is most needed.
    "We should expand production of import substitutes and
increase their proportion," he said.
    On exports, China should increase its proportion of
manufactured goods, especially textiles, light industrial
goods, electronics and machinery, he said.
    Zhao said China should lower the cost of exports and
control the export of goods that incur too much loss. In 1986
China had a trade deficit of 11.9 billion dlrs, down from a
record 14 billion in 1985.
    Zhao said China should work to provide a more favourable
investment environment for foreign businessmen. It should use
foreign funds for production and construction, with stress on
firms making goods for export or import substitutes.
    China should also earn more foreign exchange from tourists
and contracted labour abroad, he added.

will grow six pct in the first quarter and five pct in the
second quarter this year, with further growth expected in the
second half, Trade and Industry Minister Lee Hsien Loong told
parliament.
    The figures compared with 3.4 pct contraction and 1.2 pct
growth respectively for the first and second quarters of 1986.
    The estimates were based on a tentative leading indicator
incorporating new business orders, company inventories and
share prices used by his ministry, Lee said, without giving
further details of the new indicator.
    Singapore's economy grew 1.9 pct last year, after shrinking
1.8 pct in 1985. The government has forecast growth rate of
three to four pct for 1987.

<TITLE>KLOECKNER UND CO'S 1986 PROFIT FALLS ABOUT 20 PCT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DUISBURG, West Germany, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Kloeckner &amp; Co KGaA, the
international trading group, said its 1986 domestic group net
profit fell by around 20 pct against 1985, adding that the
profit resulted largely from a writing back of reserves.
    The company, which gave no 1986 profit figures, posted a
domestic group net profit of 41 mln marks in 1985.
    It said the 1986 profit was made possible through a 40 mln
mark write-back of reserves that had been created to cover
possible price rises. These reserves were no longer necessary
because of recent declines in raw material prices.
    Kloeckner attributed the profit decline to the fall in
prices as well as the lower value of the dollar.
    It said it would pay an unchanged dividend on its ordinary
share capital, which is entirely in private hands and held
largely by family foundations.
    Kloeckner's nominal 100 mark profit-participation
certificates, issued in October 1986, will pay a likely yield
of around 10 pct. Holders of the certificates are entitled to a
quarter of the 1986 payment, or around 2.50 marks, the company
added.

<TITLE>MIXED ASIAN REACTION TO NEW RUBBER PACT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rajan Moses, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    KUALA LUMPUR, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Governments of major Asian
producing countries have welcomed the conclusion of a new
International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA), but growers and
traders are unhappy with the development, according to views
polled by Reuter correspondents.
    Officials in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, which
produce the bulk of the world's rubber, said they expected the
new pact to continue to stabilise prices and help their rubber
industries remain viable in the long-term.
    But traders and growers said they were against the new pact
because its buffer stock mechanism was likely to interefere
with free market forces and prevent sharp rubber price rises.
    The new INRA, to replace the current one which expires on
October 22, was formally adopted by most of the world's
producers and consumers in Geneva last Friday.
    It will be open for signature at the U.N. Headquarters in
New York from May 1 to December 31 this year and will enter
into force provisionally when ratified by countries accounting
for 75 pct of world rubber exports and 75 pct of world imports.
    Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik said
the formal adoption of a new pact had dispelled fears of
liquidation of some 360,000 tonnes of INRA buffer stock rubber
and a possible depression of prices.
    He expressed confidence that the new INRA would continue to
keep prices stable by selling or buying rubber as prices rose
or fell through its buffer stock system.
    Malaysia was also happy that in the new INRA financing of
purchases for the normal buffer stock of 400,000 tonnes and a
contingency buffer stock of 150,000 tonnes would be done
through direct cash contributions from members, he said.
    Under the existing pact, members can borrow from banks to
finance INRA's buffer stock purchases. This has been viewed
with concern by some members who fear the INRA may become
indebted and ultimately face collapse, like the International
Tin Agreement.
    "This will ensure the buffer stock operation is carried out
without any financial encumbrance," Lim said.
     Malaysia, the world's largest producer, was seeking
cabinet approval to join the new INRA and hoped other producers
and consumers would also become members, he said.
    Officials in Jakarta said the new pact would bring benefit
to Indonesia's rubber industry's by stabilising prices.
    It was unlikely to collapse like the tin agreement because
its new financial provisions had been tightened, they said.
    Thai officials told Reuters they were optimistic the new
pact was viable because it strictly limited the extent of debt
the INRA buffer stock manager might commit to his market
operations.
     Malaysian growers, however, said they preferred a free
rubber market because an INRA had a tendency to keep prices at
levels that were only acceptable to consumers.
    "With the INRA's ability to keep prices at a certain stable
level, consumers are assured of rubber at almost a fixed price,
while producers may never see sharp price rises," a Malaysian
Rubber Producers Council source told Reuters.
    Producers also wanted a free rubber market without the
overhang of a 360,000 tonne INRA buffer stock which had
psychologically prevented price rises, he said.
    State plantation officials in Sri Lanka said prices had
been depressed since INRA's inception and the creation of a
buffer stock, and they seemed unlikely to rise.
    Sri Lanka should not be a member of the INRA because it was
expensive to maintain a buffer stock, they added.
    Traders in the region, meanwhile, said prices might be
pressured by the new pact in the long term as its potential to
stabilise prices and buffer stock capacity would spur producers
to produce more.
    Most Malaysian and Singapore traders said the new pact's
conclusion had little impact on prices and it was unlikely to
allow sharp price fluctuations in future.
    "The 360,000 tonnes in the INRA buffer stock must be
liquidated and a free market returned," a Malaysian trader said.
    Japanese traders said the new pact had a chance for success
as most world producers and consumers had adopted it, but they
questioned the ability of some financially-strapped producers
to finance buffer stock operations.

<TITLE>SWIRE EXPECTS CONTINUED GROWTH THIS YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Swire Pacific Ltd &lt;SWPC.HKG> expects
continued growth in all divisions this year though it sees
problems in the marine sector, chairman Michael Miles said.
    He told reporters:"1987 has started well for Cathay Pacific
Airways which looks forward to another good year... Swire
Properties expects further good results both from properties
under development for sale and from its investment property
portfolio."
    He did not give any specific projections for earnings. The
company earlier reported 46 pct higher 1986 net profits at 1.78
billion H.K. Dlrs from a year ago.
    Swire also had an extraordinary profit of 1.38 billion dlrs
mainly from the sale of a 15.25 pct interest in Cathay Pacific
Airways Ltd &lt;CAPH.HKG>.
    Miles said the company will use the money to develop its
business, primarily in Hong Kong.
    Swire's stake in Cathay was first reduced to 54.25 pct from
70 pct when Cathay was publicly floated, and then cut to 50.25
pct when Cathay issued new shares amounting to 12 pct of the
enlarged capital to the state-owned &lt;China International Trust
and Investment Corp>. Cathay last week reported its 1986
profits rose to 1.23 billion dlrs from 777 mln a year ago.
    Miles said despite last year's rapid expansion in Cathay's
flights and fleet, load factor is still holding up at 70 pct.
    He said Cathay's growth last year was the result of "a
marginal increase in the revenue load factor coupled with
savings in fuel costs."
    "At present fuel prices are stable and will remain stable
for the rest of this year," he said, "though there might be a bit
of increase later this year.''
    Miles said Swire is not abandoning its offshore oil service
operations, even though the marine sector is generally
depressed. "Obviously the marine industry is not getting any
better," he said.
    The real estate market remained strong and Swire last year
revalued its property portfolio up 634 mln dlrs compared with
an increase of 864.4 mln dlrs the previous year.
    Miles said he expects the property market to remain firm
but said the firm has no available land for a major housing
project such as its Taikoo Shing development on Hong Kong
island now near completion.
    He said the company's 50 pct unit &lt;Hongkong United Dockyard
Ltd> is negotiating with the government for the development of
an existing petroleum storage depot into a major housing
estate. "But it's not as big as Taikoo Shing," he said.

<TITLE>UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDS EC SUGAR TENDER RESULT-TRADE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Considerable uncertainty surrounds the
outcome of today's EC white sugar tender, traders here said,
noting it remains overshadowed by European operator threats to
move over 800,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention.
    They said that due to the dispute between the Commission
and producers over the issue, it is not clear whether the
Commission will authorise any exports at all or grant licences
on a large tonnage.
    The subsidy is seen being set above 45.00 Ecus per 100
kilos, although traders are reluctant to predict a precise
level after prices fell yesterday.
    Earlier, traders in Paris said they expected the Commission
to award licences for around 50,000 tonnes of white sugar with
a maximum export rebate of 45.75 to 46.0 Ecus.
    Last week, the Commission granted licences to end August on
60,500 tonnes of whites at a maximum rebate of 44.819.

<TITLE>ABU DHABI TO REOPEN GULF OILFIELD HIT IN 1986 RAID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ABU DHABI, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Abu Dhabi's offshore Abu al-Bukhoosh
oilfield in the Gulf, shut since an aerial attack last
November, will reopen when new anti-aircraft defences are
ready, and this could be in the next two months, oil industry
sources said.
    They said the Abu Dhabi government and Compagnie Francaise
des Petroles (Total) &lt;TPN.PA>, whose Total Abu al-Bukhoosh
subsidiary owns 51 pct of the field, have agreed on the
reopening, but that a date has not been definitely fixed.
    Unidentified planes hit the field, 100 miles off Abu Dhabi,
last November 25.
    The raid killed eight workers and destroyed the main living
quarters and a bridge linking a wellhead to the main production
platform.
    Western diplomats in the region say Iran was responsible
but Tehran has blamed its Gulf War enemy Iraq.
    Abu al-Bukhoosh was producing 57,000 barrels per day (bpd)
at the time of the attack, but the sources said it would resume
at a maximum of half that level because of reduced staff and
the fact only four of five wellheads were now operable.
    The sources said only 80 personnel can be housed in
remaining accomodations, the sources said.
    Facilities being installed to protect the field include
aircraft detection equipment, anti-aircraft missiles, housing
for military personnel and helicopter landing pads, the sources
said.
    Abu Dhabi is the largest oil producer in the United Arab
Emirates, accounting for about 800,000 bpd of its total 1.15
mln bpd production, the sources said.
    They also said Iran was working to reopen its Sassan field,
part of the same reservoir as Abu al-Bukhoosh and located only
a few miles away. Sassan was heavily damaged by an Iraqi air
raid only 10 days before Abu al-Bukhoosh was attacked.

    It said in a statement it has bought an extra 9.4 mln

    Progressive is currently the subject of both a proposed

4.20 dlrs a share. The Rainbow merger involves shareholders in
both Rainbow and Progressive being issued shares in a new

    Rainbow chief executive Craig Heatley said, "In our opinion
BIL's actions over the last few days have been undertaken for
their own strategic purposes which conflict with the desire of
both companies to merge their interests."
    BIL has said it is against the merger because it sees
Progressive shares as being worth twice as as much as

at 4.30 at the end of morning trading on the New Zealand Stock

<TITLE>BANK OF THAILAND PLANS ITS FIRST BOND ISSUE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BANGKOK, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Thailand is seeking Finance
Ministry approval to issue its first bond, central bank sources
said.
    The planned three billion baht issue would carry a term of
six months to one year as a short term move to mop up surplus
funds held by commercial banks.
    The issue would offer a coupon attractive to commercial
banks, which currently have an estimated 30 to 60 billion baht
in funds invested in low-yield securities, the sources said.
    The central bank, charged with supervision of commercial
banks, has previously issued only Finance Ministry bonds.
    Private bankers said they are awaiting a central bank
decision on whether to allow commercial banks to continue
holding up to 40 pct of their capital in foreign exchange or to
return it to 20 pct as scheduled.
    The six month 40 pct ceiling expires April 6 but the banks
want it extended for six more months.
    They said a forced cut in foreign exchange positions would
worsen the local liquidity problem as commercial banks would
have to convert about five billion baht worth of foreign
currencies in their portfolios into baht.
    Senior central bank officials suggested to reporters last
week that the foreign exchange ceiling will be lowered to
discourage banks' use of excess funds for currency speculation.
    Central bank sources said some commercial banks,
anticipating such a central bank decision, have been converting
their foreign currencies into baht this week and lending the
additional funds to the Bank of Thailand's short-term loan
repurchase facility.
    They said the Bank of Thailand's repurchase window
yesterday received offers of about three billion baht of
investment funds from commercial banks, three times its normal
daily amount.
    The repurchase window uses government bonds as an
instrument with which commercial banks can borrow from or lend
to the state bank.
    The facility is sometimes used by the central bank to set a
local short-term interest benchmark through fixing its bond
repurchase rates.

<TITLE>YEN MAY RISE TO 140 TO THE DLR, NIKKEIREN SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>The yen could rise to 140 yen to the
dollar, a leading Japanese businessman said.
    Bumpei Otsuki, president of the influential Japan
Federation of Employers' Associations, (Nikkeiren), told
reporters: "The yen might rise as far as 140 (to the dollar).
The U.S. Economy is not good, and as long as the U.S. Economy
is not good, the U.S. Will put various pressures (on Japan)."
    "The yen's level depends on the condition of the U.S.
Economy rather than Japan's economy, and as long as the
American situation is bad, the yen will continue to rise," he
said.
    To cope with the negative impact of the strong yen,
Japanese enterprises must strive to cut costs by all means,
including holding down wages as much as possible, Otsuki said.
    He rejected recent calls from some government quarters for
wage increases this year as a means of raising private
consumption and thus boosting domestic demand.
    "We have to keep wages as low as possible," he said.
    He also said the yen's large and rapid rise is depressing
the outlook for the Japanese economy, noting that in addition
to hurting exporters it is also damaging domestic market
manufacturers through cheap imports.
    Parts of the service sector are also threatened, Otsuki
said.
    Tertiary industries provide services to manufacturers and a
downturn in manufacturing profits will adversely affect service
industries, he said.
    It is also doubtful whether the tertiary sector can fully
employ those put out of work in the manufacturing sector, he
said.
    Profits of service sector companies are likely to fall in
the business year ending in March 1988, leading to a possible
recession in the Japanese economy, he said.
    Otsuki said economic growth is unlikely to pick up beyond
levels experienced in 1986.
    The government's Economic Planning Agency said last week
the economy grew at 2.5 pct in 1986, the worst performance
since 1974 when the economy shrank 1.4 pct due to the first oil
price crisis.
    In order to stimulate domestic demand and boost the
economy, tax reforms aimed at bringing down the cost of land
and reforming the nation's housing stock are needed, along with
steps to bring down the high cost of commodities, he said.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Japan bought a modest amount
of dollars this morning, possibly around 200 to 300 mln,
dealers said.
    One dealer said the central bank bought about 200 mln dlrs
through brokers and the rest through banks. The buying began
when the dollar was at about 149.60 yen, and helped drive the
U.S. Currency up to around 150, he said.
    Another said the central bank seemed to be trying to push
the dollar up above 150 yen. But heavy selling at around that
level quickly pushed the dollar back down towards 149 yen,
dealers said.

<TITLE>BRAZIL/BANK COMMITTEE AGREE ON CREDIT REQUEST</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MIAMI, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil and its bank advisory committee
agreed to transmit a request for an extension of short-term
credit lines totaling 16 billion dlrs for 60 days until May 31,
Brazilian Central Bank President Francisco Gros said.
    Speaking after talks with the committee here, Gros also
said he did not expect to make interest payment to the banks at
this moment.
    He added that "no one should expect any dramatic
developments before March 31."
    Brazil last month suspended interest payments on its 68
billion dlrs debt to commercial banks and froze short-term
trade and money market lines.
    Bankers said they would relay the Brazilian request for an
extension but declined to say whether they were specifically
endorsing it.
    Gros said the decision, which he called a "standstill"
arrangement, will be communicated to Brazil's 700 bank
creditors by telex tomorrow. Banks had been pressing Brazil to
make at least a token interest payment, but Gros said the
government was unable to comply for the moment.
    He stressed however that Brazil was willing to pay as soon
as it could, but added that a payment of interest was not
connected with the extension of the credit lines.
    "That would not be wise," he said.
    He said that the extension of the short-term lines would
not be carried out through "an official instrument" as there was
not time to complete the legal requirements.
    Gros said Brazil was likely to meet again with the 14-bank
advisory committee once Brazil had information to present on an
economic plan.

<TITLE>JAPAN DOES NOT INTEND TO CUT DISCOUNT RATE-SUMITA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita
said the central bank has no intention of cutting its discount
rate again as a way of preventing the yen's rise.
    He told a press conference that the growth of Japanese
money supply remains high.
    The bank will have to watch closely various developments
resulting from its already eased monetary stance, such as the
sharp rise in real estate and stock prices, he said.
    Although the yen's rise will have a greater deflationary
impact on the economy, the economy is not likely to slow down
much further, Sumita said.
    "I don't think we should change our economic outlook at the
moment," Sumita said.
    Sumita has said in the past that he expects the economy to
show a gradual upturn in the second half of the year.
    The governor said the six major industrial nations are
expected to review last month's pact on currency stability when
they meet next in April.
    Dealers said they expect the six - Britain, Canada, France,
Japan, the U.S. Amd West Germany - to meet just before the
IMF/World Bank interim committee meeting in Washington starting
on April 9.

yen of government financing bills tomorrow under a 29-day
repurchase accord maturing April 24 to soak up a projected
money market surplus, market sources said.
    The surplus is estimated at 350 billion yen, due mainly to
excess bank holdings of yen funds after heavy dollar purchases
in the foreign exchange market yesterday, money traders said.
    The yield on the bills for sales to banks and securities
houses from money houses will be 3.9495 pct against the 3.9375
pct discount rate for one-month commercial bills and the
4.58/42 pct yield on one-month certificates of deposit today.
    The operation will put the outstanding bill supply at about
1,900 billion yen, money traders said.

<TITLE>EXCHANGE RATES ALMOST WITHIN G-6 LEVELS - SUMITA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita
said that current exchange rates are almost within the levels
agreed to by six major nations last month in Paris.
    Asked whether a dollar/yen rate of 148 or 149 reflected
economic fundamentals, he said current rates almost reflect
fundamentals.
    Sumita told reporters major nations have cooperated to
bring about currency stability in line with the Paris
agreement, which stipulated that they would closely cooperate
to that end. He repeated the central bank will intervene if
necessary, adding he did not think a dollar free-fall was
likely.
    But Sumita said he could not say exactly what currency
levels would be considered in line with underlying economic
fundamentals.
    In Paris on February 22, Britain, Canada, France, Japan,
the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate to hold
currencies around their then current levels.
    Sumita said he could not find any specific reasons behind
the fall of the dollar to a record low against the yen
yesterday. But he said the market rushed to sell dollars as it
nervously reacted to statements abroad and to developments
surrounding trade tensions.
    U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said over the weekend
that the Paris pact did not encompass fixed tragets for the
dollar. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter called
U.S/Japan relations on certain key trade issues very strained.
    The market reacted nervously because the dollar has been
moving narrowly against the yen since mid-January, Sumita said.
He added he does not expect the yen/dollar exchange rate to
remain unstable because the market is concerned about a sharp
rise of the yen.
    The Bank of Japan will keep a close watch on exchange rates
in line with the Paris accord, he added.

<TITLE>JAPAN ASKS TRADERS, EXPORTERS TO CUT DOLLAR SALES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Ministry of International Trade and
Industry (MITI) has asked about 30 Japanese trading houses and
exporters to refrain from excessive dollar selling, trading
house officials said.
    The officials told Reuters MITI asked them to moderate
their foreign exchange trading because the excessive rise in
the yen will have unfavourable effects on the economy. It made
the request by telephone.
    A MITI official said the ministry has conducted a survey of
foreign exchange trading by trade houses and exporters. But he
said it was not aimed at moderating dollar selling.
    The trading house officials said MITI had asked them to
undertake foreign exchange transactions with due consideration
to the adverse effects excessive exchange rate movements would
have on the economy.
    The MITI official said MITI undertakes such surveys when
exchange rates fluctuate widely. A similiar survey was made
when the currency fell to the previous record low of 149.98 on
January 19. It hit a new record low of 148.20 yen yesterday.
    He said the survey showed currency transactions by trade
houses and exporters contributed little to the dollar fall.

strong yen rises against the dollar during London trading this
morning, dealers said.
    The Bank of Japan here declined comment.
    The Bank of England was also rumored to be buying dollars
against the yen this morning but it also declined comment.
    Dealers said the intervention halted a sudden late morning
drop to a low of 148.65 yen, holding the dollar steady until
midsession at about 148.80.
    The Bank of England was strongly rumored to have intervened
on behalf of the dollar against the yen yesterday, but it gave
no confirmation.
    Overnight reports from Tokyo said that the Bank of Japan
was aggressively supporting the dollar, but failed to push it
back to the perceived target level of 150 yen.
    Selling during the London trading morning was largely
attributed to Japanese institutions.
    Dealers here were loath to quantify the scale of Bank of
Japan action this morning. One U.S. Bank trader said it could
have been up to 500 mln dlrs, but said this was largely a
guess.

<TITLE>BRAZIL, BANKS FAIL TO MAKE BREAKTHROUGH IN DEBT TALKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Keith Grant</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MIAMI, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil and its bank creditors failed to
achieve any breakthrough in debt talks here last night after
Brazil refused to say when it would resume interest payments.
    Central Bank governor Francisco Gros said after a meeting
with a 14-bank advisory committee that Brazil cannot make any
interest payments at this time, though it would do so "as soon
as we can."
    The talks came as the annual meeting of the 44-nation
Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), in which both Gros and
the bankers had been taking part, moved toward a close here.
    Bankers leaving the meeting with Gros declined to discuss
details of the talks, though some expressed satisfaction that
Brazil had agreed to continue working with the committee.
    At the same time, Gros told reporters not to expect any
dramatic developments before March 31, the date when some U.S.
banks have said they will take a decision whether to put Brazil
loans on a non-performing basis.
    Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlr
foreign debt to commercial banks on February 20 and shortly
after announced it was freezing some 16 billion dlrs in
short-term credit lines.
    Banks are not obliged to declare these loans non-performing
before 90 days have elapsed, but the move to announce a
possible decision in this respect was viewed as a means of
exerting pressure on Brazil.
    The bank committee, headed by Citibank, had been pressing
Brazil to make at least a token payment of interest but Gros
said this was not possible right now.
    "We are not in a position to make a payment at this stage,"
Gros said.
    At the same time, the two sides reached a stopgap
arrangement on the short-term trade and money-market credit
lines, whereby the committee agreed to transmit a Brazilian
request to extend the lines for 60 days until May 31.
    Banks have been indicating they will not renew credit lines
in response to the Brazilian move.

BICC SEEKS ACCELERATED EARNINGS GROWTH LONDON, March 25 - BICC
Plc &lt;BICC.L>, which earlier announced a 10 pct rise in 1986
pre-tax profits, said it was determined to achieve higher
levels of performance, quality and service to accelerate its
improvement in earnings.
    BICC said in a statement that sales in BICC Cables were
down on 1985 due to a sharp drop in demand for cable in the oil
and chemical industries after the oil price drop. But profits
in Balfour Beatty were substantially improved.
    Profits increased in BICC Technologies and in BICC
International in local currency terms, while Associated British
Cables had another excellent year, the company said.
    BICC shares were last quoted at 357p, up from 344p at
yesterday's close, in buoyant response to results which were
ahead of market expectations, dealers said.
    BICC pre-tax profits rose to 101 mln stg in 1986 from 92
mln in 1985, with turnover rising from 2.11 billion stg in 1985
to 2.14 billion stg in 1986.

<DATELINE>    LANDOVER, Md., March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Dart Group Corp> said it has
raised its offer to acquire Supermarkets General Corp to 42.00
dlrs in cash and three dlrs in exchangeable preferred stock per
Supermarkets General share from 41.75 dlrs per share in cash.
    The company said it would also be willing to negotiate a
plan with the Supermarkets General board under which
Supermarkets General shareholders would have a common stock
interest in the combined company.  It said it remains willing
to negotiate all terms of the proposed acquisition.
    The original bid was worth about 1.62 billion dlrs.
    Dart said the preferred stock in the new bid would be
exchangeable for a new class of Supermarkets General debt
securities that would be developed by Dart and Supermarkets.
    The new proposal would be subject to approval by the
Supermarkets General board, it said.  The new bid was contained
in a letter to the Supermarkets General board.
    In Woodbridge, N.J., Supermarkets General -- responding to
a previous letter to its board by Dart -- said "Your conduct
indicates to us that no transaction involving trust and
confidence can be entered into with you.  Your propaganda and
missstatements will not panic our board."
    Dart, in its previous letter, had alleged that Supermarkets
General executives were seeking millions of dollar in severance
and tax payments from Dart.

<TITLE>LONDON ON RISE AS TRADING CENTRE IN U.S. DEBT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Norma Cohen, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>London's rise as a trading centre for
U.S. Government debt has been spurred by the increasing use of
interest rate swaps, which are now arranged for most new issues
in the eurobond markets, traders and analysts said.
    Indeed, eurobond traders estimate that about 80 pct of all
new debt issued here last year -- over 186 billion dlrs worth
-- was part of either an interest rate or currency swap.
    "The U.S. Treasuries market here is swap-driven," said David
Jones, vice president at Goldman Sachs and Co international and
head of its U.S. Government bond trading desk.
    "It is commonplace to have trades of 100 mln dlrs or more in
10-years, seven years or five years, all related to an interest
rate swap or hedging of a eurobond deal," Jones said at a recent
conference on the U.S. Treasuries market.
    Just a year or so ago, he said, trades of that size going
through brokers screens in London were unthinkable.
    Traders said that over the past two weeks, while trading in
U.S. Treasuries has been almost frozen by indecision over the
direction of interest rates, swap-related deals have provided
the sole source of new business.
    Dealers said that last week, a 260 mln dlr trade involving
two and 10-year Treasuries was transacted on brokers' screens.
    The trade, they said, was swap related.
    There are no firm figures on exactly how much U.S. Treasury
debt is traded here and estimates vary widely.
    But Wrightson Economics, a U.S.-based research firm which
drew its data from U.S. Treasury reports, estimated that gross
transactions in U.S. Government securities in London rose to
341 billion dlrs in the first nine months of 1986 alone,
against 188 billion in all of 1985.
    Wrightson estimates that about 20 pct of all U.S. Treasury
trading is transacted outside the U.S., With Tokyo forming the
third major centre.
    And while figures are not yet available for the last
quarter, the anecdotal evidence suggests that the trend
continued, traders say.
    Richard Lacy, chief executive at Exco International, put
average daily Treasuries trading volume in London at about 15
billion dlrs. Exco recently purchased an 80 pct interest in RMJ
Securities inc, one of the four major brokers in U.S.
Government bonds which has offices in London, New York and
Tokyo.
    But Dick Van Splinter, president of RMJ's competitor,
Fundamental Brokers Inc's London operations, estimates average
daily turnover is no more than four to five billion dlrs.
    But even at the low range of estimates, Treasuries trading
volume is at least equal to that in the U.K.'s own government
bonds, known as gilts.
     Jeremy Ford, vice president at Bankers Trust International
Ltd, explained that U.S. Treasuries are used by intermediaries
in swap transactions to lock in the "spread," the difference
between the interest rate the borrower has to pay and the rate
that the counterparty is obliged to pay.
    But even beyond swap-related activity, dealers said the
nature of trading in London has changed.
    "The interesting thing our figures show is the transition in
London from a marketing effort to a trading effort," said Louis
Crandall, an economist at Wrightson who has been collecting the
data.
    Crandall said that previously, firms' activities were
limited to trying to sell U.S. Securities to European
investors. Now, however, they appear increasingly willing act
as principal in transactions rather than acting on behalf of
their New York offices.
    Increasingly, traders say, firms maintain separate profit
and loss sheets for their London operations so that trading
decisions can be made independently from the U.S. Headquarters.
    Many of the major U.S. Firms, including Merrill Lynch and
Co, Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc and Chemical Bank trade for
their own accounts here.
    Also, traders point out, the number of U.S. Firms operating
in London has increased sharply over the past year, as has the
number of European and Asian banks which trade U.S. Government
securities.
    Within the past few months, National
Westminster Bank Plc's County Bank subsidiary and Swiss Bank
Corp have applied to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to
become primary dealers in U.S. Government securities and their
London offices have just recently received direct-dealing
brokers screens.
    And Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette, already a primary dealer, is
preparing to open a U.S. Treasuries trading desk in London.
    Dick Van Splinter, president of Fundamental Brokers Inc,
the largest of the four major government bond brokers here,
said he now has 45 firms using direct-dealing screens, up from
35 a year ago.

<TITLE>OIL ANALYST SEES PAPUA NEW GUINEA AS GOOD PROSPECT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SURFERS PARADISE, Australia, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Papua New Guinea
(PNG) provides the most exciting new prospect in the
Asia-Pacific region for oil production, energy analyst Fereidun
Fesharaki said here.
    The recent successful find at Iagifu is likely to put PNG
on the list of major oil exporters by the early 1990s, he told
the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annual
conference.
    Fesharaki, leader of the Energy Program at the East-West
Center in Honolulu, Hawaii, was speaking on the Asia-Pacific
petroleum outlook.
    With domestic demand of around 12,000 barrels per day (bpd)
and prospects of production of over 100,000 bpd by late 1991,
PNG would become an Ecuador-level crude exporter, Fesharaki
said.
    The Iagifu wells in the Papuan Basin have recorded the best
oil flows in more than 60 years of exploration in PNG.
    The PNG government's Geological Survey in a paper
distributed at the conference estimates Iagifu reserves at
about 500 mln barrels.
    PNG enjoys the most liberal tax regime in the region with
no secondary taxes, Fesharaki said.
    "We expect a much larger oil search in Papua New Guinea, and
discovery of much larger volumes of oil, similar in quality to
(light) Bass Strait crude," Fesharaki said.
    There are also large pockets of high quality condensates to
be produced, notably in the Juha field near Iagifu which is
capable of producing 30,000 to 40,000 bpd, he said.
    But prices should be somewhat higher than the present
levels to justify development of the Juha field, he said.
    The PNG Geological Survey paper noted there are five large
prospective but little-explored sedimentary basins in PNG.

<TITLE>YUGOSLAVIA SEEKS 600 MLN ECU LOAN FROM EC</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BELGRADE, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Yugoslavia is seeking a loan of 600
mln ECUs from the European Community for transport system
modernisation, Deputy Finance Minister Boris Skapin was quoted
by the official Tanjug news agency.
    The community has offered Yugoslavia only 380 mln ECUs, he
said. The loan is to help finance completion of Yugoslavia's
north-south motorway, railway modernisation and export-oriented
industrial projects.
    Skapin told reporters in Brussels yesterday the requested
loan accounted for only 10 pct of total funds needed for these
projects, Tanjug said.

said its offer of 4.20 N.Z. Dlrs per share for supermarket
group &lt;Progressive Enterprises Ltd> still stands, although
&lt;Rainbow Corp Ltd> said today it has 52 pct of Progressive.
    BIL said in a statement it will review events on a daily
basis.
    Rainbow announced earlier that it had increased its stake
in Progressive to 52 pct from 44 pct through the purchase of
9.4 mln shares at between 3.80 and 4.80 N.Z. Dlrs per share.
    BIL chief executive Paul Collins said: "All Rainbow has done
is to outlay a substantial amount of cash to purchase shares
from parties who presumably were supportive of the merger."
    Rainbow has proposed a merger with Progressive to form a
new company, &lt;Astral Pacific Corp Ltd>. Under the merger,
shareholders in both Progressive and Rainbow will be issued
shares in the new company on a one-for-one basis.
    "Quite simply, Rainbow should now bid for the balance of
Progressive Enterprises at 4.80 N.Z. Dlrs per share," Collins
said.

<TITLE>NORWAY OFFERS 11TH LICENCE ROUND OFFSHORE BLOCKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OSLO, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Norway has offered 10 new offshore blocks
to foreign and domestic applicants in the first phase of the
country's eleventh concession round, government officials said.
    Company shares in each of the licences proposed by the Oil
and Energy Ministry are not final. The ministry has given the
companies 10 days to accept or decline the proposed shares.
    French companies Ste Nationale Elf Aquitaine &lt;ELFP.PA> and
Total Cie Francaise des Petroles &lt;TPN.PA>, which were expected
to receive operatorships following France's agreement last
autumn to purchase gas from Norway's Troll field, were not
offered operatorships in this round, industry sources said.
    Three eleventh round blocks were awarded in the
Haltenbanken exploration tract off central Norway, including
the Smoerbukk West field where Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S
&lt;STAT.OL> (Statoil) was appointed operator.
    Statoil will share the licence with subsidiaries of U.S.
Oil companies Tenneco Inc &lt;TGT.N> and Texas Eastern Corp
&lt;TET.N> and the Italian oil company &lt;Agip SpA>'s Norwegian
subsidiary.
    E.I. Du Pont de Nemours &lt;DD.N> subsidiary Conoco Norway Inc
was named operator on Haltenbanken block 6406/8 and will share
the licence with Statoil.
    Norsk Hydro A/S &lt;NHY.OL> will operate nearby block 6407/10
with partners Statoil, Norsk Agip A/S, Royal Dutch/Shell
Group's &lt;RD.AS> A/S Norske Shell and &lt;Deminex> unit Deminex
(Norge) A/S.
    Statoil has been offered the operatorship on a new block in
the relatively unexplored Moere South exploration area south of
Haltenbanken, with A/S Norske Shell, Texas Eastern and
&lt;Petroleo Brasileiro SA> (Petrobras) also offered stakes in the
block.
    Norwegian companies landed operatorships on all six blocks
opened in the Barents Sea area off northern Norway. The blocks
were awarded in three licenses, each covering two blocks.
    Statoil will head exploration on blocks 7224/7 and 7224/8,
sharing the licence with Exxon Corp's &lt;XON.N> Norwegian
subsidiary Esso Norge A/S, The British Petroleum Co PLC's
&lt;BP.L> BP Petroleum Development (Norway) Ltd, Shell, Norsk
Hydro and Saga Petroleum A/S &lt;SAGP.OL>.
    Blocks 7219/9 and 7220/7 were awarded to Norsk Hydro, the
operator, Statoil, Mobil Corp's &lt;MOB.N> Mobil Exploration

<TITLE>INSPECTORATE ISSUES 200 MLN MARK EQUITY EUROBOND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>A unit of Inspectorate International
AG &lt;INSZ.Z> is raising 200 mln marks through an equity warrant
eurobond package with a two pct coupon priced at par, lead
manager Schweizerische Bankverein (Deutschland) AG said.
    The five-year bond, for Inspectorate International Finance
NV, gives investors options on two separate warrant series "A"
and "B" exercisable into participation certificates in parent and
guarantor Inspectorate International AG.
    The first "A" series carries warrants for four participation
certificates. Upon exercising the "A" warrants, investors also
get two warrants for the "B" series.
    The "A" exercise period runs from May 7, 1987, to August 6,
1987. The exercise price is 543 Swiss francs.
    Of the two "B" warrants, one entitles investors to purchase
one participation certificate in Inspectorate International AG
and the other provides seven warrants.
    Investors may pay for "B" participation certificates by
redeeming the bond issued today. In this case, the bond, issued
in denominations of 5,000 marks, will be valued at a fixed
price of 4,200 Swiss francs, or 119.05 francs per 100 marks.
    Participation certificates acquired with "B" warrants will be
priced at 597 francs, equalling the price of the first tranche,
plus a 10 pct premium. The exercise period for the "B" series is
from August 8, 1987 to May 5, 1991.
    Fees for the bond total 2-1/4 pct, with 1-1/2 points for
selling, and 1-3/4 for management and underwriting combined.
    Investors will pay for the bond on April 8, and the bond
pays annual interest on the same day. It matures on April 8,
1992. The bond and warrants will be listed in Frankfurt.
    If all participation share warrants are exercised, the
company will obtain some 300 mln marks in new equity.
    The construction allows Inspectorate to borrow at lower
cost than a comparable convertible bond and will give the
Inspectorate equity through issues of participation
certificates in West Germany, a Swiss Bank Corp spokesman said.
    Inspectorate requires funding to finance its purchase of a
51 pct stake in Harpener AG, a diversified West German group,
and other recent acquisitions.

<TITLE>REUTERS TO BUY I P SHARP OF CANADA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Reuters Holdings Plc &lt;RTRS.L> said it
had agreed in principle to buy &lt;I P Sharp Associates Ltd> of
Toronto for 30.4 mln stg.
    Sharp is a time-sharing network and database company
specialising in finance, economics, energy and aviation. It
operates a global packet-switching network and global limits
systems for foreign exchange trading.
    Sharp shareholders will be offered cash, shares or a
mixture of the two in settlement. The acquisition, which is
subject to Canadian government approval, would be through
amalgamation into a specially-created company.
    Reuters said it had been given options by a number of Sharp
shareholders covering 67 pct of the common stock pending
completion of a Reuters review of the company.
    Sharp operates 38 offices in 20 countries. In 1986 it
reported revenue of 55 mln Canadian dlrs with a pretax loss of
1.6 mln compared with a 1.9 mln profit in 1985.
    However, Sharp said that internal accounts showed the
company was in profit in the first two months of 1987.
    End-1986 net assets totalled 11.85 mln dlrs.
    A Reuters statement said the acquisition would fit
perfectly into its package for the banking and securities
industries.

<TITLE>THATCHER DEFENDS UK OIL POLICY IN SAUDI INTERVIEW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JEDDAH, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
denied in an interview published in Saudi Arabia today that her
government's oil policy contributed to weakness in world oil
prices.
    She said the government was determined not to intervene to
influence production decisions by oil companies operating in
the North Sea.
    "We believe these must be a matter for the commercial
judgment of the oil companies," she told the Arabic language
daily al-Sharq al-Awsat in an interview coinciding with a visit
to London by King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.
    Thatcher said this policy had not contributed to the fall
in oil prices as North Sea production was now about the same as
in 1984 when prices were close to 30 dlrs a barrel.
    British production was on a plateau and was unlikely to
increase in the future, she said.
    "We naturally share the concern of Saudi Arabia and other
OPEC members about the harmful effects of oil market volatility
for both producer and consumer countries," Thatcher said.
    "On our part, we are careful to avoid any actions which
might add to such volatility."

<TITLE>BUNDESBANK BUYS DOLLARS IN FRANKFURT - DEALERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bundesbank bought large amounts
of dollars for yen in an apparent attempt to hold the dollar
above 149 yen, dealers said.
    The dollar intervention was in concert with some other
central banks, they said.
    Dealers said the Bank of Japan and Bank of England
supported the dollar against the yen earlier today and that
these two banks and the U.S. Federal Reserve were also active
yesterday.
    The Bundesbank declined to comment on the dealers' remarks.
    Dealers said the intervention underlined the determination
of central banks to keep currencies within recent ranges
following last month's agreement in Paris by six leading
countries to foster currency stability.
    One dealer said he had been repeatedly in contact with the
Bundesbank during the morning to see if it wanted to buy
dollars after the Japanese and U.K. Central bank moves.
    He said the Bundesbank told him it was observing the
situation to see if it should intervene in consultation with
other central banks.
    Since the Paris agreement on February 22 the dollar had
until yesterday traded in a 1.8150-1.8700 mark range, and above
150 yen, with traders reluctant to push the dollar down to test
central banks' resolve to defend currency stability.
    But the test came this week with the dollar falling below
1.81 marks and 150 yen. Dealers said a reviving trade dispute
between Washington and Tokyo and growing sentiment that the
dollar would have to fall further to narrow the obstinate U.S.
Trade deficit were behind the weakness.
    This week's intervention showed central banks were prepared
to cooperate to defend the Paris pact, dealers said.
    Dealers said it was significant the West German and British
central banks were supporting the dollar against the yen.
    That showed the pact involved multilateral cooperation by
central banks to foster currency stability, they said.
    But it was unclear how such cooperation was being arranged
and how frequent consultations between central banks were.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>CrossLand Savings FSB said it has
acquired Western Savings and Loand Co with the assistance of
the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
    CrossLand said Salt Lake City based Western has been
combined with its two Florida-based thrift subsidiaries. The
parent company contributed 50 mln dlrs in cash to the resulting
1.7 billion dlr asset subsidiary which will operate under the
name CrossLand Savings FSB with headquarters in Salt Lake City.
    CrossLand said Western, with assets of 400 mln dlrs,
operated 13 branch offices in the states of California, Oregon,
Utah and Washington.
    To facilitate the acquisition, CrossLand said, Western was
converted from a mutual to a stock association in a voluntary
supervisory conversion. Crossland and the FSLIC executived an
assistance agreement indemnifying CrossLand from certain losses
that could occur in connection with Western's loan portfolio.
    The company said James J. Heagerty, chairman and chief
executive officer of CrossLand Savings FSLA in Bradenton, Fla.,
will serve in that capacity for the new subsidiary resulting
from the merger.
    Western's president, Christopher J. Sumner, will be
president of the combined unit, CrossLand said.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>A total 59,000 tonnes of current series
white sugar received export rebates of a maximum 45.678
European Currency Units (Ecus) per 100 kilos at today's
European Community (EC) tender, the U.K. Intervention Board
said.
    Out of this, traders in West Germany received 34,750
tonnes, in the U.K. 13,000, in Denmark 7,250 and in France
4,000 tonnes, it added.
    Earlier today, London traders had expected the subsidy for
the current season whites campaign for licences to end-Aug to
be more than 45.00 Ecus per 100 kilos but Paris traders were
more precise by forecasting a rebate level of 45.75 to 46.0
Ecus.
    London traders were also reluctant earlier to predict the
likely tonnage to be authorised for export in view of the
on-going dispute between the Commission and European producers
over the threatened action by the producers to move over
800,000 tonnes to intervention.
    Last week saw 60,500 tonnes whites athuorised for export at
a maximum rebate of 44.819 Ecus per 100 kilos.

<TITLE>SOUTH AFRICA PROBLEMS REMAIN DESPITE DEBT PACT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Robert Ricci, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    JOHANNESBURG, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Africa's new foreign debt
agreement sparked a rally in local financial markets, but
bankers and economists said the pact only removes one source of
anxiety from a still depressed economy.
    "We have not gone from "no confidence" to "full confidence" yet,"
commented one banker, who saw the agreement as having marginal
influence on fundamental economic problems.
    Money market analysts cited the debt renegotiation as the
main impetus behind increases today in both the commercial and
financial rand.
    The commercial rand, used for current account transactions,
rose 0.5 cts to 49 U.S. Cts while the financial rand jumped
nearly two cts to 33 U.S. Cts.
    All equity and fixed investment flows of foreigners take
place through the financial rand, which is considered the main
barometer of South Africa's attractiveness to overseas
investors.
    Analysts predicted the debt arrangement plus further gains
in the gold price could push the commercial rand over 50 U.S.
Cts and the financial rand to 35 cents in the next few weeks.
    They said the financial rand in particular was being driven
by a tentative provision in the new debt agreement that could
favourably affect the currency.
    Foreign creditors may get permission to convert loan
balances and short-term claims into equity investments in South
Africa.
    Finance Minister Barend du Plessis said the Reserve Bank
was "investigating the implications of such conversions in light
of terms and restrictions of the financial rand system."
    Du Plessis in disclosing the new agreement last night said
the recent sharp rise in the financial rand was an example that
"some foreign investors are again taking a more realistic view
of South Africa."
    Terms of the debt agreement call for South Africa to repay
1.42 billion dlrs of 13 billion dlrs of frozen debt over the
next three years. The agreement extends a standstill
arrangement, expiring June 30, that has been in place since
August, 1985.
    Bankers said the repayment amounts essentially confirmed
their private estimates and could be comfortably met by the
monetary authorities.
    "They (creditors) asked for the maximum amount and we
offered the minimum," said one banking source, reacting to
reports from London that creditors were hoping for larger
repayments.
    Reserve Bank governor Gerhard de Kock said South Africa
should have "no difficulty whatsoever" with the terms.
    Economists said the debt agreement would have no
significant impact on economic problems continuing to face
South Africa including high rates of inflation and
unemployment, labour unrest and political uncertainty.
    Johannesburg Stock Exchange president Tony Norton, speaking
yesterday before the debt agreement, said the economy was "in
bad shape" and there was "an awful lot of talk but little action"
to cure serious problems.

<TITLE>KEY U.S. HOUSE PANEL FINISHES MAJOR TRADE BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>The House Ways and Means Committee
completed action on legislation to toughen U.S. trade laws,
chairman Dan Rostenkowski said.
    The committee's consideration of one of the most
controversial provisions, a plan to force major trade surplus
countries to cut their trade imbalance with the United States,
was deferred until the full House considers the trade bill, its
sponsor Rep. Richard Gephardt said.
    Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, told Reuters he was not
certain the exact form his trade surplus reduction proposal
would take. Last year the House approved his plan to force a 10
pct surplus cutback each year for four years, by countries such
as Japan.
    The Ways and Means Committess' trade bill forces President
Reagan to retaliate against unfair trade practices that violate
international trade agreements but it allows him to wave
retaliatory tariffs or quotas if the action would hurt the U.S.
economy.
    The trade bill gives U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter more authority in trade negotiations and in decisions
to grant domestic industries import relief.
    It also gives him authority to decide whether foreign trade
practices are unfair and violate U.S. trading rights. These
powers are currently held by President Reagan.
    The administration has strongly objected to this transfer
of authority from Reagan to Yeutter.
    The bill also extends U.S. authority to negotiate
multilateral trade agreements. The bill will be wrapped into
other trade legislation and voted on in the House in April.

<TITLE>SOVIET PAPER DETAILS GEORGIAN FLOOD DAMAGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MOSCOW, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Floods and avalanches killed 110 people
and caused around 350 mln roubles worth of damage in the
southern Soviet republic of Georgia earlier this year, the
government daily Izvestia said.
    Some 80,000 hectares of agricultural land and gardens had
been inundated, damaging tea plantations and orange groves, the
newspaper said. It added that spring sowing in southern parts
of the country was some two weeks behind schedule because of
the late thaw but gave no precise crop estimates.
    In the most detailed report to date on the heavy snows in
January and floods in February, Izvestia said 8,200 people had
been evacuated from mountain areas, 4,500 houses had been
damaged and hundreds of kilometres of roads and power lines had
been destroyed.
    A separate article in the daily warned that a sudden thaw
was expected shortly in the Ukraine and southern parts of
Russia, which experienced record snows this winter.
    Preventive measures have already been taken in some areas
including the evacuation of cattle.

<TITLE>UTILICORP &lt;UCU> SEES HIGHER 1987 FIRST QUARTER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAN FRANCISCO, CALIF., March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Utilicorp United Corp
said it expects to report 1987 first quarter earnings of about
12 mln dlrs or about 1.12 dlrs a share and revenues of about
190 mln dlrs.
    In the comparable quarter a year ago, Utilicorp earned 8.5
mln dlrs or 87 cts on revenues of 203 mln dlrs.
    There are 9.6 mln shares outstanding this year, up from the
8.5 mln shares in 1986, Utilicorp's president Richard Green
told financial analysts here.
    First quarter 1987 results include one month contribution
of West Virginia Power, which became a division on March 1,
1987, Green said in remarks prepared for delivery to analysts.
    Higher earnings for the period reflected reduced operating
and maintenenace expenses and about 10 mln dlrs in rate
increases in Iowa, Minnesota, Kansas and Colorado, he said.
    However, Utilicorp's Missouri Public Service division is
experiencing the effect of a 5.9 pct rate reduction authorized
in September 1986, he noted.
    Of Utilicorp's total revenues expected for the 1987 first
quarter, about 43 mln dlrs will be derived from electric
operations and about 147 mln dlrs will come from gas
operations, he said.
    Operating income derived from electric operations in the
first three months of 1987 is estimated to be eight mln dlrs,
while the contribution from gas operations will be about 10 mln
dlrs, Green said.
    Green told analysts that Utilicorp received regulatory
approval from various states and the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission to reincorporate in Delaware, effective April one.
    Utilicorp signed an agreement with Cominco Ltd of Vancouver
to extend the deadline to May 31, 1987, for completion of the
company's purchase of West Kootenay Power and Light of British
Columbia, due to a longer than expected regulatory approval
process, he said.
    Hearings were completed in February and a decision by the
British Columbia Utilities Commission on the 60 mln dlrs
purchase by Utilicorp is pending, he said.

expects first quarter 1987 sales to exceed total sales for the

to grow at a faster rate than sales.
    Tseng posted total revenues for 1986 of 4,255,731, and net
income of 258,125, or 14 cts per share.
    Jack Tseng, president of the company, attributed the high
expectations to increased orders from major costomers, as well
as accelerated business from its growing reseller network.
    Tseng posted first quarter 1986 sales of 549,950, and net
income of 19,163, the company said.

<TITLE>SOUTH AFRICA PROBLEMS REMAIN DESPITE DEBT PACT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Robert Ricci, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    JOHANNESBURG, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Africa's new foreign debt
agreement sparked a rally in local financial markets, but
bankers and economists said the pact removes only one source of
anxiety from a still depressed economy.
    "We have not gone from 'no confidence' to 'full confidence'
yet," commented one banker, who saw the agreement as having
marginal influence on fundamental economic problems.
    Money market analysts cited the debt renegotiation as the
main impetus behind increases today in both the commercial and
financial rand.
    The commercial rand, used for current account transactions,
rose 0.5 cts to 49 U.S. Cts while the financial rand jumped
nearly two cts to 33 U.S. Cts.
    All equity and fixed investment flows of foreigners take
place through the financial rand, which is considered the main
barometer of South Africa's attractiveness to overseas
investors.
    Analysts predicted the debt arrangement plus further gains
in the gold price could push the commercial rand over 50 U.S.
Cts and the financial rand to 35 cents in the next few weeks.
    They said the financial rand in particular was being driven
by a tentative provision in the new debt agreement that could
favorably affect the currency.
    Foreign creditors may get permission to convert loan
balances and short-term claims into equity investments in South
Africa.
    Finance Minister Barend du Plessis said the Reserve Bank
was "investigating the implications of such conversions in light
of terms and restrictions of the financial rand system."
    Du Plessis in disclosing the new agreement last night said
the recent sharp rise in the financial rand was an example that
"some foreign investors are again taking a more realistic view
of South Africa."
    Terms of the debt agreement call for South Africa to repay
1.42 billion dlrs of 13 billion dlrs of frozen debt over the
next three years. The agreement extends a standstill
arrangement, expiring June 30, that has been in place since
August, 1985.
    Bankers said the repayment amounts essentially confirmed
their private estimates and could be comfortably met by the
monetary authorities.
    "They (creditors) asked for the maximum amount and we
offered the minimum," said one banking source, reacting to
reports from London that creditors were hoping for larger
repayments.
    Reserve Bank governor Gerhard de Kock said South Africa
should have "no difficulty whatsoever" with the terms.
    Economists said the debt agreement would have no
significant impact on economic problems continuing to face
South Africa including high rates of inflation and
unemployment, labour unrest and political uncertainty.
    Johannesburg Stock Exchange president Tony Norton, speaking
yesterday before the debt agreement, said the economy was "in
bad shape" and there was "an awful lot of talk but little action"
to cure serious problems.

a joint venture exploration agreement with Degussa A.G., of
West Germany, regarding several North American platinum
properties.
    Conclusion of the agreement is subject to completion of
further detailed examination by Degussa, as well as board and
regulatory approvals.
    Under terms of the letter of intent, Degussa would
contribute substantially to a three year exploration budget of
4.5 mln dlrs in return for a 50 pct interest in the venture.
    Degussa's contribution to the exploration budget will be
based on it matching International Platinum's past exploration
and acquisition costs, estimated at about two mln dlrs, and
then contributing on a pro rata basis, International Platinum
said.
    Degussa's contribution would provide a major portion of
International Platinum's exploration budget, especially during
the first and second year of the proposed joint venture, the
company said.

<TITLE>IRAN SAYS HAS BETTER WEAPONS THAN SILKWORM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein
Mousavi said Iran had "more effective" missiles at its disposal
than the shore-to-sea missiles which had provoked U.S. Concern,
Tehran Radio reported.
    A U.S. State Department spokesman said last week Iran had
acquired Chinese-made Silkworm missiles which posed a greater
threat to shipping in the Gulf than the weapons previously
used.
    Tehran Radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp,
quoted Mousavi as saying that Tehran officially announced after
its forces overran southern Iraq's Faw peninsula in February
last year that it had shore-to-sea missiles.
    "The fact that the Americans, after so much delay, are now
thinking of expressing their concern with panic is because
Reagan needs this sensation now," said Mousavi, speaking after a
cabinet meeting in Tehran.
    "We also announce today that these missiles are not the
limit of our war capabilities in the Gulf," he added.
    Mousavi said the security of the Gulf region had nothing to
do with the U.S. But Iran would resort to any action to defend
the Gulf, "even those actions which are not thought probable by
Westerners."

    Sharp shareholders will be offered cash, shares or a
mixture of the two in settlement. The acquisition, which is
subject to Canadian government approval, would be through
amalgamation into a specially-created company.
    Reuters said it had been given options by a number of Sharp
shareholders covering 67 pct of the common stock pending
completion of a Reuters review of the company.
    Sharp operates 38 offices in 20 countries. In 1986 it
reported revenue of 55 mln Canadian dlrs with a pretax loss of
1.6 mln compared with a 1.9 mln profit in 1985.
    However, Sharp said that internal accounts showed the
company was in profit in the first two months of 1987.
    End-1986 net assets totalled 11.85 mln dlrs.
    A Reuters statement said the acquisition would fit
perfectly into its package for the banking and securities
industries.

<TITLE>FIAT MAY ISSUE BOND FOR LIBYAN STAKE, PAPER SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Fiat Spa &lt;FIAT.MI> is considering
issuing a eurobond of up to 384 mln dlrs, convertible or with
warrants attached for exercise into its shares still with banks
after the placement of the Libyan stake last autumn, the
financial daily Handelsblatt reported, quoting bourse sources.
    The newspaper gave no other details. But dealers said
shares of Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F> had been strong in recent
days, partly on hopes that the issue would allow the bank to
place its Fiat quota with investors at a reasonable price.
    Deutsche was lead underwriter for the 2.13 billion dlr Fiat
placement, announced on September 23.
    In Milan, a Fiat spokesman had no comment on the reports.
    A Deutsche Bank spokesman here said he had no knowledge of
a possible equity-linked Fiat bond. But German banking sources
said concern the bank had to take a hefty writedown for its
unplaced Fiat stock had weighed heavily on its share price.
    Milan share dealers also said Fiat stock had been under
pressure since the placement. Ordinary shares rose 20 lire to
12,880 today, but were well down from 16,600 on September 23.
    Sources close to Italian state-owned investment bank IMI
said earlier this month that a convertible issue was being
considered, but gave no details of the amount involved.

board increased its quarterly dividend on its common stock to
14 cts per share, from 12.5 cts per share the prior quarter.
    It said the dividend is payable May 1, 1987, to
shareholders of record April 15, 1987.
    In addition, the company said it authorized the repurchase
of up to an additional one mln shares of its common stock.
    On March 27, 1985, the board had authorized the repurchase
of up to two mln shares, as adjusted for a two-for-one split,
effected in April 1986, the company said.
    The company said 521,508 shares may still be repurchased
under the 1985 authorization. It added any shares repurchased
would be added to the treasury and will be available for future
issuance.
    The company said it has no present plans to issue any of
the shares which may be repurchased. The company said it
presently has 24,614,352 common shares outstanding.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Thai sugar production continued at a
high level in February, latest figures received by the
International Sugar Organization (ISO) show.
    The figures show stocks at end-February of 2.49 mln tonnes
raw value against 2.33 mln a year earlier. Analysts said this
was a new peak for the date.
    Production in February was 961,000 tonnes against 888,000
in February 1986 and took the Nov/Feb total for the current
crop to 2.25 mln tonnes. Production normally tails off sharply
after March, but in recent years production from March to the
end of the crop has been over 500,000 tonnes, analysts said.
    Thailand's exports in February were 32,800 tonnes and
consumption 57,800.
    Last month the Thai Agriculture Ministry said 1986/87
production was expected to fall to 2.3 mln tonnes from 2.48 mln
in 1985/86.

<TITLE>NY TRADERS EXPECT CHINA TO STEP UP SUGAR BUYING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Trade house sources said China is
expected to step up its sugar purchases following yesterday's
steep drop in world sugar prices.
    The consensus is that the Chinese will buy between 200,000
and 400,000 tonnes of raw sugar.
    "China is short of foreign exchange and a drop in prices is
usually taken as a buying opportunity by Peking," one trader
said.
    Yesterday, prices on the New York world sugar market
plummeted by 0.58 to 0.50 cent on heavy liquidation by
speculators, disenchanted over the market's lack of rallying
power.
    Speculation is that China will need the sugar for the
May/July period.

<DATELINE>    ROME, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Market response to the Treasury's 24,500
billion lire offer of short-term treasury bills was mixed, with
three-month paper in strong demand but six and 12-month bills
undersubscribed, Bank of Italy figures show.
    Rates were unchanged on those indicated at the time the
offer was announced.
    The market was assigned all of the 3,500 billion lire of
three-month bills on offer after requesting a total of 4,695
billion. Effective net annualised compound yield on the bills
is 9.87 pct, down from 9.98 pct on the previous issue of
three-month paper.
    Of the 9,500 billion lire of six-month paper offered,
operators requested and were assigned 7,098 billion lire at a
net annualised compound rate of 9.24 pct, down from 9.30 pct
previously.
    The market requested and was assigned 8,584 billion lire of
the 11,500 billion lire of 12-month bills offered at a net
annual rate of 9.02 pct, down from 9.05 pct previously.
    The Bank of Italy took up a total 4,200 billion lire of the
remaining six and 12-month paper, leaving 1,118 billion lire
unassigned.
    The bills replace maturing paper worth 23,442 billion lire,
of which 20,321 billion lire is in the hands of market
operators and the remainder with the Bank of Italy.

<TITLE>NAVISTAR &lt;NAV> STILL EXPECTS HIGHER 1987 NET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Navistar International Corp chairman
Donald Lennox repeated that benefits from recapitalization are
likely to boost future earnings for fiscal 1987.
    Lennox told the annual meeting that future quarterly and
full year earnings from ongoing operations should be
"significantly above 1986 results."
    In his remarks, Lennox said management has no plans to
recommend reinstatement of the company's common stock dividend
in the foreseeable future.
    He said the outlook for the medium duty truck market
continues to point to little or no change. But recent order
receipts indicate a "firmer tone in the heavy duty truck
segment," which could result in a five to eight pct increase in
industry shipments for the full year, he said.
    After restructuring under the holding company format, the
company's present truck and engine subsidiary will be known as
Navistar International Transportation Corp. Neil Springer
currently president and chief operating officer of Navistar
International was named chairman of the new subsidiary.
    James Cotting, now vice chairman and chief financial
officer, was named to succeed Lennox as chairman and chief
executive officer of Navistar International Corp. Lennox will
retire March 31.
    Shareholders at the meeting approved a change in the
company's structure to a holding company format, to be
effective April 1.

<TITLE>U.S. SENATE PANEL APPROVES TRADE MISSION BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Senate Agriculture
Committee approved a bill that would establish farm trade and
aid missions to promote the use of U.S. food aid, donation,
credit and export subsidy programs by overseas customers.
    The bill, approved by voice vote, would establish trade
missions made up of representatives of the Departments of
Agriculture and State, the Agency for International
Development, the Overseas Private Investment Corp, market
development cooperatives and private voluntary organizations.
    At least 16 missions would have to be sent within one year
after enactment of the bill. The missions would promote U.S.
programs, including PL480, Section 416 donations, Export
Enhancement Program, the dairy export incentive program, and
export credit guarantee programs (GSM-102, GSM-103).
    The panel agreed to drop a provision in the original bill,
offered by Sen. John Melcher (D-Mont.), that would have
required the U.S. Agriculture Department to donate at least one
mln tonnes of surplus commodities to developing countries.
    Current law requires USDA to donate at least 750,000 tonnes
of surplus grains and dairy products under the Section 416 food
donation program.
    The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the proposed
increase in the minimum tonnage requirement would have cost up
to 50 mln dlrs per year, Senate staff said.
    The committee also dropped a provision identifying which
countries would be the focus of the trade missions' activities.
    Under the bill adopted by the committee, countries "friendly
to the United States" would be eligible to host the trade
missions.
    Melcher originally had proposed sending missions to Mexico,
the Philippines, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Senegal, Nigeria, Peru,
Kenya, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Malaysia, Venezuela,
Tunisia and Morocco.
    The bill also would require the Foreign Agricultural
Service, FAS, to have at least 850 full-time employees during
fiscal years 1987-89. As of February 28, FAS had 790 full-time
employees, a FAS spokesman said.

    Stock market analysts said today's generally weak stock
market plus unwinding of positions after heavy buying of BAT
shares in the run-up to the results caused the fall in the
share price.
    "In the current market, people almost expect companies to
beat expectations," said one analyst, adding that pretax profits
of 1.35 to 1.40 billion stg had been forecast.
    BAT's 1986 figure of 1.39 billion stg compared with a 1985
pretax profit of 1.17 billion.
    Brokers noted that BAT's shift away from its
underperforming industries and the decreasing share of the
tobacco portion of the group were seen as good signs.
    BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy told a news conference that the
tobacco sector of the company had declined to 50 pct from 74
pct four years ago.
    Sheehy said he could see the tobacco portion of the company
declining further as other sectors increased in importance.
    He said BAT was looking to expand in the area of financial
services, in particular in the U.S.
    Sheehy also said the group had "no sizeable acquisitions" in
sight in the near future.
    Analysts said BAT's increasingly good performance in the
U.K. Insurance area was encouraging.
    Its declining debt-to-equity ratio of currently about 16
pct also made it likely that BAT would soon be looking to make
major acquisitions, they said.

<TITLE>BALDRIGE SAYS JAPAN MUST OPEN ITS MARKETS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige
said the United States will not stand idly by and let Japan
dominate the world electronics market.
    Baldrige told the Senate Finance Committee the United
States would insist Japan open its markets to U.S. products as
the U.S. market is open to Japanese products.
    Asked after his testimony if this meant the United States
would close its markets to Japan if they did not open theirs,
Baldrige said, "I'm not prepared to say that, but it certainly
would be one of the alternatives studied."
    Baldrige said in his testimony Japan had a closed
supercomputer market and a restricted telecommunications
market.
    "I can only conclude that the common objective of the
Japanese government and industry is to dominate the world
electronics market. Given the importance of this market to U.S.
industry in general and our defense base in particular, we
cannot stand by idly," he said.
    He said it was these concerns about national security which
led him to express reservations over the proposed acquisition
of Fairchild Semiconductor by Fujitsu of Japan.

proposed several ways to boost U.S. oil production, but he said
all would cost the Treasury money and will come under close
White House scrutiny before action is taken.
    One measure he said he favored would raise the depletion
allowance to 27.5 pct on new oil and gas production as well as
production using enhanced extraction methods.
    Herrington said such a plan would cost 200 mln dlrs a year.
The White House, reacting, said it did not favor amending the
tax code, but would look at the proposal.
    Herrington's proposals to spur production were made along
with the release last week of the energy department's report on
energy and the national security.
    The report said U.S. oil imports, rapidly rising, could hit
50 pct by the mid 1990s and have potentially damaging
implications for national security.
    He has said since in speeches and at news conferences that
any plan he would back to spur lagging domestic oil production
would have to meet three criteria--increase production, not
cause economic dislocation, and be low cost to the taxpayer.
    Herrington said an import fee would meet the first test,
spurring production but fail the second and third.
    He said it would raise production and return 120,000 oil 
workers to their jobs, but at the same time it lifted oil
prices, the higher prices would cost 400,000 jobs nationwide
and cut the gross national product by 32 billion dlrs.
    A tax on gasoline, he said, would fail the first criteria
by not increasing domestic production.
    In any case, U.S. officials say, President Reagan remains
firmly opposed to an import fee and a gasoline tax.
    Options which meet Herrington's criteria include:
    - Loan-price guarantees to shield banks from defaults by
borrowers because of lower oil prices. It was estimated that if
oil fell to five dlrs a barrel it could trigger defaults that
could cost the government an estimated 15 billion dlrs.
    - A five pct tax credit for exploration and development. It
would raise oil and gas production the equivalent of 325,000
barrels a day, at a cost of 740 mln dlrs a year.
    - A five pct credit only for geological and geophysical
expenditures. It would increase production by 80,000 barrels a
day, at a cost of 65 mln dlrs.
    - Lower bid minimums on outer continental shelf acreage to
spur exploration. A drop from the present 150 dlrs per acre for
the typical 5,760 acre tract to 25 dlrs per acre would lower
the cost of the standard tract lease to 144,000 dlrs.
    Herrington also pressed anew for existing Administration
proposals to deregulate natural gas, which he said would cut
the need for imported oil by 300,000 barrels daily.
    He also called again for Congressional approval to explore
off the continental shelf, which may hold more than 12 billion
barrels of oil, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which
may hold nine billion barrels.
    Herrington said he understood the Reagan's reluctance to 
amend the newly enacted tax code to fund some of these
proposals, but added he hoped his department's energy/security
study would make a strong case for the need to help the
struggling domestic oil industry.
    Another move Herrington said he will press anew, even
though it had been rejected earlier by the White House, is to
raise the fill-rate for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to
100,000 barrels a day from its planned 1988 rate of 35,000.
    This, he said, would further bolster national security in
case of an oil-supply disruption.

<TITLE>TODD SHIPYARDS &lt;TOD> OMITS COMMMON DIVIDEND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JERSEY CITY, N.J., March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Todd Shipyards Corp said it
omitted payment of the quarterly dividend on its common stock
and lowered the dividend on its series A preferred stock to 75
cts from 77 cts a share.
    Todd said the 75 ct preferred dividend will be paid May one
to shareholders of record April 15.
    The company said it omitted the common dividend to cover
both losses from a commercial ship conversion contract and
increased reserves for previously announced discontinued
shipyard operations.
    In addition, the company said its lenders agreed to
temporarily reduce the net worth requirement of its revolving
credit and term-loan pact to 140 mln dlrs from 130 mln.
    The reduction will hold through May 15, it said.
    Todd said the reduction in the net worth requirement
allowed for the payment of the preferred dividend and prevented
it from violating covenants of its credit agreement.
    The company said it is also negotiating with its lenders to
extend the reduced net worth terms beyond May 15.
    Todd added that it has suffered financially because of the
U.S. Navy's unwillingness to release certain retentions under
completed ship construction contracts and a general decrease in
U.S. military spending.

    The spokesman said the Fed intends to purchase bills

<TITLE>CANADA SETS OIL INDUSTRY AID PACKAGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    EDMONTON, Alberta, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canada's federal government
will provide a 350 mln dlr oil industry aid package that
includes cash incentives designed to cover one-third of a
company's oil and gas exploration and development costs, Energy
Minister Marcel Masse announced.
    The aid program will inject about 350 mln dlrs a year into
the oil and gas industry and could lead to more than one
billion dlrs in new investment, Masse told a news conference.
    The program will affect drilling done anywhere in Canada on
or after April 1, 1987.
    Masse told reporters that the government's oil industry aid
package is aimed at small and medium sized companies.
    The aid package, called the Canadian Exploration and
Development Incentive Program, will restrict the total payments
that any individual company can claim to 10 mln dlrs a year.
    Masse said the program will probably generate new
employment equivalent to 20,000 people working for a year.
    He said oil industry aid is needed because exploration and
development spending dropped by at least 50 pct since world oil
prices fell during the first half of 1986.
    Energy Minister Masse said the federal government decided
to provide cash incentives so a large number of non-tax paying
companies, mainly small Canadian firms, will receive the full
value of the incentive. Such companies would not immediately
benefit from tax benefits, he said.
    The federal government also wanted to deliver an aid
program outside the tax system. Finance Minister Michael Wilson
is now reviewing Canada's tax system and plans to announce tax
reform proposals later this spring.
    An important feature of the aid program is a decision to
let companies issue flow-through shares, allowing investors to
benefit from the subsidy rather than restricting benefits to
only participating companies, he said.
    Allowing flow-through shares under the program will make it
easier for companies to attract investors in exploration and
development, Masse said.
    He told reporters his department is still considering
whether to allow partnerships and other entities to qualify for
the subsidy.

facility, Union Bank of Switzerland (London branch) said.
    The revolving, evergreen facility will be completely

paper through a tender panel.
    There will be a cap of 50 basis points over the London
Interbank Offered Rate (Libor)on any drawings for advances and
a 50 basis points commission on acceptances. There will be a
facility fee of 3/16 pct.
    Banks are being invited to join at 20 to 25 mln stg for
12-1/2 basis points, at 10 to 15 mln stg for 10 basis points
and at five to 7.5 mln stg for 7.5 basis points.
    The facility, which can only be cancelled after
underwriters provide 61 months notice to the borrower, will
refinance some of Mountleigh's existing debt.

talks on buffer stock rules have slowed during a crucial phase
of negotiations, delegates said, but they remained confident
about prospects for reaching agreement by Friday.
    Cocoa producers, European Community (EC) consumers and all
consumers separately reviewed technical details of a buffer
stock rules package distributed yesterday.
    The buffer stock working group of consumers and producers
was set to meet later today to debate the proposal jointly for
the first time, they said.
    Delegates said major sticking points were likely to be the
amount of non-member cocoa allowed to be bought for the buffer
stock, and the fixed price differentials at which different
origin cocoas will be offered to the buffer stock manager.
    Producers would prefer that non-member cocoa not be
included in the buffer stock because, if it is, countries such
as Malaysia benefit from the cocoa agreement without joining
it, the delegates said.

<TITLE>BRAZIL PLANS NEW ECONOMIC STRATEGY FOR GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRASILIA, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil is preparing a new economic
strategy intended to protect domestic growth, Finance Ministry
sources said.
    A presidential spokesman said President Jose Sarney had
authorised the government's economic team to prepare the new
plan as soon as possible.
    Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said last night the plan
would reflect "an important battle to protect the country's
development and keep it from recession."
    Funaro, who helped lead the anti-inflation Cruzado Plan
launched in February 1986, has come under increasing attack
over the past few days following the resignation of Planning
Minister Joao Sayad on March 17. Observers say the plan has
failed to stabilise the country's economy.
    Sayad submitted a new package calling for a 90-day prices
and a wage freeze, but met opposition from Sarney and Funaro.
    Foreign Ministry sources said the new strategy was being
prepared by economists Persio Arida and Andre Lara Resende,
both former Central Bank officials said to have played leading
roles in the Cruzado Plan.
   The new plan will define the terms on which Brazil will seek
rescheduling of its 109 billion dlr foreign debt.
    On February 20, Brazil suspended servicing of 70 billion
dlrs of debt to private foreign banks.
    Funaro said last night Brazil wants a rescheduling program
spread over four years, and added that it had to include new
loans to keep the domestic economy growing.
    "In the past two years Brazil paid 24 billion dlrs in
servicing of its foreign debt, while only getting two billion
dlrs in new loans," Funaro said.

<TITLE>MIDDLE SOUTH &lt;MSU> TO FORM NEW DIVIDEND POLICY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Middle South Utilities Inc is taking a
conversative approach to formulating a new common stock
dividend policy, chairman Edwin Lupberger said.
    He told securities analysts that when the company's common
dividend is resumed, "the initial rate will appear conservative
to you by industry standards and in relation MSU's net income
and cash flow."
    "Our progress will determine how soon we can reinstate a
dividend to our common stockholders, he said."
    The company last paid a common dividend of 44.5 cts a share
in July 1985.
    Lupberger told the analysts that the company's primary
objective is "to create financial strength, enough strength so
that what happened to us and our stockholders over the past
couple of years never happens again."
    The company has faced regulatory challenges to rates
proposed to cover the cost of its Grand Gulf nuclear plant.
    He said Middle South's net income is expected to post
"modest growth" over the next three years.
    In 1986, the company earned 451.3 mln dlrs or 2.21 dlrs a
share on revenues of 3.49 billion dlrs.
    Lupberger said, "A good portion of the improvement
projected for the next three years comes from keeping the lid
on operating and maintenance expenses."

<TITLE>U.S. SUGAR POLICY MAY SELF-DESTRUCT, CONGRESSMAN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Greg McCune, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>A leading U.S. farm-state
Congressman, Jerry Huckaby, D-La., warned he will press next
year for legislation to control domestic production of
sweeteners, perhaps including corn sweeteners, if the industry
fails to voluntarily halt output increases this year.
    "We're moving toward a direction where we could
self-destruct (the U.S. sugar program)," Rep. Huckaby, chairman
of the House agriculture subcommittee dealing with sugar
issues, told Reuters in an interview.
    Huckaby, who told U.S. sugarbeet growers earlier this year
they must halt production increases, said he will deliver the
same message to Louisiana sugarcane growers Friday. He also
said he will soon talk with corn refiners on the subject.
    Huckaby said the campaign to urge a halt to domestic
sweetener output increases is an effort to forestall further
cuts in the sugar import quota, now at one mln short tons.
    "I think if we're talking about dropping (the quota)
another half mln tons, lets say, you're getting to the point
where the program might not work," he said.
    "Ideally, I'd like to freeze things right where we are,"
said Huckaby, leading advocate for sugar growers in Congress.
    A freeze would mean domestic sugar production at about the
current level of 6.5 mln tons, the corn sweetener share of the
U.S. market staying at just over 50 pct, and U.S sugar imports
holding at about 1.2 mln tons, Huckaby said.
    A decision on whether to seek legislation will not be made
until 1987 output numbers are known late this year, he said.
    "I feel like if we didn't expand production, we could
probably hold where we are indefinitely, or at least through
the 1985 farm bill without any changes (in the sugar program),"
Huckaby said.
    However, much depends on whether high-fructose corn syrup
producers continue to expand their share of the U.S. sweetener
market from just over 50 pct, Huckaby said.
    He noted most estimates are that corn sweeteners will
capture at most only another 10 pct of the sweetener market in
the U.S.
    But he said if there were an economic breakthrough in the
production of a new crystalline corn sweetener which further
expanded the corn sweetener share, then U.S. sugar imports
might be eliminated and U.S. sugar output severely reduced.
    Huckaby said he will deliver this message to corn refiner
companies such as A.E. Staley and Archer Daniels Midland soon.
    "This program is advantageous to the corn users. They have
some natural, legitimate self-interest in seeing that the
program is preserved," Huckaby said.
    Huckaby said he has asked sugar industry representatives to
think about how domestic output could be controlled, either
through production allocations, acreage or marketing controls.
    Huckaby also said he would be seeking guidance from the
Justice Department to determine if it would be legal to ask
corn refiners to limit production.
    "I don't know if we will go this route, but if we do
there's a question in my mind at this point in time; can you do
that legally?" he said.
    Asked if he would proceed with production controls without
the support of corn refiners, Huckaby said "You build a fragile
house if you do it that way."
    Huckaby said he understands why U.S. cane and beet farmers
have expanded production, because high sugar price support
means returns from sugar are higher than competing crops such
as soybeans and grain.
    But he said for sugar growers as a whole, expansion would
not be good policy.
    Huckaby said he has tried to stress, in his speeches to
sugar industry groups, that if growers continue to expand, they
may be penalized retroactively under any production control
legislation passed next year.
    Huckaby said Congress is unlikely to approve any changes in
the sugar program this year despite a Reagan administration
proposal to drastically slash the program.
    "The administration proposal is so drastic, that I don't
think it will get up a head of steam," Huckaby said.
    He said even a more moderate proposal to reduce sugar price
support is unlikely to be approved.
    Instead of seeking to slash the domestic sugar program,
Huckaby said the Reagan administration should file a complaint
with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade against the
European Community's sugar policy. He said EC policies are the
major cause of the depressed world sugar market.

<TITLE>BRAZILIAN LABOUR UNREST SPREADS, MANY BANKS SHUT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Stephen Powell, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SAO PAULO, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil's labour unrest is spreading,
with many banks, universities and government statistical
offices on strike and more pay disputes looming.
    Bankworkers' leaders said that a national strike launched
yesterday to press for a 100 pct immediate pay rise and monthly
salary adjustments had the support of most of the 700,000
workforce.
    The strike today closed the stock exchanges of Sao Paulo
and Rio de Janeiro.
    For the government the one positive development on the
labour front was the gradual return to work of the nation's
40,000 seamen, who began a national strike on February 27.
    A union spokesman in Rio de Janeiro told Reuters about half
the seamen had returned to work after accords with 22 companies
and that the strike looked close to an end.
    Otherwise the labour scene looked bleak, with the bank
strike posing the most serious problems for Brazil's
crisis-laden economy.
    "If this goes on for more than a few days it will have a
serious effect because normal financial operations will grind
to a halt," said a western diplomat in Sao Paulo.
    Today Brazil's 50,000 university teachers in the 42 federal
universities launched a national strike, with a broad political
demand as well as a pay claim.
    David Fleischer, head of the political science department
in Brasilia university, told Reuters the National Association
of Higher Education Teachers wanted a full congressional
inquiry into what had happened to government education funds.
    He said the universities were strapped for cash and that
the association suspected the junior partner in the coalition

    Hardly any sectors of the economy are proving immune to the
current labour unrest, caused by the return of high inflation,
officially pegged at 33 pct for January-February.
    Other possible strikes looming include stoppages by oil

<TITLE>ENCOR PLANS 125 MLN DLR DEBENTURE OFFERING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CALGARY, Alberta, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Encor Energy Corp Inc> said
it planned an issue in Canada of 125 mln dlrs of 6.75 pct
subordinated debentures, convertible any time into Encor common
shares for a price of 10 dlrs a share.
    Encor, 48 pct-owned by Dome Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP>, said
investment dealers McLeod Young Weir Ltd and Pemberton Houston
Willoughby Bell Gouinlock Inc agreed to purchase the issue for
resale to the public.
    It said the debentures would pay interest semi-annually and
be callable after five years at par plus accrued interest.
    Encor earlier reported a 1986 net loss of 406.6 mln dlrs.
    Encor last year earned 35.4 mln dlrs. The 1986 net loss
included a 545.7 mln dlr asset writedown before a 139.2 mln dlr
recovery of deferred taxes.
    The company said 1986 results were seriously affected by
lower oil and gas prices, but did not reflect its recent
acquisition of &lt;Aberford Resources Ltd>.
    It said that while oil prices had improved in early 1987,
it would remain cautious and base capital spending on
conservative price assumptions.
    Encor will use proceeds from the debenture offer to retire
bank debt incurred in the Aberford deal, it said.

<TITLE>TWA &lt;TWA> SELLS POSITION IN USAIR &lt;U></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Trans World Airlines Inc sold four mln
shares it held in USAir Group Inc, Wall Street sources said.
The sources said the buyers are believed to be a group of
institutions.
    Bear Stearns handled the trade. It crossed the four mln
shares at 45, off 1/8. Bear Stearns would not comment on buyers
or sellers.
    USAir and TWA had no immediate comment.
    USAir later said it did not buy the stock. A company
spokesman would not comment further.
    TWA earlier this month reported holding slightly more than
four mln shares, or about 15 pct of USAir. It had also proposed
a takeover of USAir, which at the time was negotiating its
proposed merger with Piedmont Aviation Inc.
    On March 16, TWA withdrew its bid, saying it did not intend
to seek control of USAir Group or to acquire more of its stock
at the time.
    TWA also said in the filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission that its chairman, Carl Icahn is the target
of an SEC probe of alleged violations of securities laws.
    In its filings with the SEC, TWA said it paid 178.2 mln
dlrs for its USAir stock.
    "With this out of the way, if it indeed was bought by
institutions, it paves the way for better value for USAir stock
later," said Janney Montgomery analyst Louis Marckesano of
TWA's sale of its stock.
    "Technically, as long as that block was overhanging the
market you didn't know what was going to happen," he said.
    USAir stock was trading at 44-3/8, off 3/4 on volume of 4.4
mln shares. TWA stock rose one to 28-1/4.

<TITLE>COMBUSTION ENGINEERING&lt;CSP> SEES 1ST QTR NET OFF</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STAMFORD, Conn., March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Combustion Engineering Inc said
it expects first quarter earnings to be 20 to 25 pct below the
year-ago 13.6 mln dlrs, mainly due to financing costs resulting
from the January 1987 acquisition of AccuRay Corp.
    The company said it has filed for an offering of four mln
common shares and 150 mln dlrs of subordinated debentures due
2017, with proceeds to be used to refinance the short-term bank
debt incurred for the AccuRay acquisition, to finance other
costs of the transaction and for general corporate purposes.
    Combustion said 3,500,000 shares will be sold in the U.S.
and the remainder overseas.
    Combustion paid about 218 mln dlrs for AccuRay, a maker of
computer-based measurement and control systems used in pulp and
paper mills.
    The company said it expects to release first quarter
results in the third week in April.
    Combustion said it expects further restructuring of core
businesses -- particularly Lummus Crest -- this year through
staff reductions downsizings and the consolidation of
facilities.
    Combustion said the restructuring at Lummus Crest is
expected to substantially reduce but not eliminate this year
losses in the Engineering and Construction segment.
    But it said improvement at Lummus Crest is expected to be
approximately offset by a number of factors, including a
somewhat lower level of earnings in the Power Generation
segment than in 1986, financing costs of the AccuRay
acquisition, costs associated with integrating AccuRay
technology and operations and delays in waste to energy
projects.

<TITLE>BELGIUM PLANS TO OUTLAW INSIDER TRADING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>A Belgian finance ministry spokesman
said new rules planned on insider trading would enable
offenders to be fined and imprisoned for up to a year, and be
compelled to forfeit gains.
    The new rules require parliamentary approval, and
government sources said it was unclear when they would come
into force. Insider trading is currently not an offence in this
country.
    The cabinet approved a separate bill that analysts said
includes provisions to make more difficult the build-up of
major new stakes in Belgian companies.
    The bill would make obligatory the declaration of major
stakes in companies quoted on the bourse with own resources of
more than 200 mln francs.
    The Minister for Economic Affairs would need to be informed
in advance of deals under which foreign interests planned to
buy a new stake of more than ten pct of the voting shares in a
large Belgian company, or to increase an existing stake to more
than 20 pct.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker said
that some of the trade bills proposed by Congress conflict
significantly with certain basic principles the Reagan
administration considers critical.
    Baker told a Senate committee that the administration would
resist such measures as a general import surcharge,
sector-specific protection such as import quotas for individual
products, mandatory retaliation, and limits on presidential
discretion in negotiating more open markets abroad and other
trade steps.

<TITLE>ARGENTINE SOYBEAN YIELD ESTIMATES DOWN FURTHER</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Manuel Villanueva, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BUENOS AIRES, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Argentine grain producers again
reduced their estimates for the total yield of the 1986/87
soybean crop, which will begin to be harvested in mid-April,
trade sources said.
    They said growers now forecast soybean production this
season at between 7.5 and 7.8 mln tonnes, down from last week's
estimate of 7.7 to eight mln tonnes and the 8.0 to 8.4 mln
tonnes forecast in mid-February.
    The new forecast is still higher than last season's record
total production.
    Private sources put 1985/86 production at a record 7.2 to
7.3 mln tonnes -- 4.2 to 6.4 pct lower than the new forecast
for the current crop. The official figure for 1985/86 is 7.1
mln tonnes, 5.6 to 9.9 pct below this season's new estimates.
    Growers in the past week discovered more empty soybean pods
in the main producing areas of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe
provinces and northern Buenos Aires.
    The crop since January has been hit by high temperatures
and inadequate rainfall. Growers fear they may find more empty
pods and have to further reduce their forecasts of total yield.
    The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 to
3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct higher than the 1985/86
record of 3.34 mln hectares.
    The state of the crop continued to be good in general until
last week but intense, heavy rains since could have caused
damage in areas where rainfall was higher than 100 mm.
    Where the rains were less heavy they were considered
beneficial although too late to improve yield estimates.
    The rains also benefitted maize and sorghum crops in
southern Buenos Aires province but are not expected to
influence production forecasts.
    In other areas, especially western Buenos Aires, where
rainfall was more than 200 mm, parts of the sunflower, maize
and sorghum crops not yet harvested may have been damaged.
    The coarse grain crop harvest was interrupted last week by
rains which also reached over 100 mm in parts of Cordoba, La
Pampa and Santa Fe and almost 90 mm in parts of Entre Rios.
    The area sown with maize this season was between 3.58 and
3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mln
hectares in 1985/86.
    The yield of 1986/87 maize continued to be forecast at
between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes.
    This estimate is 19.8 to 20.2 pct lower than the 12.4 to
12.6 mln tonnes at which private sources put 1985/86 production
and 21.1 to 22.7 pct lower than the official 12.8 mln tonnes.
    The sunflowerseed harvest has covered 23 to 26 pct of the
area sown and continues in parts of central Buenos Aires
although at a standstill elsewhere due to rain and floods.
    A resumption of full harvesting and assessment of damage is
impossible until rains stop and a spell of a week to 10 days of
sunshine dries the fields.
    The area sown this season was 2.0 to 2.2 mln hectares, down
29.9 to 36.3 pct on last year's record 3.14 mln hectares.
    Sunflowerseed 1986/87 production is still forecast at 2.3
to 2.6 mln tonnes, 34.1 to 41.5 pct below the 1985/86 record of
4.1 mln tonnes.
    The grain sorghum harvest was the least affected by the
rains, advancing steadily in Santa Fe and Cordoba and starting
in La Pampa to cover 14 to 16 pct of the total area sown.
    The area sown was 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2
pct less than the 1.45 mln hectares the previous season.
    Yield estimates remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes, 16.7 to
22 pct down on 1985/86 production of 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes.

<TITLE>TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS NEW MONEY NOT PANACEA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker said
that massive new lending to the debtor nations could actually
increase their difficulties in the period ahead without
protections.
    In testimony before a Senate committee, Baker said that
"throwing money at the debtor nations won't solve their
problems."
    He said it might seem like an easy solution to the debt
problems and might appear a simple way to boost U.S. exports
and growth in the debtor nations.
    Baker told the committee that such an approach could "worsen
their difficulties unless the new financing can be productively
absorbed and is consistent with their ability to grow and
service debt."
    He said that the debt initiative that bears his name is a
long-term approach and that further progress "will be gradual
and will vary among nations, depending upon their own
determination to implement growth-oriented reforms and the
continued active support of the international community."

<TITLE>CYCLOPS &lt;CYL> SAYS DIXONS APPOINTEES RESIGN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PITTSBURGH, Pa., March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cyclops Corp said the three
members of its board appointed last week by &lt;Dixons Group PLC>
had resigned and that it named three Cyclops executives to
replace them.
    Cyclops said the moves followed the announcement earlier
today by Dixons that it received only 20 pct of Cyclops
outstanding common stock under an extended tender offer that
expired yesterday.
    Dixons initially ended its 90.25 dlr a share tender offer
on March 17 after receiving 54 pct of Cyclops shares.
    However, the Securities and Exchange Commission last Friday
pressed Dixons to reopen the offer because the U.K.-based
company had dropped a condition that at least 80 pct of Cyclops
stock be tendered by the close of the offer.
    Dixons then extended the offer until yesterday and earlier
today indicated that a substantial number of tendered Cyclops
shares had been withdrawn, leaving it with only 852,000 shares,
or just over 20 pct of the roughly 4.26 mln Cyclops shares
outstanding.
    Dixons said today that it purchased the tendered shares,
which, when combined with the shares it already holds, gives it
a 21.7 pct stake in Cyclops.
    Cyclops said its reconstituted board includes the three
newly named directors and five outside directors, all of whom
were on the board prior to Dixons tender offer.
    The three Cyclops directors were replaced by Dixons
appointees on March 17 under an agreement reached between the
two companies.

<TITLE>U.S. SENATE TRADE LEADER CONCERNED ABOUT CANADA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>The chairman of the U.S. Senate
committee with jurisdiction over trade said he was concerned
about a resolution on bilateral trade negotiations adopted by
the Canadian House of Commons last week.
    The resolution supports negotiation of a bilateral trading
agreement with the United States while protecting Canadian
political sovereignty, social programs, agricultural marketing
systems, the auto industry and Canada's cultural identity.
    Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen said the
resolution may jeopardize the viability of the proposed free
trade agreement between the two countries, which are each
other's largest trading partners.
    "We need a truly free trade agreement, which means both
countries have to work toward a deal that is mutually
beneficial and comprehensive, a large agreement," the Texas
Democrat said in a statement.
    "I do not question Canada's right to protect its political
sovereignty or cultural identity. However, if these phrases
mean the government of Canada means to take important economic
issues off the table in these negotiations, I am deeply
concerned," he added.
    Bentsen said Canada restricts trade 15 different ways while
the United States uses only six trade restriction methods. He
said if Canada proposes an agreement where both countries get
rid of six methods of trade restriction, it would not be fair
and might not win Senate approval.
    "I am deeply concerned that when the President visits Prime
Minister (Brian) Mulroney next month, he will be presented with
this kind of argument, and I hope he makes it clear -- as I did
when I was in Canada -- that only a mutually beneficial
agreement will be successful," Bentsen said.
    Reagan and Mulroney are scheduled to meet April 5-6 in
Ottawa.
    Bentsen urged Mulroney to withdraw a proposal that would
ban imports of independently produced films into Canada by
non-Canadians, which the senator called a protectionist
measure.

rates around those levels."
    He referred to a February agreement by six leading
industrial nations to cooperate on monetary matters.
    Baker refused to answer a question whether Japan and
Germany had done enough to stimulate their domestic economies
for the United States to support the dollar.
    "I will not comment because the foreign exchange market
reads more or less than is intended in my statements," Baker
said.
    Baker said that the other signatories recognized that they
must carry their share of the load of correcting external
imbalances that have hindered the world's economy.
    He cited news reports that Germany would increase a
proposed tax cut for 1988 by about five billion marks to
stimulate domestic growth.
    Japan also agreed to consider stimulative measures after
the Japanese budget was made final.
    Baker said those nations were stimulating their economies
in a manner consistent with gains against inflation.

<TITLE>U.S. GOVERNMENT EXPANDS CRACKDOWN ON BAD DEBTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>The administration is expanding its
crackdown on bad debts, officials of the White House Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) told reporters.
    OMB Deputy Director Joseph Wright said the administration
this year plans to turn over to private credit rating firms
data on about 3.5 mln "deadbeats" who are seriously behind or in
default in their payments on federal loans.
    Next year, the government will turn over to private
collection bureaus four billion dlrs in bad education loans and
three billion dlrs in other bad government loans, Wright said.
    The government is also considering letting individuals make
payments on their student loans with credit cards, officials
told reporters.
    The Internal Revenue Service is already studying the use of
credit cards to pay income taxes, but this usage would require
a change in federal law while no congressional action would be
needed for credit cards to be used for student loans, the
officials said.
    The officials disclosed these plans in releasing the third
annual OMB report to Congress on management of the U.S.
government.
    The report details steps to be taken by the administration
to increase federal efficiency and to continue President
Reagan's highly publicized "war on waste, fraud and abuse."
    According to the report, elinquent U.S. debt had soared to
68.3 billion dlrs, or 18.8 pct of total receivables, by the end
of the fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30. At the end of
fiscal 1981, when Reagan took office, bad debt stood at 29.8
billion dlrs or 12.3 pct of total debt.
    But OMB officials said other Reagan administration efforts
had already saved taxpayers 84 billion dlrs and would save
another 25 billion dlrs or so by the time Reagan left office.

<TITLE>JOHN LABATT SEES GOOD FOURTH QUARTER, YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;John Labatt Ltd> anticipates a good
fourth quarter and a new peak in sales and earnings for the
fiscal year ending April 30, president Peter Widdrington told
financial analysts.
    He would not make any specific forecast, but said he was
optimistic for further growth in fiscal 1988 in the company's
brewing and food products operations.
    Labatt's earnings rose to 92.8 mln dlrs in the nine months
ended January 31 from year-earlier 78 mln dlrs. Revenue for the
nine months rose to 3.20 billion dlrs from 2.70 billion dlrs.
    Widdrington said Labatt's three-year business plan, now
being updated, targets total sales of about six billion dlrs,
including 2.50 billion dlrs in the U.S.
    Labatt, Canada's leading brewer, has expanded in the U.S.
food products industry by acquisitions.
    Widdrington said Labatt's strategy for U.S. expansion
stemmed partly from its strong market position in the Canadian
food and beverage industry. The U.S. share of revenues for this
year will be about 35 pct, rising to 40 pct in fiscal 1988, he
said.

<TITLE>FERC DECISION COULD CUT COLUMBIA GAS &lt;CG> NET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WILMINGTON, Del., March 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>Columbia Gas System Inc said a
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decision today on natural
gas cost recovery could reduce its 1987 earnings by about 1.25
dlrs a share.
    The company said "this could bring earnings for 1987 below
Columbia's stated goal of earning no less than its 3.18 dlrs
per share dividend." It earned 2.12 dlrs a share in 1986.
    It said management expects to recommend to the board that
the dividend rate be maintained in 1987.
    Columbia Gas said the impact of the FERC decision may be
offset by a one-time accounting change rleated to future tax
liabilities under the new federal tax laws.
    The company recorded these liabilities based on older,
higher tax rates, but an action being considered by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board could result in a gain of
about 1.20 dlrs a share in 1987, it explained.
    "Thus there is a good chance that we will attain our 1987
earnings goal -- although not in the way originally planned,"
Columbia Gas said.
    Columbia Gas said the FERC decision would limit the
recovery of certain gas contract costs by Columbia Gas
Transmission Corp, the company's principal pipeline subsidiary.
    It said the decision specifically excluded from a purchased
gas adjustment filing by the pipeline costs related to
amortizing payments made to producers to reform gas purchase
contracts. These were excluded on the grounds the subsidiary
failed to sufficiently support cost recovery.
    The company said its subsidiary is not precluded from
making a new filing to provide sufficient support.

<TITLE>CANADA MAY MONITOR STEEL SHIPMENTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canada may begin monitoring steel
flowing in and out of the country to determine if any steel is
being illegally "trans-shipped" to the U.S., senior government
trade officials said.
    The officials, asking not to be identified, said the
government will investigate an industry contention that steel 
imported from countries such as South Korea and Taiwan is being
diverted to the U.S. and ultimately exasperating concerns about
the level of Canadian exports south of the border.
    But the senior officials, asking not to be indentified,
said that despite intense pressure from the Reagan
Administration, Ottawa was not considering any kind of formal
limits on Canadian shipments to the U.S.
    "In a sense what I hope we are doing is buying some time,"
said one official who claimed Canadian companies were "fair
traders" in the big American market.
    If approved by the Canadian cabinet, the officials said a 
monitoring system will be established in the next three or four
months.
    "I guess if we find trans-shipment is a problem, we would
have to do something about it," said a trade official.
    Canadian steel shipments to the U.S. have risen to 5.7 pct
of the U.S. market in recent months, almost double the level
just two years ago.
    The increase in Canadian shipments comes at a time of
growing anger in the U.S. over rising steel imports from
several countries in the face of a decline among domestic steel
producers.
    Some U.S. lawmakers have proposed Canada's share of the
American market be limited to 2.4 per cent.
    The Ontario Government has urged Ottawa to require foreign
companies to obtain permits to import steel into the country.
Currently, import licences are required only for carbon or raw
steel, which makes up less than half the steel market.
    Canada exported two billion Canadian dlrs worth of steel in
1986, while importing 944-mln dlrs worth of the product in the
same year.

<TITLE>COCOA COUNCIL CHAIRMAN SEEKS BUFFER COMPROMISE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>International Cocoa Organization, ICCO,
Council chairman, Denis Bra Kanon, said he will attempt to
reach a compromise on buffer stock rules for the International
Cocoa Agreement.
    Bra Kanon called for bilateral consultations among
producers and consumers Thursday morning to resolve outstanding
differences on how much non-member cocoa the buffer stock can
purchase and differentials to be fixed for different origin
cocoa, consumer delegates told reporters.
    Bra Kanon is expected to meet with about eight delegations
individually in attempt to iron out remaining problems.
    Producers and consumers indicated support "in principle" for
the draft buffer stock rules package formulated over the past
week by a small working group, consumer delegates said.
    Despite remaining differences delegates remained confident
a buffer stock accord would be agreed to by Friday when the
council session ends, but certain technical points need further
clarification, the delegates said.
    Certain consumers are concerned that differentials included
in the draft buffer stock package are out of line with market
realities, consumer delegates said.
    Unless these are modified there are fears it would promote
purchases of quality cocoas, such as Ghana origin, which are
normally required by manufacturers, they said.
    Restrictions on buffer stock purchases of non-member cocoa
might lead to a supply overhang in Malaysian cocoa, which would
depress prices, they added.

<TITLE>SNC GROUP EXPECTS HIGHER 1987 EARNINGS, SALES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;SNC Group Inc> expects 1987 earnings
to rise to 1.20-1.40 dlrs a share from 91 cts a share last
year, with revenues climbing to about 430 mln dlrs from last
year's 350 mln dlrs, president Alex Taylor said before the
annual meeting.
    SNC, Canada's second biggest engineering and construction
group, became the country's largest ammunition manufacturer
last year with its 90 mln dlr acquisition of Canadian Arsenals
Ltd from the Canadian government.
    The impact of that and several smaller deals will be felt
fully in 1987, Taylor said.
    Defense preoducts and other manufacturing operations will
account for more than half SNC's total 1987 revenues, helping
to counterbalance the more cyclical engineering and
construction acivities, Taylor said.
    Last year, SNC earned 8.7 mln dlrs, including a small
extraordinary gain.
    In 1987, a total manufacturing activities will generate
about 235 mln dlrs in revenues, and engineering and
construction about 200 mln dlrs, he said, adding that defense
products operations should be a major contributor to earnings.

<TITLE>U.S. SECURITIES GROUP BACKS INSIDER RESTRAINTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Securities Industry Association
backed a variety of restraints on insider trading and hostile
corporate takeovers and asked Congress to define insider
trading in law.
    The industry trade association called on U.S. securities
firms to take steps to protect sensitive corporate secrets to
guard against illegal trading by employees.
    The association also backed broad federal restrictions on a
variety of tactics used in hostile corporate takeovers.
    But it said investment banking firms should be allowed to
continue to engage in both arbitrage and merger and acquisition
activities so long as those functions were kept separate.
    The SIA, in a report adopted yesterday by its board of
directors, backed a higher enforcement budget for the federal
Securities and Exchange Commission and called on U.S. stock
exchanges to beef up their supervision of member brokerages.
    The report said securities firms "should be more rigorous in
restricting sensitive information on a need-to-know basis."
    It said firms should train their employees to understand
the need for confidentiality of market-sensitive information.
    It said legislation to define insider trading should avoid
expanding current law in a way that would impede the market.
    It said an insider trading definition should exempt a
securities firm from liability for law violations by its
employees unless the firm had participated in or was aware of
the wrongdoing.
    In the mergers and acquisitions area, the association
advocated a ban on greenmail payments or poison pill takeover
protection plans without prior shareholder approval.
    It said a group or individual buying up a company's stock
should be required to file a public disclosure statement before
acquiring more than five pct of the company's shares. Under
current law, disclosure may be made as late as ten days after
exceeding the five pct limit.
    The association said all purchases exceeding 20 pct of a
company's voting stock shouls be made only through a tender
offer open to all shareholders. Under current law there is no
limit on open market purchases.
    The group said the federal government should preempt state
regulation of defensive takeover tactics.
    The group said all tender offers should remain open for at
least 30 calendar days.
    The current requirement is expressed in business days.
    It said so-called "lockup" devices, in which securities are
issued to a friendly investor to seal a takeover deal or fend
off an unfriendly predator should be limited to 18.5 pct of the
target company's total common stock.
    Association president Edward O'Brien said the group acted
out of concern over the ad hoc restructuring of corporate
America on Wall Street and investor fears about insider trading
and fairness in the marketplace.

<TITLE>TEXACO &lt;TX> RESERVES DOWN DESPITE LOWER OUTPUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Texaco Inc's oil and gas reserves
declined in 1986 despite reduced production and upward
revisions in the company's previous reserve estimates, its
annual report said.
    The statement of the report's auditor was qualified -- as
was the previous one -- because of the unkonwn final impact of
the judgement won by Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL> against Texaco on
charges Texaco interfered with Pannzoil's contract to acquire
Getty Oil Co.
    The auditor's point out, as Texaco has in the past, the
company's loss of any of several pending court decisions in
this case could cause it "to face prospects such as having to
seek protection of its assets and business pursuant to the
bankruptcy and reorganization provisions of Chapter 11" of the
federal bankruptcy code.
    Commenting on a Texas Court of Appeals ruling which reduced
Pennzoil's judgement by two billion dlrs, to 9.1 billion dlrs,
Texaco said it will file a motion for a rehearing by the
appeals court no later than March 30.
    Texaco said the proven crude oil reserves of the company
and its consolidated subsidiaries totaled 2.54 billion barrels
at the end of 1986, down from 2.69 billion a year earlier.
    However, inclusion of Texaco's equity in the Eastern
Hemisphere reserves of a nonsubsidiary company limited the
decline to 2.91 billion barrels from 3.00 billion at the end of
1985.
    Worldwide production by the consolidated subsidiaries
declined to 341 mln barrels last year from 362 mln in 1985 and
upward revisions in previous reserve estimates rose to 143 mln
barrels from 117 mln, respectively.
    Texaco said the largest drop in reserves came in the United
States -- where the total dropped to 1.46 billion barrels from
1.55 billion.
    The company said U.S. liquids production averaged 660,000
barrels per day last year, down from 714,000 in 1985, with
about 44 pct of the decline -- some 24,000 barrels per day --
representing high-cost production shut-in or curtailed in
response to the decline in crude oil prices during 1986.
    Texaco said its natural gas reserves totaled 8.16 trillion
cubic feet at year end, down from 8.87 trillion cubic feet at
the end of 1985.

<DATELINE>    NORTHBROOK, ILL., March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>International Minerals and
Chemical Corp said its board approved a 50 mln dlrs budget over
the next several years to build production facilities for a
newly developed product to be used to improve the lean weight
of hogs.
    The new product, porcine somatotropin (PST) is described as
a natural bio-synthetic protein that improves the lean weight
and rate of weight gain, as well as reduces the cost of feed
for market hogs, the company said.
    Specific details of the PST production project, including
sites for proposed facilities and engineering plans, were not
disclosed. International Minerals said it set a completion
target for the spring of 1989, by which time necessary Food and
Drug Administration approvals are expected to be obtained.

<TITLE>SOUTHWESTERN BELL &lt;SBC> SEES EARNINGS DILUTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ST. LOUIS, Mo., March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Southwestern Bell Corp said that
its planned acquisitions of cellular telephone and paging
systems, including those of &lt;Metromedia Inc>, will result in
some initial earnings dilution and an increase in debt ratio.
    In a letter to shareholders in its 1986 annual report, the
regional Bell company did not indicate the degree of earnings
dilution it expects from the acquisitions, which total some
1.38 billion dlrs. However, the company said the rise in its
debt ratio will be temporary and will leave its debt level
within an acceptable range.
    In its 1986 yearend financial statement, Southwestern Bell
listed a debt-to-equity ratio of 43.4 pct, down slightly from
43.7 pct in 1985.
    In 1986, the company earned 1.02 billion dlrs, or 10.26
dlrs a share, compared with 996.2 mln dlrs, or 10 dlrs a share
in 1985. Revenues dipped to 7.90 billion dlrs from 7.93 billion
dlrs.
    Southwestern Bell said it expects the new tax law to have a
negative impact on its cash flow, due mainly to the loss of
investment tax credits.
    By mid-year, however, the company said a reduced corporate
tax rate should have a positive impact on its net income and
cash flow.
    In addition, the company said it is projecting a 1.7 pct
gain in customer telephone lines and a three to four pct
increase in long distance calling volumes.
    Southwestern Bell said 1987 capital expenditures will be
lower that the 1.97 billion dlrs spent in 1986, a year in which
expenditures were held below budget.

<TITLE>BOLIVIAN DEBT BUYBACK PLAN SAID GAINING GROUND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MIAMI, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bolivia's proposal to repurchase at a
deep discount the 900 mln dlrs it owes to foreign commercial
banks is likely to be accepted, bolivian central bank governor
Javier Nogales Iturri said.
    Speaking to reporters at the annual meeting of the Inter-
American Development Bank, Nogales said Bolivia's bank advisory
committee, led by Bank of America, is seeking permission from
creditor banks worldwide to go ahead with the scheme.
    More than 50 pct of the banks must approve, and Nogales
said he is confident this threshold will be reached.
    "It's working out very well, and I think we'll get a clear
majority," Nogales said.
    A senior banker working on the deal also said that banks
are responding positively and said all the legal waivers
necessary could be obtained within two months.
    Bolivia halted all payments on its commercial bank debt in
March 1984. Hyperinfltion has been curbed and public spending
trimmed, but the country's debt still trades as low as 10 cts
on the dollar on the secondary market, and many banks have
written off most, if not all, of their loans to the country.
    Few bankers see little chance for a subtantive recovery in
Bolivia's economic fortunes and so are willing to collect what
they can on the loans.
    Nogales said Bolivia would offer to buy back the debt at a
market price. He said some banks might want to hold out for a
higher price, but others would see the repurchase offer as an
opportunity to cut their losses.
    Bolivia intends to pay for the repurchase with aid that
foreign goernments, especially the United States and West
Germany, are providing to help finance the eradication of coca
crops. Cocaine, although illegal, is Bolivia's largest export.
    The campaign to persuade farmers to grow legal crops
instead of coca would be financed instead using local currency,
Nogales said.
    Because the fiscal deficit has been reduced to some four
pct of gross domestic product, money supply could be increased
to pay for the drug-eradication drive without too much of n
impact on inflation, he added.
    Nogales said he does not expect Bolivia's debt repurchase
to become a model for other debtors in dire straits. "We're not
seeking a universal solution," he said."

<TITLE>BRAZIL WANTS TO INCREASE STEEL EXPORTS TO U.S.</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, MARCH 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil wants to increase its
steel exports to the United States, now limited because of
tough import restraints set in 1984 by the Reagan
administration, a spokeswoman for the Brazilian Steel Institute
(IBS) said.
    Brazilian and U.S. Trade officials held the first of a
three-day meeting today in Brasilia to discuss the issue.
    In 1984, after three months of painstaking negotiations,
the U.S. Government reached accords with seven steel-exporting
nations - Australia, Brazil, Japan, Mexico, Spain, South Africa
and South Korea - to reduce their shipments to the United
States by about 30 pct in 1985.
    The 1984 restraints established that for 1987 Brazil's
steel exports to the U.S. Could not exceed 632,000 tonnes,
increasing to 640,000 tonnes in 1988 and 670,000 tonnes in
1989, the last of the five-year deadline set by the agreements.
    Brazilian officials are trying to increase Brazil's export
share of non-flat products to the U.S. Market.
    The spokeswoman said there were reports of domestic supply
problems in the United States.

depressed industry conditions and Wainoco's ability to operate
in that environment. Its implied senior debt rating is CCC.

<TITLE>BALDRIGE SEES U.S. TRADE GAP DROPPING SOON</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige
said the U.S. trade deficit should start to decline soon,
possibly in the figures for February or March.
    "We could see the trade deficit start down in February or
March," Baldrige said in an appearance before the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee.
    He predicted the trade deficit, which was 170 billion dlrs
in 1986, would decline by 30 to 40 billion dlrs in 1987 and in
1988.
    Baldrige said he was making his prediction without having
seen the February trade figures, but he said that the volume of
imports has dropped beginning with the fourth quarter of 1986
and will continue to drop in this quarter.
    The eventual turnaround in the monthly trade figures will
reflect the impact of the decline in the dollar, Baldrige said.
    Ealier, Treasury Secretary James Baker told the committee
that the trade deficit had levelled off, but Baldrige said he
was more optimistic, adding, "I think we turned the corner in
February."

<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Normal work has resumed at New
Zealand ports as negotiations between harbour board workers and
employers continue.
    Wellington Harbour Board Workers' Union secretary Ross
Wilson told reporters talks late yesterday ended with agreement
to take unresolved issues before an industrial conciliator.
    Wilson said the only remaining issue is the length of the
union award. The dispute originally was about wage rates and
the form of industry negotiations.
    Cook Strait ferry sailings resumed after Marlborough
Harbour Board workers returned to work this morning, ending
their industrial action a day early.
    The Waterside Workers' Federation, which struck for most of
last week and held more than one mln tonnes of shipping in
ports, meets on Monday and Tuesday in conciliation with the
Waterfront Employers' Association.
    Union Secretary Sam Jennings said: "We've got two days of
talks. If it's not all cleaned up by then ... I don't know what
will happen."

<TITLE>LEAR-SIEGLER HOLDING TO DIVEST AEROSPACE UNIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Forstmann Little and Co said Lear
Siegler Holding Corp plans to divest its aerospace group
subsidiary, comprised of the Defense Electronics Group and the
Components Group.
    Divestitures had been expected since Lear-Siegler, a
diversified conglomerate, was acquired last December in a 2.1-
billion-dlr-leveraged buyout by the Wall Street firm of
Forstmann Little.
    Lear's aerospace group revenues for fiscal 1987 are
expected to be about 700 mln dlrs, said Forstmann.
    The Defense Electronics Group designs and manufactures
weapons, management systems, flight control systems, remotely
piloted vehicles and reference and navigation systems, mainly
for military markets.
    The Defense Group subsidiaries are Astronics Corp, which is
based in Santa Monica, Calif., and employs 1,076 people;
Instrument and Avionic Systems Corp, based in Grand Rapids,
Mich., and employs 3,479 people; International Corp, based in
Stamford, Conn., and employs 266 people; and Development
Sciences Corp, based in Ontario, Calif., and employs 237
people.
    The Components Group manufactures pumps, bearings, and
other industrial components as well as nuclear control drive
rod mechanisms and valves.
    The Group's subsidiaries include Power Equipment Corp,
based in Cleveland, which employs 880 people; Energy Products
Corp, based in Santa Ana, Calif., which employs 755 people; 
Romek Corp, based in Elyria, Ohio, which employs 262 people;
and Transport Dynamics in Santa Ana, which employs 254 people.
    Overall, Lear's Aerospace Group's eight subsidiaries
employs 7,200 people.
    Lear Siegler said it plans to retain Management Services
Corp, engaged in aircraft maintenance modification for various
Department of Defense agencies.
    Morgan Stanley and Co will act as financial advsiors for
the group's divestitures.
    Last month, Lear Siegler said it planned to sell its Smith
and Wesson handgun business, Starcraft Recreational Products
Ltd, the Peerless truck trailer operations, and other units, as
part of its restructuring plans.
    Lear apparently will retain its Piper Aircraft unit.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>LOWER U.S. SOYBEAN LOAN IDEA SHARPLY CRITICIZED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. soybean lobbyists and
congressional aides criticized a proposal from a senior
Agriculture Department official that Congress allow the U.S.
soybean loan level to be officially lowered to 4.56 dlrs per
bushel next year.
    "I don't know who in Congress would propose that happening.
Politically it would be totally unacceptable," an aide to a
senior farm-state senator said.
    USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said this week that
Congress should give USDA authority to keep the soybean loan 
at its current effective rate of 4.56 dlrs per bushel rather
than increasing it to its minimum allowed level of 4.77 dlrs.
    "I'm convinced that Congress will not go along with this,"
American Soybean Association President Dave Haggard said.
    Amstutz told reporters following a senate hearing that if
the soybean loan rate were 4.56 dlrs, USDA could then consider
ways to make U.S. soybeans more competitive.
    His comments were seen as possibly indicating what the  the
administration's position is in the debate over what should be
done to make soybeans competitive and at the same time protect
soybean farmers' income.
    Using soybean specific certificates to further buydown the
loan rate or implementation of a marketing loan have been
pointed to as the most effective ways to get soybean prices
competitive. USDA secretary Richard Lyng, however, continues to
maintain his opposition to a marketing loan, saying such a move
would be too costly.
    "There will be alot of other options that will be
considered before Congress looks at that one (the Amstutz
proposal," said Bill O'Conner, aide to Rep. Edward Madigan
(R-Ill), ranking minority leader of the Agriculture Committee.
    "Anybody representing large groups of soybean producers
would not be very excited about supporting a lower soybean
loan," O'Conner said.
    Congress may very likely look at the soybean loan and
decide that they cannot increase it from its current 5.02 dlr
basic rate, but that there has to be something mandated to
increase soybean's competitiveness, David Graves, aide to Sen.
Thad Cochran (R-Miss) said. Cochran, a staunch supporter of a
soybean marketing loan, would support a soybean loan of 5.02 or
4.77 dlrs with a certificate buydown, Graves said.

said its shareholders at the annual meeting approved a
five-for-one stock split effective May 15, 1987, to holders of
record on April 15, 1987.
    The company said the split would increase the number of
authorized common shares from 440,000 to 2,200,000 shares
issued. In addition, the company said it authorized another
800,000 shares, but would not issue them at this time.
    The company also changed the stock's par value from 10 dlrs
a share to 2.50 dlrs a share.
    It explained it transferred 1,100,000 dlrs from its
undivided profits account to its capital account in order to
raise the new par value from two dlrs, under the five-for-one
split, to 2.50 dlrs.

    Cut were Dana's senior debentures, industrial revenue bonds

of Dana and its unit Dana Credit Corp to A-2 from A-1.
    S and P said Dana's management plans an aggressive stock
repuchase which would result in a significantly more leveraged
capital structure. The combination of higher debt levels and
ongoing stock repurchases, about 12 mln shares in the past two
years financed mainly with debt, bring debt leverage to 48 pct
as of December 31, 1986 from 30 pct the year earlier.

intermediate term mortgages offer "lower interest rates,
substantial interest savings, lower inflation rates and, in
many cases, faster equity build-up" than longer-term mortgages.

<TITLE>U.S. CHIPMAKERS URGE SANCTIONS AGAINST JAPAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Semiconductor Industry
Association urged the U.S. government to impose trade sanctions
against Japan for violating the U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Trade
Agreement.
    In a letter to Treasury Secretary James Baker the group
said sanctions should be imposed against Japanese chipmakers as
of April 1 and should continue until the United States is
satisfied that there is full compliance with the agreement.
    The group said action by Japan to cut back on semiconductor
exports is not what is required.
    "America's interests require that agreements be honored and
that U.S. industries not bear the burden for the persistent
unwillingness or inability of the government of Japan to
deliver on its commitments," the trade group said.
    The White House Economic Policy Council is expected to
discuss possible sanctions against Japan at a meeting scheduled
for Thursday.
    The trade group said Japan has not lived up to the terms of
the agreement last year which was aimed at ending Japanese
dumping of semiconductors and at opening Japanese markets to
foreign-based manufacturers.

<TITLE>BOLIVIAN DEBT BUYBACK PLAN GAINS GROUND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MIAMI, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bolivia's proposal to repurchase at a
deep discount the 900 mln dlrs it owes to foreign commercial
banks is likely to be accepted, central bank governor Javier
Nogales Iturri said.
    Speaking to reporters at the annual meeting of the
Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) here, Nogales said
Bolivia's bank advisory committee, led by Bank of America, is
seeking permission from creditor banks worldwide to go ahead
with the scheme. More than 50 pct of the banks must give their
approval, and Nogales said he is confident that this threshold
will be reached.
    "It's working out very well, and I think we'll get clear
majority," Nogales said.
    A senior banker working on the deal also said that banks
are responding positively and said all the legal waivers
necessary could be obtained within two months.
    Bolivia halted all payments on its commercial bank debt in
March 1984. Hyperinflation has been curbed and public spending
trimmed, but its debt is still trading as low as 10 cts on the
dollar on the secondary market and many banks have written off
most, if not all, of their loans to the country.
    Bankers see little chance for a substantive recovery in
Bolivia's economic fortunes and so are willing to collect what
they can on the loans.
    Nogales said Bolivia would offer to buy back the debt at a
market price. He said some banks might want to hold out for a
higher price, but others would see the repurchase offer as a
window of opportunity to cut their losses.
    Bolivia intends to pay for the repurchase with aid that
foreign governments, especially the United States and West
Germany, are providing to help finance the eradication of coca
crops. Cocaine, although illegal, is Bolivia's largest export.
    The campaign to persuade farmers to grow legal crops
instead of coca would be financed instead using local currency,
Nogales said.
    Because the fiscal deficit has been reduced to some four
pct of gross domestic product, money supply could be increased
to pay for the drug-eradication drive without too much of n
impact on inflation, he added.
    Nogales said he did not expect Bolivia's debt repurchase to
become a model for other debtors in dire straits. "We're not
seeking a universal solution," he said."

<TITLE>RECENT U.S. OIL DEMAND UP 0.1 PCT FROM YEAR AGO</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. oil demand as measured by
products supplied rose 0.1 pct in the four weeks ended March 20
to 16.16 mln barrels per day from 16.15 mln in the same period
a year ago, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said.
    In its weekly petroleum status report, the Energy
Department agency said distillate demand was off 0.1 pct in the
period to 3.258 mln bpd from 3.260 mln a year earlier.
    Gasoline demand averaged 6.72 mln bpd, off 1.2 pct from
6.80 mln last year, while residual fuel demand was 1.38 mln
bpd, off 2.1 pct from 1.41 mln, the EIA said.
    Domestic crude oil production was estimated at 8.35 mln
bpd, down 7.8 pct from 9.06 mln a year ago, and gross daily
crude imports (excluding those for the SPR) averaged 3.44 mln
bpd, up 16.3 pct from 2.95 mln, the EIA said.
    Refinery crude runs in the four weeks were 11.90 mln bpd,
up 1.4 pct from 11.74 mln a year earlier, it said.
    In the first 78 days of the year, refinery runs were up 1.8
pct to an average 12.25 mln bpd from 12.04 mln in the year-ago
period, the EIA said.
    Year-to-date demand for all petroleum products averaged
16.32 mln bpd, up 1.8 pct from 16.04 mln in 1986, it said.
    So far this year, distillate demand rose 0.1 pct to 3.31
mln bpd from 3.30 mln in 1986, gasoline demand was 6.60 mln
bpd, up 0.1 pct from 6.59 mln, and residual fuel demand fell
0.4 pct to 1.42 mln bpd from 1.43 mln, the EIA said.
    Year-to-date domestic crude output was estimated at 8.41
mln bpd, off 7.7 pct from 9.11 mln a year ago, while gross
crude imports averaged 3.96 mln bpd, up 28.1 pct from 3.09 mln,
it said.

<TITLE>S/P DOWNGRADES SIX U.S. MONEY CENTER BANKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poor's Corp said it
downgraded six U.S. money center bank holding companies,
affecting about 13.3 billion dlrs of debt securities.
    They are Chase Manhattan Corp &lt;CMB>, Chemical New York Corp
&lt;CHL>, Irving Bank Corp &lt;V>, Manufacturers Hanover Corp &lt;MHC>,
Mellon Financial Corp &lt;MEL> and Security Pacific Corp &lt;SPC>.
    S and P said the action on Chase, Chemical, Irving and
Manufacturers primarily reflected continued vulnerability to
lesser developed countries and median financial performance.
    Standard and Poor's said its downgrade of Chemical also
reflected that holding company's acquisition of Texas Commerce
Bancshares &lt;TCB>, which was just now approved by the Federal
Reserve.
    For Mellon and Security Pacific, S and P cited higher
non-performing assets and weaker operating earnings.
    The rating agency said it completed a review, based on 1986
results, of the largest U.S. bank holding companies. It paid
special attention to reassessing the effect of exposures to
lesser developed countries on the holding companies' earnings
and capital.
    "Brazil's unilateral moratorium on debt service payments
underscored the potential for polarization between bankers and
debtor countries," S and P said.
    S and P noted that while Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and
Venezuela each face unique economic problems, the lack of
progress toward moderating their debt service burdens has been
disappointing.
    However, the agency pointed out that a substantive
improvement in the large banks' financial positions has acted
as a counter-balance to the Latin American debt situation.
    Citing increasing financial strength, S and P said it
affirmed the debt ratings of Citicorp &lt;CCI>, Bankers Trust New
York Corp &lt;BT>, Bank of Boston Corp &lt;BKB> and J.P. Morgan and
Co Inc &lt;JPM>.
    S and P noted that most U.S. bank holding companies have
what it termed easily realizable capital resources available to
them, such as undervalued real estate, appreciated portfolio
securities and overfunded pension plans.
    "Most bank managements appear committed to improving the
quality of their balance sheets," S and P said, noting many now
emphasize long-term strategies over short-term earnings.
    Standard and Poor's reduced Chase Manhattan's senior debt
to AA-minus from AA, subordinated debt to A-plus from AA-minus
and preferred stock to A from A-plus. The commercial paper of
the parent and its unit Chase Manhattan Bank of Canada were
affirmed at A-1-plus.
    Chase has 3.2 billion dlrs of debt outstanding. It has 6.4
billion dlrs of loans to Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and
Venezuela - one of the highest exposures to lesser developed
countries among U.S. money centers.
    Chase's underlying profitability remains at median levels
because of its high expense structure, S and P said.
    S and P cut Chemical's and the unit Chemical New York
N.V.'s senior debt to AA-minus from AA and subordinated debt to
A-plus from AA-minus.
    About 1.2 billion dlrs of long-term debt was affected.
    The agency cited Chemical's relatively large exposure to
Latin American borrowers, particulary Brazil and Mexico,
continued high levels of nonperforming assets and the pending
acquisition of Texas Commerce.
    Aggregate exposure to Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and
Venezuela was almost four billion dlrs at year-end 1986, or 105
pct of equity and reserves, S and P pointed out.
    Irving's senior debt was reduced to A-plus from AA-minus,
with subordinated debt and preferred stock lowered to A from
A-plus. Its commercial paper was affirmed at A-111-1plus.
    Irving has about 500 mln dlrs of debt outstanding. Its
approximately 1.4 billion dlrs of loans to the four major Latin
debtor countries account for 110 pct of year-end equity and
reserves.
    S and P downgraded Manufacturers Hanover's senior debt to A
from A-plus, subordinated debt to A-minus from A and preferred
stock to BBB-plus from A-minus but affirmed its A-1 commercial
paper. The bank has 3.8 billion dlrs of debt.
    S and P noted that Manufacturers has about 6.7 billion dlrs
of loans to the major Latin debtor nations and has experienced
weak earnings.
    However, the unit CIT Group Holdings Inc's AA-minus senior
debt and A-1-plus commercial paper were affirmed.
    The rating agency cut Mellon's senior debt to A-plus from
AA and preferred stock to A from AA-minus. It has 1.1 billion
dlrs of debt securities.
    The commercial paper programs of Mellon Bank Canada and
Mellon Australia Ltd, guaranteed by the parent company, were
lowered to A-1 from A-1-plus.
    S and P cited continued lower operating earnings and rising
nonperforming assets and charge-offs for Mellon.
    Security Pacific's 1.7 billion dlrs of debt was downgraded.
Cut were its senior debt to AA from AA-plus, and subordinated
debt and preferred stock to AA-minus from AA.
    Security Pacific Overseas Finance N.V.'s debt issues were
reduced to AA from AA-plus. Affirmed were the parent's A-1-plus
commercial paper and the BBB-rated debt of the unit Security
Pacific Financial Systems.
    These actions reflected Security Pacific's continued high
levels of nonperforming assets and charge-offs, S and P said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>KANSAS CITY &lt;KSU> READY TO BUY SOUTHERN PACIFIC</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Kansas City Southern Industries Inc
said it is ready to promptly purchase the Southern Pacific
Transportation Co from Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp &lt;SFX> if
the Interstate Commerce Commission rejects Sante Fe's attempt
to reopen the merger of Southern and the Atchison, Tokepa and
Santa Fe Railway.
    In a filing with the ICC late today, the company outlined
four conditions of its offer to acquire Southern Pacific.
    Among the conditions are that Santa Fe enter into an
agreement to indemnify Kansas City for any contigent liabilites
of Southern Pacific existing as of the closing date, and that
the financial condition of Southern remain largely unchanged
from today onward.
    "We are willing, even eager, to make a fair market value
offer in cash for the Southern Pacific," said Kansas City
Southern president and chief executive officer Landon H.
Rowland.
    "This offer disproves the constant derogation of the
Sourthern Pacific by SFSP management, best exemplified by SFSP
Chief Executive John Schmidt's comment in ICC hearings that the
Southern Pacific was 'bankrupt,'" said Rowland.
    He said that merging Southern with Kansas City will achieve
the benefits of an end-to-end merger while preseving the
independece of the Southern Pacific versus its existing prime
competitor, Santa Fe.
    Kansas said that Southern's management had estimated the
value of the railroad in 1983 in the range of 281 mln dlrs to
1.2 billion dlrs.
    It said that Morgan Stanley and Co Inc and Salomon Brothers
Inc, hired in 1983 to advise Southern and Santa Fe in their
merger, appraised Southern as worth between 500 mln dlrs and
800 mln dlrs less than Southern's own internal valuations.
    Kanasa City Southern said it will make an offer for
Southern after its books, records and properties are examined.
    "Once that examination has been completed (and even in the
absence of a willingnes of SFSP to negotiate) KCSI will make an
offer in writing...." said the company.
    Kansas also said it argued in the ICC filing that Santa Fe
had not met the legal requirements justifying the Commission's
reconsideration of the proposed merger of Santa Fe and Southern
Pacific, two railroads that it said basically parallel each
other throughout their routes.
    ICC voted four to one last summer to reject the merger as
inherently anticompetitive. Kansas said Santa Fe in petitioning
for reconsideration now argues that the trackage agreements
with the Union Pacific, the Denver and Rio Grande Western and
other railroads, adds to the value of the merger.

<TITLE>GENCORP &lt;GY> BID COULD BE RAISED, GROUP SAYS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    BY CAL MANKOWSKI, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>An investor group said it might be
willing to raise its 100 dlr per share offer for GenCorp but so
far the company has turned down requests for a meeting.
    "We might be able to see some additional value if we could
meet" and get more financial data, said Joel Reed, speaking for
the investor group.
    Reed told Reuters that GenCorp chairman A. William Reynolds
"was not interested in sitting down and talking with us at this
time." Cyril Wagner sought the meeting in a recent telephone
conversation with Reynolds, Reed said.
    Wagner and Brown, along with AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG>,
recently launched a surprise tender offer for GenCorp. The
offer is worth 2.23 billion dlrs.
    Reed said under the circumstances the 100 dlr per share
tender offer, which expires April 15, is a fair offer. GenCorp
gained 3-1/2 to 114 today on the NYSE.
    Reed outlined a plan to reshape GenCorp in the event his
group wins control. He said aerospace, soft drink bottling and
entertainment units are potential divestiture candidates. He
said the tire business, which the group wants to keep, may be
more viable if merged with another tire company.
    "One option would be to try to grow the tire business
through combination or an acquisition," Reed said. He said he
believes such a merger could create a stronger force in the
tire industry.
    Gary Miller, chief financial officer of AFG, said his
company has a record of acquiring mature businesses and
boosting productivity. Automation and incentives tied to profit
sharing have been used with success, he said.
    In the case of GenCorp's RKO General broadcasting stations,
Reed said the plan of the partners is to step into GenCorp's
shoes and proceed with plans to  sell the stations.
    The partners said if they succed in acquiring GenCorp they
intend to consummate sale of WOR-TV in New York to MCA Inc
&lt;MCA>. GenCorp last year entered into an agreement to sell the
station for 387 mln dlrs.
    The partners also said if they acquire Gencorp they would
also proceed with the proposed sale of KHJ-TV in Los Angeles to
Walt Disney Co &lt;DIS>. RKO General would receive 217 mln dlrs
and Fidelilty Television, which challenged the license, would
get about 103 mln dlrs.
    The partners also said the Federal Communications
Commission established an expedited schedule for receiving
comments on their request for special temporary authorization
of proposed trust arrangements while the FCC considers a formal
application for transfer of the broadcast unit.
    Reed said he was pleased with the expedited schedule
because it provides time for the agency to act on the request
before the expiration of the tender offer.
    He said it was the aim of the partners to move as quickly
as possible to eliminate uncertainty surrounding the stations.
    Asked about criticism of the takeover attempt voiced by
some municipal officials in Akron, Ohio, where GenCorp is
headquartered, Reed said, "the plan of the partners offers long
term growth for Ohio."
    He noted that the aerospace business, slated for
divestiture under the partners' plan, is located in California.
"Our program is one that overall would provide the greatest
long term growth for all segments," he said.

<TITLE>UNOCAL &lt;UCL> PLANS INCREASE IN CAPITAL SPENDING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Unocal Corp said it intends to
increase its spending for capital projects to 929 mln dlrs in
1987, eight pct more than the 862 mln spent in 1986.
    The company said in its annual report that it would
increase spending for exploration and development of petroleum
resources by about three pct to 614 mln dlrs from 1986's 595
mln dlrs, assuming oil prices hold around current levels.
    The planned spending for exploration and production in 1987
remains well below the 1.1 billion dlrs spent in 1985, Unocal
said.
    The company's proved developed and undeveloped reserves of
crude oil rose slightly in 1986, Unocal said. Net crude oil and
condensate reserves were 752 mln bbls as of Dec 31, 1986,
compared to 751 mln bbls at the end of 1985, Unocal said.
    The company said its net crude oil and condensate
production averaged 248,200 barrels per day in 1986 compared to
251,300 bpd in 1985.
    Unocal said its worldwide natural gas reserves were 6.07
billion cubic feet in 1986 compared to 1985's 6.19 billion. Net
natural gas output averaged 976 mln cubic feet per day in 1986,
down 10 pct from 1985's 1,084 mln, the company said.
    Unocal said its average sales prices for crude oil was
12.67 dlrs a barrel worldwide in 1986 compared to 23.81 dlrs in
1985, and its average sales price for natural gas was 2.03 dlrs
per thousand cubic feet in 1986 against 2.24 dlrs in 1985.
    Average production costs for crude oil and natural gas
declined nearly 30 pct to 3.41 dlrs per bbl of oil equivalent
in 1986 from 4.81 dlrs in 1985, Unocal said.
    In the annual report, the company called for imposition of
an oil import fee by the U.S. government to set a floor price
of about 25 dlrs a barrel for crude oil.
    "Simply stabilizing prices at about 18 dlrs per barrel    
will not materialy slow the drop in U.S. production or the rise
in imports," Chairman Fred Hartley said in the annual report.
    "Without decisive action in Washington, this nation will
once again become a hostage to OPEC's plans and policies,"
Hartley said.

<TITLE>VARITY&lt;VAT> SEES IMPROVED RESULTS AFTER 1ST QTR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Varity Corp, earlier reporting a full
year loss against a prior year profit, said improvement is
expected in the balance of fiscal 1987 as new products fill the
inventory pipeline, cutbacks in operating costs are realized
and its newly acquired Dayton Walther business is fully
integrated.
    However, operating results are likely to remain under
pressure in the first quarter ending April 30, it said.
    Varity earlier reported a loss for fiscal 1986 ended
January 31 of 23.3 mln U.S. dlrs, compared to a year-earlier
profit of 3.9 mln dlrs.
    Varity said continued deterioration in major markets, a
weakening U.S. dollar and unforeseen delays in launching major
new lines of tractors contributed to the full year loss.
    Industry demand for farm machinery continued to erode
during the latest fiscal year, with worldwide industry retail
sales of tractors sliding more than 10 pct below last year's
depressed levels, the company said.
    However, Varity increased its share of the global tractor
market by more than one pct to 18.2 pct, it said.
    The combined impact of costly sales incentives and foreign
exchange adjustments on margins was substantial, Varity said.

<TITLE>PENNZOIL (PZL) WILLING TO SETTLE TEXACO (TX) LAWSUIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pennzoil Co said it had not yet
received any "meaningful settlement offer" from Texaco Inc but
added that the company remained willing to consider proposals
to settle the 10.2 billion dlr jury judgment it won against
Texaco.
    In its newly-released annual report to shareholders,
Pennzoil said it expected the Texas state court judgment, which
was upheld by a state appeals court on February 12, to be
upheld if appealed again.
    "To date, Pennzoil has yet to receive any meaningful
settlement offer from Texaco, though it remains open to any
realistic effort to settle the matter," Pennzoil chairman Hugh
Liedtke said in the annual report.
    Pennzoil also said it had budgeted 212 mln dlrs for capital
spending in 1987, a drop from the 233 mln dlrs spent last year.
    Proved U.S. and foreign reserves of natural gas declined to
964 billion cubic feet last year, from 1.01 trillion cubic feet
in 1985, because of a virtual halt in its exploration program,
Pennzoil said. Its crude oil reserves dropped to 140 mln
barrels from 158 mln barrels in 1985.
     The Houston-based company said it sold an average of 339
mln cubic feet of domestic natural gas each day last year, a 17
pct drop from 1985. The average sales price for gas dropped by
60 cents per mcf to 2.16 dlrs per mcf, Pennzoil said.
    U.S. crude oil and gas liquids production last year fell to
an average of 33,290 barrels per day from 34,102 barrels per
day in 1985.
    The company's total revenues in 1986 declined to 482.3 mln
dlrs, from 762.5 mln dlrs the previous year. Operating income
in 1986 fell more than 80 pct, to 38.0 mln dlrs.
    Pennzoil said its goals for 1987 included development of
its Point Arguello oilfield off the California coast, to
maintain current production levels in its Bluebell-Altamont
Field in Utah and to drill for prospects in the Gulf of
Mexico's Mobile Bay area.
    "Production should begin late in the year from the Harvest
Platform in the Santa Maria Basin offshore California," the
company said. "Pennzoil's share of this production initially
should be five thousand barrels a day, increasing to a peak of
15 thousand barrels a day, net, by 1989."
    In its sulphur business, Pennzoil said production totaled
2.1 mln long tons last year, a decline of 18 pct from 1985. The
average sales price also declined, to 138.25 dlrs per long ton
from 141.05 dlrs in 1985.
    "The long term outlook for our sulphur operations remains
bright," the company said. "We expect sulphur's pricing
structure to strengthen during the current year, probably in
the third and fourth quarters."

<TITLE>COLOMBIA TO MAINTAIN FOREIGN BORROWING LEVELS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MIAMI, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Colombia plans to maintain foreign
borrowing at levels similar to the 1982-86 period, during which
it received a net 1.3 billion dlrs net of repayments, Finance
Minister Cesar Gaviria said.
    He told the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) annual
meeting here that despite Latin America's debt crisis, Colombia
continues to achieve positive credit flows reflecting the
strength of its economy that grew five pct last year.
    Public Credit Director Mauricio Cabrera said Colombia plans
to launch a foreign bond issue in the second half of 1987,
possibly for 60 mln dlrs.
    Cabrera said a 50 mln dlr floating rate note (FRN) issue by
Colombia is expected to close next month. It carries a 1-1/8
pct margin over Libor, with a seven year maturity and four
years grace.
    He also told Reuters he did not expect any increase in
Colombia's financing needs as a result of current falling
coffee prices, after a surge last year doubled export income
from this source to around three billion dlrs.
    "The drop will simply bring us back to 1985 levels, with a
loss of no more than about 100 mln dlrs," he said.
    Colombia, with a total foreign debt of around 13 billion
dlrs, has a foreign borrowing programme of around three billion
dlrs this year, of which about one billion is new credits.
    Its foreign reserves ended 1986 at 3.5 billion dlrs,
equivalent to more than nine months of imports and
non-financial services, and GDP growth is again expected to
reach five pct this year, Gaviria said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>The House Banking Committee adopted
legislation to direct the U.S. Treasury to begin negotiations
aimed at seeking regular adjustment of exchange rates by  
countries such as Taiwan and South Korea, whose currencies are
pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar.
    The measure was adopted as part of a wide-ranging trade
bill that will be considered by the full House in April before
it moves on to the Senate.
    The bill's many provisions also set as a priority for the
U.S. the negotiation of stable exchange rates and urge
government intervention as necessary to offset fluctuations.
    In addition, the Banking Committee bill would authorize
U.S. banks to use a variety of means to deal with the debt
problems of developing countries, such as lowering interest
rates on existing debt, renegotiating loans or debt
forgiveness. The bill would give a blanket waiver of any
federal banking regulations that bar such actions.
    The bill would direct Treasury Secretary James Baker to
discuss with debt-ridden developing countries the possibility
of the U.S. setting up a public debt management agency that
would purchase their debt at a discount and negotiate the
restructuring of the debt.
    The Banking bill authorizes U.S. participation in a
multilateral investment guarantee agency (MIGA) as requested by
the administration. Congress would approve an initial U.S.
subscription of 22 mln dlrs.
    And, it sets up a council on industrial competitiveness
composed of industry and administration members to explore ways
to make the U.S. more competitive in world markets.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Semiconductor Industry
Association urged the U.S. government to impose trade sanctions
against Japan for violating the U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Trade
Agreement.
    In a letter to Treasury Secretary James Baker the group
said sanctions should be imposed against Japanese chipmakers as
of April 1 and continue until the U.S. is satisfied there is
full compliance with the agreement.
    The group said action by Japan to cut back on semiconductor
exports is not what is required.
    "America's interests require that agreements be honored and
that U.S. industries not bear the burden for the persistent
unwillingness or inability of the government of Japan to
deliver on its commitments," the trade group said.
    The White House Economic Policy Council is expected to
discuss possible sanctions against Japan at a meeting scheduled
for Thursday.
    The trade group said Japan has not lived up to the terms of
the agreement last year which was aimed at ending Japanese
dumping of semiconductors and at opening Japanese markets to
foreign-based manufacturers.

    Moody's cited the company's overall losses.

<TITLE>COST OF PIK CERTIFICATES TO BE EYED BY CONGRESS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Nelson Graves, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Congress, eager to find budget
savings, launches a review of the U.S. Agriculture Department's
generic commodity certificate program tomorrow, amid signs USDA
and the General Accounting Office, GAO, are at odds over how
much the program has cost U.S. taxpayers.
    The GAO concluded in a preliminary report last week that
payment-in-kind, or PIK, certificates cost between five and 20
pct more than cash outlays, administration officials who asked
not to be identified said.
    USDA officials, however, took issue with the report, saying
it did not take into account storage, handling and transport
savings that accrue to the government. The GAO then decided to
re-examine the costs, sources said.
    The issue is an important one, because congressional budget
committees are known to be considering limiting the use of
certificates as a means of cutting spending.
    Agriculture Under Secretary Daniel Amstutz and GAO Senior
Associate Director Brian Crowley are set to testify before the
Senate Agriculture Committee tomorrow.
    Amstutz is expected to tell the committee that there are
uncertainties in determining the cost of certificates compared
to cash outlays, and that savings to the Commodity Credit Corp,
CCC, almost equal costs, department sources said.
    USDA estimates that it costs the government about 75 cents
to store, handle and transport each bushel of commodity put in
government storage.
    It was unclear whether the GAO, Congress' investigative
arm, would stick by its original analysis that it costs the
government more to use certificates instead of cash in farm
price and income support programs, Reagan administration
sources said.
    The GAO is expected to point out that use of
payment-in-kind, PIK, certificates has helped relieve tight
storage by moving grain that otherwise might not have been
sold.
    The testimony by Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate Director
Brian Crowley comes as congressional budget committees
intensify their efforts to pinpoint ways to cut the federal
budget deficit -- including considering limits on the use of
PIK certificates.
    The CCC issues dollar-denominated PIK certificates, or
certs, as a partial substitute for direct cash outlays to
farmers or cash subsidies to exporters. Certs can be used to
repay nonrecourse loans or exchanged for CCC commodities or
cash.
    Between April and December 1986, CCC issued 3.8 billion
dlrs worth of certificates, according to USDA. Up to another
6.7 billion dlrs worth could be issued between January and
August 1987, according to USDA.
    Certs can cost the government more than cash primarily
because recipients can use the certificates to pay back
government loans at levels below the loan rate.
    Eliminating this practice, called "PIK and roll," would save
the government 1.4 billion dlrs between 1988-92, according to
the Congressional Budget Office, CBO. That estimate, according
to a CBO official, was based on an assumption that certificates
cost the government about 15 pct more than cash payments.
    The Senate and House Budget Committees are known to be
considering curbs on PIK-and-roll transactions among other
savings alternatives.
    The GAO last week reached the tentative conclusion that the
estimated three billion dlrs of certificates redeemed to date
have cost the federal government between 150 mln and 600 mln
dlrs, or between five and 20 pct, more than cash outlays, one
administration official said.
    However, the GAO has decided to reassess those estimates
based in part on USDA criticism, department officials said.
    The broad range of the cost estimate is partly attributable
to the different effect certificates can have on market prices
over the course of a crop year.
    USDA's Economic Research Service, for example, has found
that between June and August last year, the 215 mln bushels of
corn exchanged for certificates lowered the price of corn by

<TITLE>IADB MEETING ENDS WITH U.S. ISOLATED ON REFORM</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>     By Keith Grant</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MIAMI, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States remained isolated among
the Inter-American Development Bank's 44 members as the Bank
ended its annual meeting here today without agreement on U.S.
proposals to reform the regional lending institution.
    The three-day meeting was dominated by the dispute and by
the failure of Brazil and its creditor banks to make any
breakthrough on debt talks after Brasilia suspended interest
payments last month.
    Brazil's Central Bank governor Francisco Gros said after
talks with its 14-bank advisory committee here yesterday that
it could not make a token interest payment now, as sought by
banks, but would maintain contact with the banks.
    Delegates agreed to shelve discussion of IADB reforms until
the half-yearly International Monetary Fund and World Bank
meetings in two weeks time in Washington at which a decision
will be urgently sought in order to maintain credit flows to
the recession-hit region.
    "The Bank cannot maintain an adequate lending level unless
it is given increased resources," IADB president Antonio Ortiz
Mena told a press conference.
    Ortiz Mena said 42 countries opposed Washington's proposal
to lower veto power over loans to 35 pct of the Bank's voting
shares from a simple majority as at present.
    U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said Monday the United
States, as 34.5 pct shareholder and provider of the bulk of the
Bank's resources, should have more say in approving loans and
conditioned a nine billion dlr increase in its contribution on
approving the reforms.
    But Ortiz Mena said Latin America and the non-regional
members including Europe and Japan had all supported a 40 pct
veto level. Canada declined to state a position.
    Behind the dispute was a U.S. attempt to radically change
the direction of the Bank, which has lent 35 billion dlrs to
Latin America in its 28 years, and give it a bigger role in the
current debt strategy with increased lending but more stringent
conditions attached.
    But Ortiz said the Bank cannot divert too much of its
resources to so-called sectoral lending, whereby loans to
specific sectors are tied to economic reforms, because this
could affect the Bank's Triple A rating as a borrower in world
markets.
    "For this reason we have agreed to limit sectoral loans to
25 pct of the total, leaving the rest for investment in
projects," he said.
    Ortiz Mena earlier told the Bank's closing session that as
a result of negotiations here, the Bank can expect a new
injection of about 25 billion dlrs for the period 1987-90.
    The United States has said it will only be able to support
a level close to the sixth replenishment of funds, which came
to 15.7 billion dlrs, unless its proposals are accepted.
    But despite the impasse, some Latin American delegates
including Mexican Finance Minister Gustavo Petricioli said they
were optimistic a compromise agreement could be reached next
month.

<TITLE>LATIN OIL PRODUCERS TO MEET IN CARACAS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CARACAS, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Five regional oil producing nations
will gather in Caracas tommorrow for a two-day meeting expected
to center on ways to combat proposals for a U.S. tax on
imported petroleum, the Venezuela's ministry of energy and
mines said.
    Oil ministers from Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago, Ecuador and
Venezuela will be on hand for the fifth meeting of the informal
group of Latin American and Caribbean Petroleum Exporters,
formed in 1983, it said. Colombia will also attend for the
first time, as an observer nation, the ministry said.
    Energy and Mines Minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said
the conference has no set agenda but one entire session Friday
will be devoted to proposals for a tax on imported oil.
    Two of the group's members, Venezuela and Mexico, are
second and third largest foreign suppliers of oil to the United
States, respectively, following Canada.
    Venezuela, concerned about the effect such a tax would have
on its exports, undertook a diplomatic push to coordinate
strategy against such measures. In February, Canadian Energy
Minister Marcel Masse was invited to Caracas for talks with
Hernandez on proposals for an oil import tax.

cut the rediscount rate from 17.30 pct to 17.00 pct.
    The rediscount is the rate at which the bank buys back
treasury notes.
    Market sources said the cut reflected the recent easing in
market interest rates. They also pointed to yesterday's
treasury note tender where the 400 mln dlrs of 13-week notes
went at an average yield of 15.473 pct, down from 15.870 last

<TITLE>ARGENTINA SAYS COULD FOLLOW BRAZILIAN DEBT MOVE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BUENOS AIRES, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Central Bank President Jose Luis
Machinea said Argentina could adopt the same posture as Brazil
and suspend payments on its foreign debt if it failed to meet
creditor bank demands.
    "If Argentina had the same difficulties in being unable to
refinance (its debt) under the desired (creditor) conditions,
that (Brasil's) is a path to take," Machinea said.
    Brasil last month suspended payments on a large part of its
109-billion dlr debt, the highest in the developing world.
    Machinea said Brasil did not suspend payments because it
wanted to but because it lacked reserves.
    Argentina has since last month been negotiating a 2.15
billion dlr loan with the steering committee for its
international creditor banks to meet 1987 growth targets.
    But Machinea said the talks were difficult and Argentina
wanted to conclude them as soon as possible.
    "What the (creditor) banks are demanding is not the same as
what Argentina is prepared to concede," Machinea said.
    Argentina has a global foreign debt of 50 billion dlrs. Its
debt with private banks is about 30 billion dlrs.

    "In the meeting we agreed to work on behalf of the union of

Dauster said.
    The Managua meeting was attended by representatives from
Brazil, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica,
Nicaragua and Panama, the latter represented at the meeting
merely as an observer.

the government talk to the International Monetary Fund.
    In a speech to about 3,000 mayors and local officials,
Sarney reiterated that the government would not accept any

    He said, "We are going to struggle with courage for Brazil

accept no monitoring by the IMF."
    In highly-publicized talks with Sarney near Sao Paulo last
Saturday, several Brazilian business leaders said they favoured
a return to the IMF, arguing that it would make debt
negotiations easier and bring new money into the country.

<TITLE>BAKER SAYS HE STANDS BY PARIS CURRENCY AGREEMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker said
he stood by the Paris agreement among leading industrial
nations to foster exchange rate stability around current
levels.
    "I would refer you to the Paris agreement which was a
recognition the currencies were within ranges broadly
consistent with economic fundamentals," Baker told The Cable
News Network in an interview.
    "We were quite satisfied with the agreement in Paris
otherwise we would not have been a party too it," he said.
    Baker also noted the nations agreed in the accord to
"co-operate to foster greater exchange rate stability around
those levels."
    He refused to comment directly on the current yen/dollar
rate but said flatly that foreign exchange markets recently
tended "to draw unwarranted inferences from what I say."
    Baker was quoted on British Television over the weekend as
saying he has no target for the U.S. currency, a statement that
triggered this week's renewed decline of the dollar.
    "I think the Paris agreement represents evidence that
international economic policy co-ordination is alive and well,"
Baker said.
    The Treasury Secretary stressed however it was very
important for the main surplus countries to grow as fast as
they could consistent with low inflation to resolve trade
imbalances.
    He added that Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker
has also "been very outspoken" in suggesting main trading
partners grow as fast as they can.
    Baker noted that the J-curve, the delayed beneficial effect
of a weakening of a currency on that country's trade balance,
takes 12 to 18 months to work its way through to the trade
deficit and it is now 18 months since the Plaza agreement to
lower the dollar's value.
    He also said improvements in the trade deficit should come
from other sources besides the exchange rate, and pointed out
the administration's package to improve U.S. Competitiveness
was now before Congress.

<TITLE>GUYANA FINANCE MINISTER OPTIMISTIC BUT SEEKS HELP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MIAMI, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Guyana hopes to overcome its financial
problems within three to five years and is now seeking help
from donor governments, Finance Minister Carl Greenidge said.
    He said Guyana took its problems in January to the
Caribbean Group for Cooperation and Development, which includes
governments and multilateral agencies, with a view to finding a
long-term recovery plan.
    Guyana's arrears to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
are now 70 mln dlrs and it would not be eligible for new loans
in the near future, Greenidge told Reuters during the
Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) annual meeting here. MORE
    Greenidge also said a World Bank mission would visit
Georgetown this week to assess prospects for a rescue plan that
would enable Guyana to revive its economy. But he said the
government does not expect to be able to reduce its arrears
this year.
    Arrears to the IMF and the World Bank are projected to rise
to 100 mln dlrs by the end of 1987. About 90 mln dlrs of this,
equivalent to nearly half Guyana's annual exports, would be
owed to the IMF.
    "Expecting us to pay arrears is like asking a dying man to
give a pint of blood," Greenidge said.
    But Greenidge said Guyana has taken steps to reduce its
fiscal deficit, which now amounts to 65 pct of GDP. It has
increased taxes, reduced public expenditure and refinanced its
internal debt.
    He said the World Bank would meanwhile look at investment
requirements for potential export-earning projects such as gold
mining, timber, oil and kaolin.
    Because of its arrears, Guyana has been unable to draw down
a 40 mln dlr World Bank loan for a bauxite industry
rehabilitation project. Bauxite accounts for 90 mln dlrs of
exports, or 40 pct of the total.

<TITLE>BAKER SEEKS MORE BANK LOANS TO DEVELOPING NATIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker said
banks must do more lending to developing countries.
    Baker, in an interview on Cable News Network, was asked
about such loans after Standard and Poor's Corp today
downgraded the debt of six major money centre bank holding
companies, largely because of their heavy loan exposure to
developing nations.
    Baker said developing countries must adopt free market
economic policies such as that of the United States. He said
capital flows will be required to support the needed reforms in
those countries' economic systems.
    The money must come either through equity or debt and Baker
said developing nations' "investment regimes do not support
enough equity investment, so you've got to have some debt
there."

<TITLE>BAKER SEES 15 TO 20 BILLION DLR DROP IN TRADE GAP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker said
he expected the U.S. Trade deficit to fall by 15 billion to 20
billion dlrs in 1987.
    Commenting on the deficit during an interview on Cable News
Network, Baker said "I think you're going to see a 15 to 20
billion dlr reduction this year." The deficit was 170 billion
dlrs in 1986.
    Baker noted that the benefits of a weaker currency take 12
to 18 months to affect the trade balance, and said it is now 18
months since the Plaza agreement to lower the dollar's value.

<TITLE>FURTHER YEN RISE WOULD HURT JAPAN ECONOMY, SUMITA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita
said a further yen rise would have adverse effects on the
Japanese economy.
    He told Japanese business leaders the Bank of Japan will
continue to take adequate measures, including market
intervention, to stabilize exchange rates if necessary, in
close cooperation with other major industrialized nations. He
said the current instability of exchange rates will not last.
    Six major nations - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the
U.S. And West Germany - agreed in Paris last month to act
together to hold currencies stable.
    Sumita said the Bank of Japan will continue to pursue
adequate and flexible monetary policies while watching economic
and financial developments in and outside Japan.
    He said the decision to cut the discount rate on February
20 was a hard choice for the Bank because monetary conditions
had already been sufficiently eased.
    To prevent a resurgence of inflation, the Bank will take a
very cautious stance regarding developments stemming from easy
credit conditions, he said.
    He said the latest discount rate cut to 2.5 pct should
stabilize exchange rates and expand domestic demand.
    Commenting on the dollar's fall below 150 yen, Sumita
reiterated he cannot find any specific reason for the
currency's weakness.
    The market undertook speculative dollar selling by reacting
to overseas comments by monetary authorities and trade tension,
he said.
    Sumita repeated that the Japanese economy may gradually
recover in the latter half of the 1987/88 fiscal year ending
April 1, 1988, provided exchange rates stabilize.

<TITLE>EC LINKS AGRICULTURAL TRADE TALKS TO OTHER REFORM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community (EC) considers
talks on agricultural trade reform to be inseperable from talks
on other trade reform in the present GATT round, Willy de
Clercq, external relations commissioner of the EC, said.
    He told reporters here the EC would not bow to pressure to
reach an early, seperate agreement on agricultural trade.
    He said the EC wanted to stick to the four-year schedule
agreed by members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last year. That included
agricultural trade liberalisation for the first time in the
lengthy program to re-negotiate the GATT.
    Other trade issues being discussed in the current GATT
round include reform of trade in merchandise and services.
    De Clercq is on his way to China after attending a two-day
conference for 22 GATT trade ministers held in New Zealand.
    Several of those ministers criticised the EC for what they
saw as restrictive agricultural trade practices and called for
urgent reforms. U.S. Trade representative, Clayton Yeutter,
also said it was important agreement on agricultural trade
reform was reached as early as possible.
    But de Clercq said the GATT program had been reached after
long and hard negotiations, and the EC did not want changes.
    "We just want to stick to the agreement which was reached,
and that was very clear -- that the new round would be one
undertaking. It is a global negotiation with no two tracks, no
fast track, no slow track. It has just one track, the track -
and that's all," de Clercq said.
    "If you start selecting priorities, your priority is not my
priority. We say that agriculture is urgent, but it's not the
only urgent thing," he said.
    He said the Punte del Este agreement had taken eight months
to prepare and eight days of negotiations.

more food to ease shortages and meet economic recovery goals
set for 1990.
    The army newspaper Quan Doi Nhan Dan, monitored here, said
soldiers must work harder to care for rice, vegetables and
other crops endangered by the present unusually hot weather.
    The paper said the 1.6-mln strong regular army contributed
less than one pct to the nation's 18.2 mln tonne food output.
    North Vietnam has set a 1990 food target of 23 to 24 mln
tonnes.

<TITLE>LINDE TURNOVER UP IN FIRST TWO MONTHS OF 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WIESBADEN, West Germany, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Engineering group Linde
AG's &lt;LING.F> world group turnover rose to 518.6 mln marks in
the first two months of 1987, 5.2 pct more than in the same
1986 period, management board chairman Hans Meinhardt said.
    But world group incoming orders fell 2.2 pct to 587.3 mln
marks, Meinhardt told the annual news conference. Excluding
exchange rate movements, world group turnover rose 8.9 pct and
incoming orders increased 1.0 pct.
    Linde expects satisfactory results and increased sales this
year but Meinhardt gave no detailed forecast. Domestic group
1986 net profit rose to 105.79 mln marks from 80.71 mln.
    Meinhardt said domestic group turnover rose 6.7 pct to
394.1 mln marks in the first two 1987 months against the same
period last year but incoming orders fell 5.2 pct to 456.6 mln.
    Linde will ask shareholders at the annual meeting on May 13
to raise authorised share capital by a maximum 30 mln marks
nominal for the issue of share warrant bonds with a maximum
issue volume of 200 mln marks. Linde's authorised share capital
currently stands at a nominal 49.6 mln marks.
    Meinhardt said the authorisation would give the company the
necessary flexibility in case Linde needed additional funds for
acquisitions. He declined to give further details.
    While world group turnover rose 7.2 pct to 3.88 billion
marks in 1986, incoming orders were barely changed at 3.91
billion marks. Meinhardt said without the sharp appreciation of
the mark against major trading partner currencies, incoming
orders would have been four pct above the prior year's level.
    World group turnover in heavy plant construction rose 7.4
pct to 777 mln marks, but incoming orders dropped 5.7 pct to
739 mln marks in the wake of the dollar and oil price plunge.
    World sales for technical gases rose 5.1 pct to 1.05
billion marks and incoming orders gained 5.2 pct to 1.05
billion marks.
    Meinhardt said Linde strengthened its market position in
the refrigeration sector, with particularly strong turnover and
order gains in Austria, Italy and Norway. World group sales in
the sector fell 2.5 pct to 493 mln marks, but incoming orders
rose 2.5 pct to 513 mln marks.
    The fork lift truck and hydraulic sector saw world group
sales rising 12.4 pct to 1.52 billion marks and incoming orders
gaining 8.0 pct to 1.57 billion marks.
    Domestic group turnover rose 8.2 pct to 2.93 billion marks
and incoming orders increased 1.9 pct to 2.92 billion marks.
The company was producing at full capacity in 1986.

    He told business executives the most important issues for
the world economy are the correction of international trade
imbalances and a solution to the world debt problem.
    To this end, Japan and the U.S. Must make medium- and
long-term efforts to alter economic structures which have
expanded the trade gap between the two nations. World economic
growth and therefore an expansion of debtor countries' export
markets are needed to solve the debt issue, he added.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>PHILIPPINE DEBT TALKS PROCEED WITH NARROWER FOCUS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The latest round of talks between
Philippine officials and the country's commercial bank
creditors on the rescheduling of 9.4 billion dlrs worth of debt
are still proceeding, but with a narrower focus, Philippine
Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin said.
    He told a press briefing Wednesday that Manila has dropped
a two-tier interest payment offer, which would have given banks
a higher return if they took partial payment in new Philippine
investment notes (PINs) instead of in cash.
    "The PINs proposal has been laid aside.... The discussion is
now on pricing (of just the cash payments)," he said.
    Foreign banking sources in Manila said on Tuesday that the
Philippines had raised its basic interest rate offer to 7/8
over the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) but Ongpin would
not discuss details of the pricing negotiations.
    He also refused to speculate on when an overall agreement
might be reached. The talks have been going on for more than
three weeks.
    Manila originally offered to pay interest in cash at 5/8
over LIBOR or in a mixture of cash and PINs -- tradeable,
dollar-denominated, zero coupon notes that could potentially
yield up to one point over LIBOR.
    The PINs option was subsequently modified to guarantee at
least a 7/8 point spread over LIBOR but many bankers still had
grave reservations, seeing it as a possible precedent for other
large debtors to avoid paying interest in cash.
    The PINs proposal has now been left on the table as a
separate option for those banks, which might want to fund their
own investments in the Philippines or sell the notes in the
secondary market, Ongpin said.
    Under Manila's plan, the PINs would be redeemable at full
face value in Philippine pesos to fund local equity investments
at any time prior to their six-year maturity date.
    While the commercial banks had their doubts about the PINs
proposal, Ongpin said there was great interest on the part of
certain investment banks which are already active in the
secondary market for sovereign debt.
    Unlike current debt/equity schemes, Ongpin said, the PINs
would include no government fees and would be free from
"administrative hassles."
    He said about six investment banks had been approached and
four had replied so far. One even showed interest in buying 45
mln dlrs worth of notes, he said.
    Ongpin said that by funding current interest payments in
the secondary market through the PINs scheme, the Philippines
could conserve at least one to 1.5 billion dlrs of foreign
exchange reserves during its planned seven-year restructuring
period.

<TITLE>GARCIA SAYS PERU NOT TRYING TO EXPORT DEBT STANCE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MEXICO CITY, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Peruvian President Alan Garcia said
his government was not trying to convince other nations to
follow its decision to limit foreign debt repayments.
    "We do not want to export a model," Garcia told a press
conference at the end of an official two-day visit to Mexico
yesterday. He was referring to Peru's policy of limiting
payments on its 14 billion dlr debt to 10 pct of its export
earnings.
    Peru's attitude contrasts with that of Mexico, which
followed a more conciliatory route and last week signed a 7.7
billion dlr loan package with its creditor banks.
    Since it decided to put a ceiling on debt payments, Peru
has been barred from International Monetary Fund lending.
    Despite their different approaches to debt, Garcia and
Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid issued a joint
declaration yesterday calling the foreign debt problem an
"expression of the present unjust international economic order."
But the declaration said that no Latin American debtors' club
was about to appear.
    "We affirm the sovereignty of our economic decisions and the
capacity for mobilising our own resources," it said.
    The two presidents also signed a variety of agreements
aimed at boosting trade and tourism between their countries as
well a number of technical cooperation pacts.
    Garcia was scheduled to return to Lima tomorrow.

    Weinberger told reporters prior to a speech at Texas

the Straits of Hormuz at the mouth of the Gulf were still "free

<TITLE>MIYAZAWA SAYS MAJOR NATIONS ACTING ON PARIS ACCORD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said
major nations are taking action to stabilise exchange rates in
line with their agreement in Paris last month, government
sources said.
    Miyazawa told an Upper House session the six nations --
Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany --
are abiding by the Paris accord. The six agreed to cooperate to
stabilise exchange rates at around current levels.
    Miyazawa said he wishes to attend a meeting of seven major
nations (G-7) expected just before the IMF/World Bank Interim
Committee meeting in Washington starting on April 9.
    The sources quoted Miyazawa as saying Japan is trying to
prevent a further rise of the yen. Japan is taking the matter
seriously, he added.
    Asked if the six nations had agreed to stabilise the dollar
at about 153 yen, the rate prevailing at the time of the Paris
talks, Miyazawa declined to give specific figures and said any
mention of specific rates would create an "unexpected situation."

<TITLE>U.S. HOUSE PANEL APPROVES 400 MLN DLRS FOREIGN AID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The House of Representatives
Appropriations Committee yesterday approved 300 mln dlrs in
economic aid for four Central American states, 50 mln dlrs to
black-led states neighbouring South Africa and 50 mln dlrs in
military assistance for the Philippines.
    The programmes, part of 1.3 billion dlr supplemental budget
request by the Reagan administration to restore funds cut
earlier by Congress, must be approved by Congress.
    The committee rejected the administration's request for
21.6 mln dlrs as the U.S. Contribution to U.N. Peace-keeping
troops in Lebanon.
    The 300 mln dlrs will go to El Salvador, Honduras,
Guatemala and Costa Rica while another 12 mln dlrs was
allocated to replace the earthquake-damaged U.S. Embassy in San
Salvador.
    The 50 mln dlrs approved for a "Southern Africa" initiative
is part of a larger programme promised by the Reagan
administration last year when it tried unsuccessfully to block
sanctions approved by Congress against South Africa's
white-minority government.

<TITLE>BANK OF FRANCE LAUNCHES MONEY MARKET TENDER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of France said it set a money
market intervention tender today to inject funds to the market
against first category paper.
    Money market sources said the surprise announcement might
herald a quarter percentage point cut in the central bank
intervention rate from the 7-3/4 pct level set March 10, but
they added such a cut was relatively unlikely.
    The intervention rate was cut from eight pct on March 10
after being raised from 7-1/4 pct on January 2 to head off
speculative pressure against the franc.
    Dealers said market fundamentals could justify a further
easing, but a combination of technical factors and renewed
currency uncertainties surrounding the dollar had put
short-term upside pressure on interest rates in recent
sessions.
    Call money rose yesterday to 7-7/8 eight pct from 7-3/4 7/8
pct. Today it was first indicated at 8-1/8 1/4 before easing on
news of the tender to 7-13/16 7/8 pct.
    Technical factors making for a slight shortage of liquidity
in the market included the settlement yesterday of the latest
monthly treasury tap stock tender, on March 5, market sources
said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>BP TO OFFER 7.4 BILLION DLRS FOR STANDARD SHARES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L> said it
intended to make a tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard Oil
Co &lt;SRD.N> it does not already own at 70 dlrs a share cash, for
a total of 7.4 billion if the offer is fully accepted.
    The offer would be made through its &lt;BP North America Inc>
unit and was intended to commence not later than April 1. The
offer would not be conditional on any minimum number of shares
being tendered.
    BP said in a statement the 70 dlr a share price was based
on its own valuation as well as those of its financial
advisers. It took into account reviews of both public and
non-public information.
    Standard closed in New York last night at 64-7/8 dlrs, down
1-3/4 dlrs.
    BP shares dropped on the announcement to 877p from 888p at
last night's close.
    About a third of the cash payable would be met from BP's
own resources.
    The remainder would come from new borrowings, partly from
banks under a four-year committed revolving credit facility and
partly from a a new U.S. Dlr commercial paper programme. The
company said it was in the course of arranging these
facilities.
    BP Chairman Sir Peter Walters said that the group's
investment in Standard was its largest single asset. Full
ownership would enable investment and operating decisions to be
made without the limitations of a minority interest.
    BP also believed the acquisition represented the optimum
use of its financial resources. It was confident oil prices
were likely to remain within a range sufficient to justify the
investment.
    Walters added that it also felt that, due to management
changes in 1986, Standard could now operate successfully even
in a lower oil price environment.
    Standard's net assets at end-1986 were 7.02 billion dlrs
and in the year it reported a loss of 1.08 billion dlrs before
tax and before an extraordinary item of 608 mln dlrs.
    Analysts said that the move by BP had come as a surprise.
One noted that it was not immediately clear why the group
should spend so much money buying a company it already
controlled.
    BP could also have bought up the remainder of Standard
shares considerably cheaper had it moved six months ago.
    It was also unclear what effect the tender would have on
the U.K. Government's recent announcement that it intended to
dispose of its remaining 31.7 pct stake in BP sometime in the
1987/88 financial year, analysts said.
    Analyst Paul Spedding of brokers Kleinwort Grieveson noted
that any effect on the government sale of its stake in BP would
depend on the reaction of the markets.
    The deal would probably push BP's gearing up to around 59
pct from 20 pct currently, he said.
    However, with the likelihood that oil prices would not
repeat last year's rapid drop the prospects for Standard
returning to profitability this year -- and BP benefitting from
its cash flow -- were good.
    Standard was a high cost oil producer, the analysts noted.
    Spedding noted that it needed about 12 dlrs a barrel to
make money, and at about 15 dlrs a barrel revenue from
production and its downstream activities would push it
comfortably into surplus.
    BP initially took a stake in Standard following the
discovery of oil in Alaska's Prudhoe bay in 1969. BP had
inadequate distribution facilities in the U.S. While Standard,
which was strong on marketing and refining, was short on crude
oil.
    The analysts said that BP had promoted a major management
reorganisation of Standard in the past year.
    The probability that much of the shake-up at Standard was
now complete was one possible factor behind the timing of the
tender offer, Spedding said.
    BP's willingness to take hard decisions such as major
balance sheet write offs and the sale of assets had been well
received in the markets.
    The lower costs that should now be possible -- especially
after the rationalisation of the loss making minerals division
-- should allow the benefits of an oil price recovery to come
straight through to 1987 profits without being cut back by
other sectors.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>HOECHST RAISES PROFITS ON LOWER SALES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hoechst AG &lt;HFAG.F> said in a
statement it increased its pretax profits in 1986 despite a
fall in turnover due to lower foreign sales.
    The lower sales were due to the fall in the dollar and
other currencies against the mark. Other factors were pressure
on selling prices because of a sharp fall in the prices of
crude oil and petrochemical raw materials and the sale of
polystyrene business in the U.S. And Netherlands.
    World group pretax profit rose to 3.21 billion marks in
1986 from 3.16 billion in 1985, with sales falling to 38.01
billion from 42.72 billion.
    Within group turnover, foreign sales fell to 27.18 billion
marks in 1986 from 31.92 billion in 1985, a drop of 14.9 pct.
    The statement made no mention of net profit figures.
Hoechst will announce its dividend proposal on April 23.
    In the first quarter of this year sales were hit by the
cold weather at the start of the year. If the dollar continues
at present low levels, 1987 sales will again be below the
previous year, although in volume terms they are unchanged from
1986, Hoechst said.
    Sales of paints and dyes, fibres, sheeting and information
technology all rose in 1986 but plant construction sales fell.
    Hoechst attributed its good results to the performance of
the parent company, other units in West Germany, and to
&lt;American Hoechst Corp>.
    Improved earnings in the U.S. Largely reflected the
restructuring of styrene and polystyrene activities.
    Roussel Uclaf &lt;RUCF.PA> and most domestic non-consolidated
partners did not perform as well as in 1985.
    Hoechst attributed the 12 pct rise in parent company pretax
profits to 1.82 billion marks above all to a rise in earnings
from interest and holdings in other companies, and a fall in
extraordinary costs.
    The fall in raw material prices was not enough to
compensate for the decline in turnover due to lower prices and
currencies, Hoechst said.
    The bulk of the 2.53 billion marks investment in new
projects, up from 294 mln marks in 1985, went on the capital
increase of Hoechst Capital Corp in connection with the
acquisition of &lt;Celanese Corp>.
    Celanese was merged with American Hoechst in February to
form &lt;Hoechst Celanese Corp>.

<TITLE>BHP NET SEEN AROUND 600 MLN DLRS FOR NINE MONTHS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Australia's largest company, The Broken
Hill Pty Co Ltd &lt;BRKN.S> (BHP), is expected to report a net
profit of around 600 mln to 620 mln dlrs tomorrow for the first
nine months ended February 28, share analysts polled by Reuters
said.
    This would be well below the 813.0 mln dlrs earned in the
first three quarters of 1985/86. In the full year ended May 31
1986 the group earned a record 988.2 mln dlrs.
    The analysts estimated that the group would report a third
quarter net in the region of 200 mln to 220 mln dlrs, against
238.6 mln a year earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter.
    BHP's earnings in the first half ended November 30 amounted
to 397.0 mln dlrs, sharply down from 589.3 mln a year earlier.
    The analysts predicted that BHP will report an upturn in
petroleum earnings compared with the first quarter, reflecting
some improvement in crude oil prices from the Bass Strait
fields, but these gains would be offset by lower mineral and
steel earnings.
    They said the mineral group has been hit by lower coal
prices and shipments to Japan while the steel division has been
affected by industrial and production problems.
    The analysts noted that the third quarter is normally BHP's
lowest-earning period owing to a number of seasonal factors,
and they predicted a sharp rise in fourth quarter net to around
300 mln dlrs.
    One key factor in the fourth quarter is expected to be a
tax break of some 70 mln dlrs for the investment allowance on
capital expenditure in the steel division, they said.
    They said they saw BHP's full year earnings at around 900
mln to 920 mln dlrs. They added that such a decline from
1985/86 would be no surprise, noting BHP has said that it would
be difficult to equal its record 1985/86 net profit.

<TITLE>BP UNITS SEEK FIVE BILLION DLR REVOLVING CREDIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>BP International and BP North America
are seeking a five billion dlr, four year syndicated credit
facility in support of British Petroleum Co Plc's tender offer
for the 45 pct of Standard Oil Co it does not already own,
Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York said as arranger.
    The facility, to be guaranteed by British Petroleum Co Plc
&lt;BP.L> is probably the largest credit facility ever arranged in
Europe, bond analysts said. Full terms will be announced either
later today or tomorrow morning. BP said earlier it planned a
tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard it does not already own
for 70 dlrs a share cash.
    The financing being arranged by Morgan Guaranty will take
the form of a fully committed revolving credit. As announced
earlier, BP also is arranging a U.S. Commercial paper program
in connection with the tender and part of the revolver will be
used to support that program.
    The exact size of the U.S. Program has not been decided and
the dealers have not yet been chosen.
    The credit facility will also allow the borrower to issue
cash advances with maturities of one, three or six months
through a tender panel, which will be comprised of banks
committed to the facility.
    Despite the unprecedented size of this euromarket facility,
Morgan Guaranty said that it was being syndicated only among
BP's relationship banks.
    As a result, banks were being offered lead manager status
at 200 mln dlrs, co-lead management at 125 mln and manager at
75 mln.
    Although pricing on many credit facilities has become
extremely fine in recent years because of the keen competition
to win mandates, Morgan Guaranty said banks would be
compensated fairly since this is a special purpose facility
which must be completed quickly, with signing expected in about
10 days.

<TITLE>EC SUGAR TENDER SEEN AS FURTHER CONCESSION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The rebates granted at yesterday's EC
sugar tender represent a further concession to producers'
complaints that they are losing money on exports outside the
bloc, trade sources said.
    They said the maximum rebate of 45.678 European currency
Units (Ecus) per 100 kilos was 0.87 Ecus below what producers
claim is needed to obtain the equivalent price to that offered
for sales into intervention.
    The rebate at last week's tender was 1.3 Ecus short of the
level producers thought necessary and that of the previous week
was 2.5 Ecus below this level.
    But the sources said producers who have offered a total of
854,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention in an apparent
attempt to persuade the Commission to set higher maximum
rebates have given no formal indication to the Commission that
they intend to withdraw these offers.
    The French and German operators involved would be able to
withdraw the offers up to five weeks after April 1 when the
sugar will officially enter intervention stores.
    The five-week period is the normal delay between sugar
going into intervention and payment being made for it.
    EC officials have said that if the Commission has to buy
the sugar, it is determined immediately to resell it, a move
which could drive down market prices further.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>GERMAN CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS WIDENS IN FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     WIESBADEN, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>West Germany's current account
surplus widened to a provisional 6.6 billion marks in February
from a slightly downwards revised 4.8 billion in January, a
spokeswoman for the Federal Statistics Office said.
    The trade surplus in February widened to a provisional 10.4
billion marks from 7.2 billion in January, she added.
    The Statistics Office had originally put the January
current account surplus at 4.9 billion marks.
    The February trade surplus was well up on the 6.84 billion
mark surplus posted in the same month of 1986. But the current
account surplus was down slightly from the 6.85 billion surplus
recorded in February 1986.
    A Statistics Office statement said the widening of the
February current account surplus compared with January was due
to seasonal factors. Neither the trade nor current account
figures are seasonally adjusted.
    February imports, measured in terms of value, totalled
32.11 billion marks, a decline of 10 pct against February 1986
but a rise of 5.5 pct against January.
    Exports in February, also in value terms, totalled 42.56
billion marks, 0.5 pct less than in February 1986 but up 13 pct
compared with January.
    The Statistics Office said it was not yet able to calculate
the real change in exports and imports in February. But for
comparison purposes it noted that in January the average value
of imports had fallen 15 pct year-on-year while the average
value of exports had declined by only 4.4 pct.
    Within the current account, the services account had 300
mln marks deficit, supplementary trade items a 200 mln mark
surplus while transfer payments posted a 3.7 billion mark
deficit.
    Taking the first two months of 1987 together, imports in
value terms fell 14 pct to 62.6 billion marks compared with a
year earlier. The value of exports totalled 80.2 billion marks,
a decline of 7.4 pct against the same months of 1986.
    The resulting trade surplus of 17.6 billion marks for
January/February compares with a cumulative surplus of 14.1
billion marks in the year-ago period.
    The cumulative current account surplus for January and
February 1987 totalled 11.3 billion marks against 11.4 billion
marks a year earlier, the Statistics Office said.
    Bank economists said the rise in the February trade surplus
reflected an improvement in the terms of trade as well as
seasonal factors. The Federal Statistics Office said earlier
this week that February import prices fell 0.7 pct against
January while export prices were unchanged.
    "The rise in the nominal figures masks a lower export trend
that is not expected to change for several months at least,"
said an economist. He said the nominal trade surplus for 1987
as a whole is likely to fall only slightly from the record
112.2 billion marks in 1986 but other economists said the
surplus could fall to around 80 billion marks.
    An economist at the Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft (BfG) in
Frankfurt said a two-month comparison of trade figures gave a
more accurate picture of West Germany's trade position.
    He noted the 17.6 billion mark surplus for January and
February together was lower than the 21.6 billion mark surplus
posted in November and December.
    "The trend is clearly lower," he said.
    This economist, who declined to be named, said the February
rise was also partly explained by special factors in January,
when there had been a number of public holidays as well as
extremely cold weather, both of which hindered trade.

economic growth at slightly under two pct in the financial year
ending June this year, down from the 2.25 pct forecast
contained in the 1986/87 budget delivered last August.
    Australia's terms of trade also fell, by 18 pct, over the
past two years, he told Parliament. Terms of trade are the
difference between import and export price indexes.
    Despite the figures, the budget forecast of about 1.75 pct
annual growth in employment would be met, Keating said.
    Unemployment is currently at 8.2 pct of the workforce.
    "This government is dragging Australia through a trading
holocaust the kind of which we have not seen since the Second
World War," Keating said.
    "We are not pushing this place into a recession. We are not
only holding our gains on unemployment, we are bringing
unemployment down," he said, adding that the government had help
the country avoid recession.

<TITLE>JAPAN BEEF PRICE SUPPORT CUT WILL NOT RAISE DEMAND</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Fumiko Fujisaki, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's plan to cut beef intervention
prices for the fiscal year starting April 1 will not boost
demand because of strict supply controls and a complex
distribution system, Japanese and U.S. Industry sources said.
    "Government beef policy protects farmers rather than meeting
consumers' demands and the cutback ... Is too marginal," a
Housewives Association of Japan official said.
    Despite mounting U.S. Pressure on Japan to open farm
markets, beef is strictly controlled by the government, which
maintains a price stabilisation zone to protect farmers.
    Under the plan, expected to be announced this month, the
standard or bottom price of castrated wagyu -- known as marbled
beef -- will be set at 1,370 yen per kilo for 1987/88 against
1,400 now, and the ceiling at 1,780 yen against 1,820.
    The standard price of other beef, mainly produced from
dairy steers, is set at 1,020 yen against 1,090 and the ceiling
at 1,325 against 1,420.
    Ministry officials said the semi-government Livestock
Industry Promotion Corp (LIPC) conducts buffer stock operations
to help keep wholesale beef prices within the intervention
price zone.
    The LIPC is allowed to import most beef, with the amount
set by the government under a quota system. When wholesale
prices go above the ceiling, the LIPC releases its beef stocks,
both domestic and imported, and buys locally produced beef when
prices are below.
    But the LIPC has often been criticised for releasing beef
stocks when the prices are higher than the ceiling.
    Phillip Seng, Asian Director of the U.S. Meat Export
Federation, told Reuters the two pct cut in prices is a step
toward closing the gap with European Community prices, about
half those in Japan.
    But Seng said the cut will not benefit consumers or U.S.
Meat exporters because of Japan's rigid and complicated
distribution system and strict supply control by the LIPC.
    The Housewives Association official said retail beef prices
are high mainly because of distribution problems and high
production costs, as well as poor operations by the LIPC.
    American meat packers see Japan as a promising market. F.C.
Beatty, of U.S. Packer John Morrell and Co, told the Japan
Times beef cuts, which sell for 1.20 to 3.00 dlrs a pound in
the U.S., Are sold at 15 to 30 dlrs in Japan.
    But Seng said the cut will not benefit consumers or U.S.

Times beef cuts, which sell for 1.20 to 3.00 dlrs a pound in
the U.S., Are sold at 15 to 30 dlrs in Japan.
    But industry sources said it is unclear how much demand
will pick up if retail beef prices drop following any sharp
reduction in intervention prices.
    U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said this week he
will ask Japan to remove all beef import restrictions when he
visits here next month.
    In 1984, Japan decided to increase its beef import quota by
9,000 tonnes a year until March 31, 1988.
    In 1987/88, the quota will rise to 177,000 tonnes from
168,000 in 1986/87, ministry officials said, adding Japan wants
to keep self-sufficiency in beef at around 70 pct.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>One of two rival firms seeking to enter
Japan's international telecommunications market said it will
offer a stake in the company to 10 foreign firms.
    President of &lt;International Telecom Japan Inc> (ITJ), Nobuo
Ito, decline to specify what share the firms would take, but
told Reuters they would not participate in its management.
    ITJ and &lt;International Digital Communications Planning Inc>
(IDC), in which both Cable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L> and
Pacific Telesis Group &lt;PAC.N> own 20 pct stakes, are set to
merge into a new entity to compete against &lt;Kokusai Denshin
Denwa Co Ltd> (KDD).
    The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has urged the
two rival firms to merge so KDD would have only a single
competitor. The ministry has also rejected foreign management.
    Japan's law limits foreign ownership of any new
international telecommunications entrant to 33 pct, so C and
W's and Pacific's stakes could be three pct in the merged firm,
sources said. Those seeking to join are General Electric Co
&lt;GE.N>, Ford Motor Co &lt;F.N>, &lt;Citibank NA>, BankAmerica Corp
&lt;BAC.NYSE>, &lt;Shearson Lehman Bros Inc>, &lt;Saloman Brothers>,
&lt;Asia Boeing Computer Service>, Unisys Corp &lt;UIS.N>, &lt;Societe
Generale> and Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.FRA>.
    The merger plan has been criticised for excluding foreign
firms from a meaningful position in the market.
    The U.K.'s Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, U.S. Secretary
of State George Shultz, U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm
Baldrige and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter have all
expressed such opposition.
    Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will draft a
reply to the criticism following further discussion, a Posts
and Ministry official said.

<TITLE>SINGAPORE LAWS TO LIBERALISE LOCAL CAPITAL MARKET</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Lai Kwok Kin, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SINGAPORE, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Parliament passed laws increasing the
amounts and frequency of treasury bill issues and allowing the
government to raise up to 35 billion dlrs through issues of
registered stock, bearer bonds and book-entry securities.
    Both steps are aimed at establishing a wider domestic
capital market as part of Singapore's plans to expand its
financial sector, Finance Minister Richard Hu said.
    Banking sources said the new government securities market,
scheduled to have been launched on March 2, had been delayed
pending legislative approval of these bills.
    The 35 billion dlrs maximum which may be raised under the
Development Loan Bill (1987), against a ceiling of 15 billion
under current laws, is expected to satisfy demand for
government securities over the next four years, Hu said.
    He said 6.1 billion dlrs of the 15 billion has so far been
raised as development loans. The rest will be used up when
bonds are issued to absorb advance deposits of 13.9 billion
dlrs from the Central Provident Fund (CPF), a mandatory pension
savings scheme. Workers and employers contribute a respective
25 pct and 10 pct of a worker's salary to the CPF, which had
funds totalling 29.3 billion at end-1986.
    Regular government securities issues are needed to meet the
demand of banks, insurance companies, other financial
institutions and corporate and individual investors, Hu said.
    The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) had said it
planned to launch trading by issuing taxable instruments
grossing seven billion dlrs in the first year and a gross 38
billion dlrs of paper over the next five years.
    Funds raised in excess of the government's budgetary needs
will not be channelled into increased spending, but will be
recycled back to the financial system, largely through the MAS,
Hu said.
    Hu said the current government securities market is
rudimentary, with the CPF holding three-quarters of the
outstanding debt and banks, discount houses and insurance
companies holding the rest. "The concentration of securities in
the hands of such long-term holders has left little scope for
trading activity," he said.
    "Moreover, the maturity of the bonds, mostly 20 years, was
not attractive to other investors who might have been expected
to deal more actively in the market. The infrequency of bond
issues exacerbated the lack of liquidity necessary for the
development of a market," Hu said.
    Hu said these obstacles have been resolved and regular
issues of government securities will be made, initially
carrying terms of up to five years and market-related yields.
    The minimum denomination is 1,000 dlrs for notes and bonds
-- aimed at individual investors -- and 10,000 dlrs for the
treasury bills, which are directed at corporate investors.
    Eight primary and registered dealers have undertaken to
make markets in order to ensure liquidity, he said.
    Hu said while the new government securities market will be
essentially domestic, non-residents are free to invest, but
interest earned will be subject to withholding tax.
    Hu said under the new Treasury Bills (Amendment) Bill, all
book entries of borrowings through treasury bill issues must be
made in records maintained by MAS.
    Hu said that instead of physical certificates having to
travel back and forth at each transaction, with side trips to
the MAS for registration, the MAS will maintain a computerised
system for updating records in a central register.
    Commercial banks and primary and registered government
securities dealers will each have two securities accounts with
the MAS, one for their own holdings and the other for holdings
on behalf of all their customers, Hu said.
    All trades will be reflected daily in changes in these
accounts, Hu said.
    "These institutions will in turn act as custodians of
government securities for their customers, rendering each an
individual accounting of his holdings."
    Hu said the new system will cut storage and handling costs
and paper work, reduce the danger of loss, theft, destruction
and counterfeiting, and permit greater speed and efficiency in
handling large volumes of transactions.

<TITLE>SIEMENS SEES SALES NEAR 52 BILLION MARKS THIS YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MUNICH, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>World group turnover of Siemens AG
&lt;SIEG.F> should rise to 51 or 52 billion marks in the current
year to September 31 after a 19 pct upturn in the first five
months, management board chairman Karlheinz Kaske said.
    Siemens reported world group turnover in 1985/86 of 47.02
billion marks.
    Kaske told the annual shareholders meeting turnover rose to
21.2 billion marks in the first five months of 1986/87, about
19 pct above the same year-ago period. The rise was mainly due
to payment in January for a West German nuclear power station
which led to a jump in domestic sales of 36 pct.
    In the first five 1986/87 months, turnover abroad showed a
three pct increase, Kaske said, without giving figures.
    In the same period incoming orders rose five pct to 21.8
billion marks against the same 1985/86 period.
    For the year as a whole incoming orders should rise between
one and two billion marks to around 51 or 52 billion.
    Apart from payments for the nuclear power station, the
communications and telecommunications sectors in particular
should contribute to growth this year, Kaske said.
    But it was not possible to make a profit forecast for
1986/87 because of uncertainty about the direction of the
dollar, Kaske said.
    Siemens already reported that first quarter 1986/87 group
net profit fell marginally to 296 mln marks from 298 mln in the
same period in the previous year.
    Turnover in the first five months rose particularly
strongly in the installations and automotive technology,
communications and telecommunications sectors, but components
and energy and automation showed a sharp decline.
    Kaske said domestic orders rose to 10.2 billion marks in
the first five months of this year, or nine pct above their
level in the same 1985/86 period, boosted in particular by
orders for the fully owned Kraftwerk Union AG subsidiary.
    Foreign orders grew one pct to 11.6 billion marks. An
increase in orders through newly acquired subsidiaries abroad
was balanced by the decline in the dollar.
    While the installations and automotive technology sector
showed a sharp rise in orders, energy and automation and
communications orders were below the level achieved in the same
period of 1985/86.
    Telecommunications orders remained at roughly the same
level.
    Kaske said investments were expected to remain around six
billion marks in 1986/87 after a 50 pct increase the previous
year. Research and development were likely to rise 13 pct to
6.1 billion marks or around 12 pct of turnover.

<TITLE>KRUPP HAS SATISFACTORY 1986 RESULTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ESSEN, West Germany, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Fried. Krupp GmbH
&lt;KRPG.D> steel and engineering group said it had a satisfactory
1986 despite a provisional 12 pct fall in total group sales to
18.1 billion marks from 20.7 billion the previous year.
    Third party turnover declined to 15.9 billion from 18.5
billion in 1985 while orders slipped to 15.5 billion marks from
16.9 billion, it said in a preliminary statement.
    Despite these figures, which reflected the dollar's
weakness against the mark and oil and raw materials price
falls, it said 1986 was a satisfactory year.
    The reason was the continued expansion of the machinery and
plant sector, which accounted for 42 pct of total sales.
    Krupp added that some areas of the mechanical engineering
business achieved notable growth rates and acquisitions had
underpinned machinery and component activities.
    An orders decline in the steel and, in particular, the
trading and services sectors, affected the group's total order
figures.
    However, "all business sectors contributed to the positive
results achieved in 1986," Krupp added, without giving details.
    Domestic orders decreased by five pct to 9.6 billion marks
from the previous year and foreign orders fell 14 pct to 5.9
billion, it said. Foreign business accounted for 38 pct of
orders against 40 pct in 1985.
    Orders received by the machinery and plant sector, 11
member companies which comprise the core area of the group,
rose by four mln marks last year to 6.9 billion, Krupp said.
    The group's orders in hand amounted to 9.1 billion marks at
end-December 1986 from 10.3 billion at the start of the year.
    Orders received by the steel sector last year decreased by
three pct to 6.2 billion marks from 1985, it said.
    The steel market weakened increasingly over the year,
mainly because of exchange rate movements, the deterioration in
foreign trade and a downturn in a number of customer
industries.
    The difficult market for sections and flats of quality
steel depressed order tonnages by around seven pct, Krupp said.
But special steel boosted by strong demand for stainless
cold-rolled flats, grew by five pct in tonnage terms.

<TITLE>NO PESSIMISM FOR GERMAN EXPORTERS, MINISTRY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Firms need not be pessimistic about export
prospects even though foreign markets have become more
difficult because of the mark's strength the Economics Ministry
said.
     The ministry's parliamentary state secretary Ludolf Georg
von Wartenberg, told a business conference German exports could
start rising again in real terms during 1987, reversing the
lower export trend which emerged in mid-1986.
    But even if the turnaround did not occur, there would be no
need to worry about the economy as long as the weakness of
exports did not affect currently good domestic demand.
    Von Wartenberg said consumer demand remained quite good but
noted there had been a cooling in the investment climate. "This
is certainly a reason for heightened watchfulness but not for
stimulative steps," he said.
    The best way for Bonn to help its exporters is to work
actively to promote free world trade, he added.
    Von Wartenberg said the economy still had good export
opportunities. Price alone was not the only factor in
international competitiveness, he said, adding German firms
have a reputation for high quality standards, prompt delivery
times and good service.
    Von Wartenberg said the government was in a difficult
position on its trade figures.  It faced international pressure
to reduce its trade surplus, but West Germans were worried
about the effect of the mark's strength on the country's
exporters.
    Reports about the trade surplus, especially overseas,
tended to concentrate on nominal trade figures, which rose to a
record 112.2 billion marks in 1986, he said. But this rise was
due entirely to the lower value of imports caused by the
decline of both the dollar and oil prices. German exports have
in fact been falling in real terms for sometime, he said.

<TITLE>MONETARY AUTHORITIES SAID TO LOSE CREDIBILITY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Etsuko Yamamoto, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The monetary authorities of the major
industrialised countries lost their credibility this week as
the dollar was sold off despite pleas from ministers and
widespread central bank intervention, dealers said.
    The dollar's fall below 150 yen, which follows last month's
Paris currency stabilisation agreement by the U.S., Japan, West
Germany, Britain, France and Canada, is a dramatic reversal of
the success of the Group of Five (G-5) 1985 New York Plaza
meeting to weaken the dollar, they said.
    The G-5 and the market agreed in 1985 that the dollar was
overvalued but this time the market and the authorities are on
different sides, dealers said.
    Apparent confusion in the ranks of the G-5 nations has
encouraged the market to challenge the authorities despite
concerted intervention by the central banks of the United
States, Japan, Britain and West Germany, they said.
    Pleas by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa for
action to stabilise the dollar were matched over the weekend by
comments by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that there was
no target zone for the dollar. The dollar was sold anyway.
    Yesterday's comment by Baker that he stood by the Paris
accord did nothing to reverse sentiment, dealers said.
    The intervention, backed by remarks by Fed Chairman Paul
Volcker and Japanese central bank governor Satoshi Sumita,
which a few months ago would have brought the dollar fall to a
halt, has done little but slow the rate of its decline, they
noted.
    The situation has again raised the question of whether
intervention can succeed against the trend in today's huge
currency markets. Dealers said the market's cool response to
intervention reflected a basic oversupply of dollars.
    "This means that the current dollar selling is not of a
sheer speculative nature but backed by real demand," said Koichi
Miyazaki, deputy general manager at Sanwa Bank.
    Dealers said the dollar will remain weak despite the
intervention and it is only a matter of time before some
operators try to push it below 148 yen. The dollar closed in
Tokyo today at 149.40 against New York's 149.30/40. Its record
low was 148.40 in Tokyo last Tuesday.
    Dealers said the dollar will gain only temporary support to
rise above 150 yen toward early April when the Group of Seven
industrial nations meets to discuss currencies again.
    The market expects the seven nations (the Paris six plus
Italy) to try to agree on another way to stabilise currencies
apart from intervention, a chief dealer at a U.S. Bank said.
    Dealers said they were unsure what other methods could be
used and they are sceptical anyway about how long the Paris
accord nations, particulary the U.S., Will remain willing to
prevent a further dollar fall given the continuing high U.S.
Trade deficit, especially with Japan.
    Further pressure from a protectionist U.S. Congress for a
lower dollar is also limiting Washington's options, they said.
    The market now thinks the central bank action is to slow
the dollar fall, not to push it back over 150 yen, said
Tadahiko Nashimoto, manager at Long Term Credit Bank of Japan.
    Another bearish factor for the dollar is expected large
forward dollar sales from April to June for export bills
falling due for Japanese exporters from April to September.
    The exporters had delayed in expectation of a further yen
depreciation, dealers said.
    Yesterday's request to 30 trading houses by the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry to restrict dollar sales looks
ineffective in light of this real demand, they said.
    The market is also anticipating active institutional dollar
sales to hedge currency risks on bond holdings from the new
business year starting April 1, dealers said.
    "The market seems to have established a new dollar trading
range between 147 and 149 yen," one dealer said.
    The dollar traded between 151 and 153 yen after the Paris
accord on February 22 and 150 yen was then considered the low
end for the dollar against the yen, he said.
    Some dealers now believe that if the dollar falls below 148
yen, it will pick up renewed downward momentum and slide to
145.

<TITLE>MALAYSIAN CENTRAL BANK SEES HIGHER 1987 GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KUALA LUMPUR, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Gross domestic product (GDP)
growth in 1987 is expected to grow by between 1.5 and two pct,
up from one pct in 1986, the central bank said.
    The forecast compares with the one pct GDP growth forecast
made by the Treasury last October.
    Bank Negara also said in its annual report that gross
national product (GNP) is expected to grow by 3.5 to four pct,
after declining 7.3 pct in 1986.
    It said that a turnaround in investor confidence since last
November had been spurred by a moderate improvement in oil and
commodity prices and a rise in manufacturing exports.
    Growth in 1987 is expected to come from the anticipated
rise in export earnings if the industrialised countries sustain
their average GNP growth at 2.5 to three pct, it added.
    Bank Negara said its forecast assumes that crude oil will
average 15.50 dlrs a barrel, rubber at 210 cents a kilo, palm
oil at 850 ringgit a tonne, tin at 17 ringgit a kilo and a rise
of 12 pct in manufacturing exports.
    It said Malaysia's international terms of trade will turn
around to rise by two pct in 1987 after declining 12 pct in
1986 and five pct in 1985.
    "In 1987, income will be higher, private consumer spending
is likely to recover and expand... The budget will remain under
strict control... The resource gap in the government's finances
on current account will be bridged over the near term," Bank
Governor Jaafar Hussein said in the report.
    The current account deficit is expected to narrow to 1.19
billion ringgit in 1986 or 1.8 pct of GNP from 1.79 billion or
2.5 pct of the GNP the previous year.
    The bank forecasts the inflation rate will increase by 1.5
pct, after its 0.7 pct rise in 1986.

<TITLE>U.K. VISIBLE TRADE DEFICIT NARROWS IN FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Britain's visible trade deficit narrowed
to a seasonally adjusted provisional 224 mln stg in February
from 527 mln in January, The Trade and Industry Department
said.
    The current account balance of payments in February showed
a seasonally adjusted provisional surplus of 376 mln stg
compared with a surplus of 73 mln in January.
    Invisibles in February were put provisionally at a 600 mln
surplus, the same as in January.
    Seasonally adjusted, imports rose in February to 7.16
billion stg from 6.73 billion in January. Exports rose to a
record 6.93 billion last month from 6.20 billion in January.
    Trade Department officials said the improvement in
Britain's current account contrasted with most private
forecasts and they attributed much of the strength to imports
rising less quickly in February than might otherwise have been
expected.
    The Department said exceptionally cold weather in January
reduced exports that month and that there had been an element
of catching up in the February figures.
    The seasonally adjusted volume index, base 1980, a guide to
underlying non-oil trade, showed exports rising to 131.0 from
114.6 in January and imports rising to 142.2 from 136.5.
    The value of British oil exports in February rose to 751
mln stg from 723 mln in Jnauary while oil imports rose to 425
mln from 352 mln.
    The Department said the upward trend in non-oil export
volume continues and the underlying level of non-oil import
volume seems to have stablised.
    The Departnment said exports to the U.S. May be benefiting
from fluctuations in the mark and yen exchange rates.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Lucas Industries Plc &lt;LUCS.L> said its
underlying performance would continue to improve in the second
half but profits would be restrained by low activity in U.K.
Commercial vehicle and tractor markets as well as in North
American electronics.
    The company earlier reported a two mln stg rise in pretax
profit to 40 mln in the six months to end-January. The figure
was some five mln below forecasts and Lucas shares dropped
sharply to 557.5p at 1130 GMT from last night's close of 590p.
    It said it would continue with plans for all its activities
to be internationally competitive and profitable.
    Costs of restructuring, reorganisation, employee training
and retraining, particularly in the UK automotive businesses,
together with high research and development spending would
affect profits in the short term.
    But Lucas said it was exploiting growth opportunities in
automotive markets, especially in vehicle breaking and engine
management systems. Recent acquisitions in North America had
strengthened Lucas Aerospace and Lucas Industrial systems.

said it is in Japan's national interest to make greater efforts
to reduce its trade surplus.
    He told business executives the most important issues for
the world economy are the correction of international trade
imbalances and a solution to the world debt problem.
    To this end, Japan and the U.S. Must make medium- and
long-term efforts to alter economic structures which have
expanded the trade gap between the two nations. World economic
growth and therefore an expansion of debtor countries' export
markets are needed to solve the debt issue, he added.

<TITLE>IWC LIFTS WORLD GRAIN OUTPUT ESTIMATE TO RECORD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The International Wheat Council (IWC)
lifted its estimate for 1986/87 world wheat and coarse grain
production by one mln tonnes to a record 1,377 mln, compared
with 1,351 mln tonnes the previous season.
    In its monthly market report, the IWC said it is leaving
unchanged its forecast of world wheat production for the coming
1987/88 season at between 520 and 530 mln tonnes against a
record 534 mln in 1986/87. The one mln tonne upward revision in
1986/87 wheat production reflects several minor adjustments.
The IWC raised the 1986/87 coarse grain trade figure two mln to
87 mln tonnes. It left wheat trade unchanged at 86 mln.
    The IWC 1986/87 estimate for world trade in wheat and
coarse grain is thus estimated two mln tonnes higher at 173 mln
against 169 mln the previous season with the forecast three mln
rise in Soviet imports offset by small reductions elsewhere.
    The IWC said the area harvested for wheat in 1987/88 is
likely to be down from last year as low world prices and
restrictive national policies measures begin to take effect.
    At least four of the five major exporters expect to see a
drop in wheat sowings without offset in other countries. There
is still potential for even higher average wheat yields but the
IWC said there are increasing signs world output may level off.
    Although it is still early to assess the coarse grain
outlook, the IWC said barley acreage is likely to fall in the
European Community but increase in Canada. U.S. Maize area is
expected lower but oat sowings could rise.
    After damage to its maize crop last year, the Soviet Union
plans to expand this area by as much as 50 pct to over six mln
hectares in a year when many frost damaged wheat fields are
likely to be resown to this and other spring crops. Improved
weather and a further increase in the use of intensive
cultivation methods could therefore see a marked rise in Soviet
maize output in 1987, the IWC said.
    Any reduction in world coarse grain output would be
bolstered by the large carryover stocks from 1986/87, the IWC
said.
    It left its estimates of wheat and coarse grain stocks at
end&#127;of different marketing years unchanged at 178 and 210 mln
tonnes, respectively, against 160 and 167 mln a year earlier.
    After record world durum wheat production of 218.8 mln
tonnes last season, the IWC said there are already signs of
another large crop this coming season with higher output
expected in the EC, Canada, the U.S. And North Africa.

<TITLE>U.K. TRADE FIGURES BUOY HOPES OF INTEREST RATE CUT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rowena Whelan, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The release of U.K. February trade data
showing that the current account surplus was a provisional 376
mln stg, up from a 73 mln surplus in January, has boosted hopes
of an early cut in interest rates, analysts said.
    Market forecasts had been for a worse outcome, with
expectations of a deficit in visible trade averaging about 750
mln stg, against the official figure of 224 mln stg, sharply
narrower than January's 527 mln deficit.
    "The figures are unreservedly good," Chase Manhattan
Securities economist Andrew Wroblewski said.
    Sterling rebounded on the trade figures, reversing a weaker
morning trend, to stand at 72.1 pct of its trade weighted index
against a basket of currencies at midday, unchanged from
yesterday's close but 0.3 points above the 1100 GMT level.
    The market had feared that a deteriorating non-oil trade
pattern would undermine international support for sterling,
which has been the motor behind the recent fall in U.K.
Interest rates. Money market sources said the market had begun
to doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending rates
to 9.5 pct from the present 10.0 pct was really on the cards.
    But sentiment now looks to have turned about again.
    There now looks to be no danger that the Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson's forecast of a 1987 current account
deficit of 2.5 billion stg will be exceeded, Wroblewski said.
    Seasonally adjusted figures showed imports rose in February
to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January.
    Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion from 6.20 billion.
    However, Chris Tinker, U.K. Analyst at brokers Phillips and
Drew said the faster rise in exports than imports would prove
partly aberrational in coming months. He forecast the
Chancellor's Budget tax cuts would increase consumer
expenditure on imported goods.
    However, Warburg Securities economist Ian Harwood said his
firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficit
forecast in the light of the latest data, cutting one billion
stg off the expected full year total to about 1.75 billion stg.
    He said news of strong growth in exports of non-oil goods
confirmed recent bullish surveys among members of the
Confederation of British Industry.
    The growth in imports appears to be flattening, even if
January's bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseas
goods and import-intensive stock building among manufacturers,
Harwood said.
    U.K. Government bonds, or gilts, surged by more than 1/2
point on the better-than-expected news, as earlier worries
about the figures evaporated.
    Sterling peaked at a high of 1.6075 dlrs, before settling
to a steady 1.6050 about 1300 GMT, nearly a cent higher than
the European low of 1.5960.
    However, analysts noted that the turnabout in market
sentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news.
    Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was
largely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that the
Conservative government's support was slipping.
    LONDON, March 26 - The Bank of England said it provided 15
mln stg in assistance to the money market this morning, buying
bank bills in band two at 9-13/16 pct.
    Earlier the Bank revised its money market liquidity
forecast from a flat position to a deficit of around 350 mln
stg.

<TITLE>WORLD BANK CHIEF CONCERNED ABOUT BRAZIL ECONOMY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>World Bank president Barber Conable said
he was concerned about the state of Brazil's economy and urged
the country to come up with a plan soon to put its economic
house in order.
    "I am very concerned about the Brazilian economy," he told
reporters after a news conference in Tokyo.
    He said Brazil had caught the attention of the world with
its decision last month to stop paying interest on its loans
from commercial banks but warned it not to sqaunder the time it
gained by failing to come up with a new economic program.
    Brazil's decision jolted the world's financial community as
the country is 108 billion dlrs in debt, including some 68
billion owed to commercial banks.
    Brazilian Finance Ministry sources said in Brasilia
yesterday that the country was preparing a new economic
strategy designed to ensure domestic economic growth.
    Despite mounting domestic and overseas pressure, Brazil has
said repeatedly that it will not go to the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) for help in drawing up a new plan for fear
that will only throw its economy into recession.
    Conable said the country may be able to get away with not
going to the IMF for help, but will need an IMF-type economic
program if it wants to regain the confidence of lenders.
    Outsiders like the World Bank are reluctant to suggest
possible solutions to Brazil's economic problems because of the
delicate political situation there, he added.
    While the World Bank has a role to play in helping Brazil,
it can&#127;ot replace the IMF as an overseer of the economy,
Conable said. He added that the Fund can be very flexible in
its dealings with developing countries, adjusting its approach
to the political realities.
    Brazil still seems willing to talk to the Fund under the
annual discussions that all IMF members undertake, Conable
said, adding that this could partially solve the current
stalemate.
    During his news conference, Conable said the World Bank
backed U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's Third World debt
initiative, which calls for stepped up lending to heavily
indebted Third World countries adopting economic policies.
    "The World Bank believes the Baker initiative is the best
approach," he said. "Debt forgiveness is difficult to design in
any fair way and also will tend to discourage further
investment and development."
    He cited the recent multi-billion dollar debt package for
Mexico, the Third World's most indebted country after Brazil.
    "Will it work?" he asked. "We don't know...But we think it
more likely to work than any of the alternatives suggested."
    Conable, who is here to meet government and business
leaders, expressed confidence that Japan will make increasing
use of its huge trade surplus to help developing countries.
    "We are quite confident Japan will make an increasing
investment in development because of their willingness to
support institutions like ours in increasing ways with each
passing year," he said.

<DATELINE>    ROME, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Italian Treasury said it would offer
an undetermined amount of 10-year variable-coupon certificates
(CCTs) at a rate unchanged on that of the preceding offer in
late February.
    The Treasury said that, unlike the previous offer, the
amount had not been prefixed. It would be in line with market
demand unless this was considered excessive.
    The CCTs will be priced at 99.00 pct for an effective net
annual yield on the first coupon, payable April 1, 1988, of
9.85 pct.
    Subsequent yields on the certificates will be calculated by
adding 0.75 point to average rates on short-term Treasury
bills.
    Subscriptions to the issue open April 1 and are scheduled
to close April 7.
    The Treasury said it reserved the right to close the issue
early.

<TITLE>CURRENCY EXCHANGE LOSS PUSHES MALAYSIA'S DEBT UP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KUALA LUMPUR, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>An exchange loss of 7.6 billion
ringgit in 1986 pushed Malaysia's outstanding external debt up
to 50.99 billion ringgit, from 1985's 42.3 billion, the Central
Bank said in its annual report.
    Bank Negara said although Malaysia's net borrowing dropped
in 1986, its external debt rose due to the 30 pct appreciation
of the basket of currencies against which the ringgit is
pegged.
    The basket comprises principally the U.S. Dollar, yen,
mark, Swiss franc, French franc, sterling, guilder, Canadian
and Singapore dollars, it added.
    Bank Negara said growth in external debt, which declined
progressively from a peak of 58 pct in 1982 to 13.6 pct in
1985, rose by 20.2 pct in 1986.
    Malaysia's debt serving ratio of 17.6 pct of its exports in
1986 is within the prudency limit of 20 pct, Bank Negara
Governor Jaafar Hussein told reporters.

<TITLE>IWC SAYS EFFECT OF LOWER SUPPORT PRICES LIMITED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Efforts by governments to control wheat
surpluses by cutting support prices have met with only partial
success, the International Wheat Council (IWC) says in its
latest monthly report.
    Faster results could be achieved by a policy of reducing
both price and areas, as employed in the United States, the IWC
says in a survey of support prices in the five main wheat
exporters - Argentina, Australia, Canada, the EC and the U.S.
    In some countries, for example Australia and Argentina,
which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for export
income, there may be problems in reducing production.
    A policy of cutting wheat production could lead to
unemployment, with job prospects outside agriculture limited.
Alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could then
lead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems.
    The IWC outlines three courses of action open to
governments in wheat exporting countries.
    They could continue to support prices in the hope that when
the world economy improves demand for wheat will rise and
surpluses wil be reduced or eliminated.
    Alternatively, support could be limited to wheat which
could be easily sold, without needing to be stored for a long
period.
    This option may prove to be the most politically
unattractive and would result in many producers abandoning
wheat production, the report said.
    The third option would be for governments to distinguish
between the commercial and social aspects of agriculture,
possibly varying support prices according to farm size or
overall production.
    The IWC review covers support prices in the major exporting
countries since 1982. At some time during that period all the
producers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses.
    These changes did not always result in lower export
subsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations more
than offset lower prices in the domestic currency.
    For example between 1985/86 and 1986/87 the EC intervention
price for bread wheat fell from 209.30 to 179.44 European
currency units (Ecus). It dollar terms, the currency in which
most export transactions are denominated, the intervention
price however rose to 193 dlrs from 168. The high cost of
supporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequers
and some governments are now searching for ways to cut
expenditure, the report says.
    The proportion of world wheat output produced by the five
major exporters declined in the period covered by the survey
from 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987. This was partly due to
increased production in China and India.
    The period saw an upward trend in yields, although this was
countered in the Argentina, the U.S. And Australia by lower
acreages.
    In Argentina a reduction in the sown area of about 20 per
cent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch to
other enterprises, particularly livestock while lower U.S.
Acreages are attributed to official incentives.

<TITLE>U.S. TREASURY'S BAKER OPPOSES TAX INCREASE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker
said that he opposes a Federal tax increase to help reduce the
budget deficit and favors spending cuts instead.
    "I don't think it's (a tax increase) is a very good idea
and I'm quite confident that President Reagan doesn't think
it's a very good idea," Baker said in an interview on Cable
News Network's "Moneyline" television program.
    He said U.S. taxpayers are taxed at a rate of 19 pct of GNP
which is traditionally where it has been, but the Federal
Government is spending at a rate of 24 pct of GNP. Baker said
spending cuts are clearly the best way to cut budget deficits.
    Baker said he opposed a stock transactions tax proposed by
House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Tex, or other special taxes.
    "The stock transfer tax would be a particularly unfortunate
approach to take," the Treasury Secretary said. He said the
United States has some of the most efficient capital markets in
the world and new taxes would impair efficiency.
    On the international front, Baker said banks must do more
lending to developing countries. He was questioned about this
after the Standard and Poor's Corp downgrading today of the
debt of six major money center bank holding companies, largely
because of their heavy developing nation loan exposure.
    Baker said that developing countries must adopt free market
economic policies such as in the United States. He said capital
flows will be required to support the needed reforms in the
economic systems of those countries.
    The money must come either through equity or debt and Baker
said that developing nations' "investment regimes do not
support enough equity investment, so you've got to have some
debt there."
    Commenting on the U.S. trade deficit, Baker said "I think
you're going to see a 15 to 20 billion dlr reduction this
year."

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>PHILIPPINE DEBT TALKS PROCEED WITH NARROWER FOCUS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The latest round of talks between
Philippine officials and the country's commercial bank
creditors on the rescheduling of 9.4 billion dlrs worth of debt
are still proceeding, but with a narrower focus, Philippine
Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin said.
    He told a press briefing Wednesday that Manila has dropped
a two-tier interest payment offer, which would have given banks
a higher return if they took partial payment in new Philippine
investment notes (PINs) instead of in cash.
    "The PINs proposal has been laid aside.... The discussion is
now on pricing (of just the cash payments)," he said.
    Foreign banking sources in Manila said on Tuesday that the
Philippines had raised its basic interest rate offer to 7/8
over the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) but Ongpin would
not discuss details of the pricing negotiations.
    He also refused to speculate on when an overall agreement
might be reached. The talks have been going on for more than
three weeks.
    Manila originally offered to pay interest in cash at 5/8
over LIBOR or in a mixture of cash and PINs -- tradeable,
dollar-denominated, zero coupon notes that could potentially
yield up to one point over LIBOR.
    The PINs option was subsequently modified to guarantee at
least a 7/8 point spread over LIBOR but many bankers still had
grave reservations, seeing it as a possible precedent for other
large debtors to avoid paying interest in cash.
    The PINs proposal has now been left on the table as a
separate option for those banks, which might want to fund their
own investments in the Philippines or sell the notes in the
secondary market, Ongpin said.
    Under Manila's plan, the PINs would be redeemable at full
face value in Philippine pesos to fund local equity investments
at any time prior to their six-year maturity date.
    While the commercial banks had their doubts about the PINs
proposal, Ongpin said there was great interest on the part of
certain investment banks which are already active in the
secondary market for sovereign debt.
    Unlike current debt/equity schemes, Ongpin said, the PINs
would include no government fees and would be free from
"administrative hassles."
    He said about six investment banks had been approached and
four had replied so far. One even showed interest in buying 45
mln dlrs worth of notes, he said.
    Ongpin said that by funding current interest payments in
the secondary market through the PINs scheme, the Philippines
could conserve at least one to 1.5 billion dlrs of foreign
exchange reserves during its planned seven-year restructuring
period.

<TITLE>TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS HE STANDS BY PARIS PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker said
he stood by the Paris agreement among leading industrial
nations to foster exchange rate stability around current
levels.
    "I would refer you to the Paris agreement which was a
recognition the currencies were within ranges broadly
consistent with economic fundamentals," Baker told The Cable
News Network in an interview.
    "We were quite satisfied with the agreement in Paris
otherwise we would not have been a party too it," he said.
    Baker also noted the nations agreed in the accord to
"co-operate to foster greater exchange rate stability around
those levels."
    He refused to comment directly on the current yen/dollar
rate but said flatly that foreign exchange markets recently
tended "to draw unwarranted inferences from what I say."
    Baker was quoted on British Television over the weekend as
saying he has no target for the U.S. currency, a statement that
triggered this week's renewed decline of the dollar.
    "I think the Paris agreement represents evidence that
international economic policy co-ordination is alive and well,"
Baker said.
    The Treasury Secretary stressed however it was very
important for the main surplus countries to grow as fast as
they could consistent with low inflation to resolve trade
imbalances.
    He added that Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker
has also "been very outspoken" in suggesting main trading
partners grow as fast as they can.

<TITLE>GERMAN ANALYSTS SEE GOLD RISING IN 2ND HALF 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The price of gold bullion is likely
to rise in the second half of the year on increased private
investor demand, West German analysts said.
    Gold could rise as high as 500 dlrs per ounce later this
year, said Peter Witte, director of Westdeutsche Landesbank
Girozentrale's trading division, after a presentation by the
U.S. Mint to promote its gold and silver Eagle series coins.
    "A lot will depend on oil prices and developments on stock
exchanges," Witte said, adding he saw gold positioned for
further rises once it breaks out above 450 dlrs.
    Gold was fixed this morning in London at 411.30 dlrs.
    Despite current strong interest in gold mine stocks, many
investors still want to buy physical gold, Witte said.
    Interest in gold mine stocks may also wane if stock
exchange rallies under way in many countries start to waver.
    Hermann Strohmeyer, vice president of Commerzbank AG's
foreign exchange trading and treasury department, said gold is
poised to rise to 460 to 470 dlrs an ounce in the second half
of this year.
    The price is unlikely to fall much below 380 or 390 dlrs an
ounce, and probably will continue in a range between 380 and
430 dlrs in the first half of this year, he said.

    Pinola said First Interstate, like other banks, has not yet
decided to put the loans, which Brazil stopped paying interest
on last month, on non-accrual status.
    "None of us really wants to injure negotiations that might
be going on," he said.
    First Interstate reported to the Securities and Exchange
Commission last week that it has about 339 mln dlrs in
medium-to long-term loans to Brazil.
    It said on December 31, 1986 its nonperformind Brazilian
outstanding debt totaled about 4.1 mln dlrs.
    First Interstate also has about 168 mln dlrs in short-term
loans or trade lines to Brazil.
    Pinola said he believes the solution to the Brazilian debt
crisis will be more political than economic, which he said he
finds, "very disquieting and discomforting."

<TITLE>BAKER SEES 15 TO 20 BILLION DLR DROP IN TRADE GAP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker said
he expected the U.S. Trade deficit to fall by 15 billion to 20
billion dlrs in 1987.
    Commenting on the deficit during an interview on Cable News
Network, Baker said "I think you're going to see a 15 to 20
billion dlr reduction this year." The deficit was 170 billion
dlrs in 1986.
    Baker noted that the benefits of a weaker currency take 12
to 18 months to affect the trade balance, and said it is now 18
months since the Plaza agreement to lower the dollar's value.

<TITLE>U.K. VISIBLE TRADE DEFICIT NARROWS IN FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Britain's visible trade deficit narrowed
to a seasonally adjusted provisional 224 mln stg in February
from 527 mln in January, The Trade and Industry Department
said.
    The current account balance of payments in February showed
a seasonally adjusted provisional surplus of 376 mln stg
compared with a surplus of 73 mln in January.
    Invisibles in February were put provisionally at a 600 mln
surplus, the same as in January.
    Seasonally adjusted, imports rose in February to 7.16
billion stg from 6.73 billion in January. Exports rose to a
record 6.93 billion last month from 6.20 billion in January.
    Trade Department officials said the improvement in
Britain's current account contrasted with most private
forecasts and they attributed much of the strength to imports
rising less quickly in February than might otherwise have been
expected.
    The Department said exceptionally cold weather in January
reduced exports that month and that there had been an element
of catching up in the February figures.
    The seasonally adjusted volume index, base 1980, a guide to
underlying non-oil trade, showed exports rising to 131.0 from
114.6 in January and imports rising to 142.2 from 136.5.
    The value of British oil exports in February rose to 751
mln stg from 723 mln in Jnauary while oil imports rose to 425
mln from 352 mln.

<TITLE>FRENCH RESERVES FALL ON DEBT REPAYMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>French reserves fell in the week ended
March 19 following repayment of the bulk of the debt contracted
during January with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund, the
Bank of France said in its weekly statement.
    The repayment of capital and interest on this loan, taken
out during the strong pressure on the franc which preceded the
European Monetary System (EMS) realignment and the subsequent
Group of Five meeting in Paris, took place on March 13.
    It comprised the repayment of 11.25 billion francs' worth
of European Currency Units (ECUs), 9.72 billion francs' worth
of foreign currency and 1.72 billion francs' worth of special
drawing rights (SDRs), the Bank said.
    As a result foreign currency reserves fell to 114.69
billion francs on March 19 from 120.82 billion on March 12,
while ECU reserves fell to 62.02 billion francs from 73.23
billion.
    Gold reserves remained stable at 218.32 billion francs.

<DATELINE>    EXTON, Pa., March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Foote Mineral Co said it has signed
a letter of intent to merge into &lt;Rio Tinto-Zinc Corp PLC> for
cash.
    The company said at the time of the acquisition, its assets
will include only lithium and ferrosilicon operations. Foote,
which is 83 pct owned by Newmont Mining Corp &lt;NEM>, has signed
a letter of intent to sell its Cambridge operations and said it
is in talks on the sale of its manganese operations with
several companies.  Foote said Newmont has informally indicated
it would vote in favor of the Rio Tinto proposal.
    Foote said terms of the agreement, including price for the
proposed cash transaction, have not been released because they
are subject to a continuing due diligence investigation.
    The company said a definitive merger agreement is expected
to be negotiated within six weeks and shareholders are expected
to vote on the deal at a meeting expected to be held in June or
July.

<TITLE>BRITISH BANKS RESIST SIGNING MEXICO PACKAGE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Marguerite Nugent, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>British banks are resisting signing a 76
billion dlr rescheduling package for Mexico in a last ditch
effort to get all participants to contribute equally to a new
7.7 billion dlr loan contained in the package.
    Christopher Brougham, regional manager, rescheduling unit,
at Lloyds Bank Plc, said in response to a Reuter enquiry, that
the six major U.K. Clearing banks last week sent a telex to
Citibank saying they would contribute what was requested
provided all other major lenders did the same and that the U.S.
Banks contribute at least 90 pct of the amount required by
them.
    Other bankers, who declined to be identified, said other
groups of banks particularly those in Switzerland, France and
Canada, were equally reluctant to sign, although they had not
sent any telex to Citibank, which chairs Mexico's 13-bank
advisory group.
    However, they said it was likely that if and when the
British banks sign the accord, the others are likely to follow.
    Under the agreement, for which the signing began on Friday,
commercial banks are being asked to contribute 12.9 pct of
their exposure to Mexico as of August 1982. That was the date
of the first Mexican debt crisis.
    After months of haggling, a proposed rescheduling agreement
for Mexico was struck last September during the annual meeting
of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in
Washington.
    Ever since then the advisory group, of which Lloyds is a
member, has been attempting to round up the needed signatories.
    However, there has been considerable resistance to the
package, partly because of some of the clauses it contains and
partly because many small U.S. Regional banks do not want to
increase their exposure to any Latin American countries.
    Brougham said, "We (British banks) have always played along
for Mexico and will do so as long as others share equally."
    The decision to send the telexes was agreed on by the six
clearers jointly, but each sent its own telex.
    In addition to Lloyds, telexes were sent by National
Westminster Bank Plc, Barclays Bank Plc, Midland Bank Plc,
&#127;tandard Chartered Bank Plc and Royal Bank of Scotland Plc.
    Brougham noted that so far the U.S. Banks have only reached
83-1/2 pct of the total that is expected from them, while the
level of contributions from the U.K. Banks is well in excess of
90 pct. "The U.S. Figure should be closer to ours," he said.
    Many bankers have been angered by the resistance of the
regional U.S. Banks, noting that even if they don't contribute
to the new loan they still will be receiving interest on the
existing loans.
    The banks still have three weeks to sign the agreement and
bankers are hoping all will go according to plan.
    In the meantime, bankers expect further pressure will be
exercised on the regional banks and the major U.S. Banks to
find a solution to the problem. Many have suggested that the
larger U.S. Banks should take on the additional obligations,
but so far they have resisted this.
    Bankers expect that much of the pressure on the U.S. Banks
will come from U.S. Regulators, notably the Federal Reserve.
    Bankers prefer to view the stance taken by the British
banks and other national groups as "a matter of principal, and
burden sharing" rather than as a "pressure tactic" to force the
U.S. Banks to make up their share.
    The bankers are not the only ones to be upset by the
protracted negotiations surrounding the agreement.
    The Mexicans themselves have been angered by the delays. At
the signing in New York last Friday, Finance Minister Gustavo
Petricioli sounded a warning to the recalcitrant banks.
    "Those who supported us today can be sure that Mexico will
continue to be open and willing to share with them the business
opportunities which its future growth will create," Petricioli
said.
    Conversion of bank debt into equity investments in Mexico
is one option banks can take advantage of to reduce their
exposure. But Mexico halted its debt for equity program in
February in an effort to concentrate on finalising the package.
    On Friday, Petricioli said "We will be a lot more
expeditious in processing the requests of banks that have
supported us."
    The pressure on the U.S. Banks comes at a time when other
major Latin American debtors are in the process of crucial debt
negotiations.
    Brazil, the third world's largest debtor, has suspended all
interest payments on its 109 billion dlrs of foreign debt. Many
of the major U.S. Banks, including Citibank, have already said
they might have to put their Brazil loans on a cash basis and
take the financial losses, which could total billions of
dollars.
    This would be required by U.S. Banking regulations if the
interest payments are more than 90 days overdue.
    However, the U.S. Banks are not the only ones threatened by
regulations. In the U.K., A proposed Inland Revenue ruling
would affect the tax treatment of certain types of loans, many
of which are made to Latin American countries.
    Basically, the ruling wants to limit the tax credit a bank
can claim for tax withheld by foreign governments on loan
interest payments.
    The British banks are planning to fight the proposals as
their implementation could prove extremely costly, not just in
terms of compliance but in limiting future business.

<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hong Kong recorded a 3.51 billion
H.K. Dlr deficit in February after a 2.54 billion dlr surplus
in January as imports climbed and exports slid, the Census and
Statistics Department said.
    The deficit compared with a deficit of 1.76 billion dlrs in
February 1986.
    Imports rose to 24.12 billion dlrs, up 2.6 pct from
January's 23.52 billion dlrs and 42 pct above the 16.98 billion
dlrs recorded in February 1986.
    Total exports for the month fell 20.9 pct to 20.61 billion

    February exports were still 35.4 pct above the 15.22
billion dlrs recorded in the same month last year.
    Re-exports, the territory's traditional entrepot trade,
outpaced domestically produced exports for the first time since
March 1985.
    Re-exports fell 11.6 pct to 10.62 billion dlrs from 12.0
billion dlrs in January but were 54 pct above February 1986's
6.88 billion dlrs. Domestic exports slid 28.9 pct to 9.99

<TITLE>BANK OF SPAIN PROVIDES YEAR RECORD ASSISTANCE FUNDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MADRID, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Spain provided 1,145 billion
pesetas in assistance funds which bankers said reflected fears
of fresh increases in overnight rates.
    The daily auction was the biggest of the year and comes
after the previous record set last June 6 of 1,240 billion
pesetas.
    A spokesman for one of Spain top five banks said higher
overnight call money rates were expected in the short term in
view of disappointing money supply figures for February.
    The M-4 money supply, measured as liquid assets in public
hands, rose 16.7 pct last month against 8.1 pct in January and
compared with this year's eight pct target. Money supply growth
was 11.4 pct last year.
    The central bank on Tuesday raised overnight rates by a
quarter of a percentage point to 14 pct on demand for 746
billion pesetas. Rates stood at 12.1 pct at the start of the
year and have been increased to drain liquidity on rising
demand for funds. "The policy is proving counter-productive and
rates will have to come down in the long-term," the bank
spokesman said in reply to Reuters enquiries.
    He said higher rates were fuelling an influx of short-term
speculative capital from abroad.
    "At least 800 mln dlrs of current excess liquidity in the
system is convertible pesetas from West Germany and other
countries with much lower rates," he said.

sanctions against Japan to force Tokyo to open its domestic

    The government announced last week that Japan had a 5.9

    The Department of Trade and Industry said the government
was drawing up contingency plans to force Japan into opening up
its domestic markets but a spokesman said such moves were very

    Ideas being considered included blocking Japanese companies
from trading in Britain and revoking licenses of Japanese

<TITLE>U.K. TRADE FIGURES BUOY HOPES OF INTEREST RATE CUT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rowena Whelan, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The release of U.K. February trade data
showing that the current account surplus was a provisional 376
mln stg, up from a 73 mln surplus in January, has boosted hopes
of an early cut in interest rates, analysts said.
    Market forecasts had been for a worse outcome, with
expectations of a deficit in visible trade averaging about 750
mln stg, against the official figure of 224 mln stg, sharply
narrower than January's 527 mln deficit.
    "The figures are unreservedly good," Chase Manhattan
Securities economist Andrew Wroblewski said.
    Sterling rebounded on the trade figures, reversing a weaker
morning trend, to stand at 72.1 pct of its trade weighted index
against a basket of currencies at midday, unchanged from
yesterday's close but 0.3 points above the 1100 GMT level.
    The market had feared that a deteriorating non-oil trade
pattern would undermine international support for sterling,
which has been the motor behind the recent fall in U.K.
Interest rates. Money market sources said the market had begun
to doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending rates
to 9.5 pct from the present 10.0 pct was really on the cards.
    But sentiment now looks to have turned about again.
    There now looks to be no danger that the Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson's forecast of a 1987 current account
deficit of 2.5 billion stg will be exceeded, said Wroblewski.
    Seasonally adjusted figures showed that imports rose in
February to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January.
    Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion from 6.20 billion.
    However, Chris Tinker, U.K. Analyst at brokers Phillips and
Drew said that the faster rise in exports than imports would
prove partly aberrational in coming months. He forecast the
Chancellor's Budget tax cuts would increase consumer expediture
on imported goods.
    However, Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, said
his firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficit
forecast in the light of the latest data, cutting one billion
stg off the expected full year total to about 1.75 billion stg.
    He said news of strong growth in exports of non-oil goods
confirmed recent bullish surveys among members of the
Confederation of British Industry.
    The growth in imports appears to be flattening, even if
January's bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseas
goods and import-intensive stock building among manufactureres,
Harwood said.
    U.K. Government bonds, or gilts, surged by more than 1/2
point on the better-than-expected news, as earlier worries
about the figures evaporated.
    Sterling peaked at a high of 1.6075 dlrs, before settling
to a steady 1.6050 dlrs about 1300 GMT, nearly a cent higher
than the European low of 1.5960.
    However, analysts noted that the turnabout in market
sentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news.
    Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was
largely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that the
Conservative government's support was slipping.
    The Marplan poll, published in "Today," showed Conservative
support had fallen to 36 pct, from 38 pct last month, while the
Alliance of Liberals and Social Democrats had rallied to 31
pct, from 21 pct, to run neck and neck with the Labour Party,
whose own support fell from 38 pct.
    The poll was taken after the Budget, which was greeted
enthusiastically by financial markets but seems to have left
the voters indifferent, political observers said.
    Another regular poll is due tomorrow, and eonomists warn
that today's improved sentiment could be dented if support for
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher slips again.
    This upsetting of the markets' political perceptions, which
are all but discounting a Conservative victory in the upcoming
general election, made them more sensitive to the trade data,
Harwood said. "The news did come as a very, very substantial
relief," he said.
    However, on the interest rate front, economists caution
that Lawson might be wary of leaving sterling vulnerable by
encouraging another base rate fall. They noted Lawson had
already got an inflation-reducing cut in mortgage rates in
response to lower base rates, so domestic political reasons for
lower rates have been curtailed.

crude oil to help reduce its huge trade surplus with the United

    They said the plan would dominate discussions at two-day

reduce a widening trade gap between the two countries."
    Huh said however that South Korean refineries considered
the Alaskan oil economically uncompetitive.

<TITLE>GERMAN ANALYSTS SEE GOLD FIRMING LATER THIS YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The price of gold bullion is likely
to rise in the second half of the year on increased private
investor demand, West German analysts said.
    Gold could rise as high as 500 dlrs per ounce later this
year, said Peter Witte, director of Westdeutsche Landesbank
Girozentrale's trading division, after a presentation by the
U.S. Mint to promote its gold and silver Eagle series coins.
    "A lot will depend on oil prices and developments on stock
exchanges," Witte said, adding he saw gold positioned for
further rises once it breaks out above 450 dlrs.
    Gold was fixed this morning in London at 411.30 dlrs.
    Despite current strong interest in gold mine stocks, many
investors still want to buy physical gold, Witte said.
    Interest in gold mine stocks may also wane if stock
exchange rallies under way in many countries start to waver.
    Hermann Strohmeyer, vice president of Commerzbank AG's
foreign exchange trading and treasury department, said gold is
poised to rise to 460 to 470 dlrs an ounce in the second half
of this year.
    The price is unlikely to fall much below 380 or 390 dlrs an
ounce, and probably will continue in a range between 380 and
430 dlrs in the first half of this year, he said.

<TITLE>CAROLIAN SYSTEMS SEES LOWER FISCAL 1987 PROFIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Carolian Systems International Inc>
said it anticipates profit for fiscal 1987 ending June 30 will
be lower than fiscal 1986 earnings of 410,000 dlrs, despite an
expected revenue increase of 37 pct to more than 3.5 mln dlrs.
    After an extraordinary expense associated with the
December, 1986 withdrawal of a planned common share offering,
"we expect to be modestly profitable for the year, but below the
410,000 dlrs earned in fiscal 1986," the company said.
    Carolian previously reported fiscal six month profit of
12,933 dlrs, excluding an extraordinary loss of 17,210 dlrs,
compared to earnings of 69,829 dlrs in the prior year.
    The company said it anticipated fiscal 1987 earnings to be
lower due to withdrawal of its share offering, computer
equipment shipment delays and costs associated with sales staff
expansion.
    A strengthening Canadian dollar against U.S. currency will
also adversely affect revenues and earnings, since 85 pct of
revenues are generated by sales outside Canada, said Carolian,
a leading supplier of utility software for Hewlett-Packard
computer systems.

<TITLE>U.S TREASURY'S MULFORD REAFFIRMS G-6 AGREEMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Assistant Secretary David
Mulford reaffirmed U.S. backing for the Paris Agreement among
six industrial nations to cooperate closely to foster exchange
rate stability around current levels.
    In testimony prepared for delivery before a Senate banking
subcommittee, Mulford said there was broad recognition in Paris
that "further substantial exchange rate shifts could damage
growth and adjustment prospects."
    But he also said while there are clear understandings among
the countries regarding cooperation, "We have refrained from
establishing a system of target zones or ranges."
    Mulford also said the six nations have not spelled out the
way in which they intend to deal with possible market
developments.
    He said governments must retain flexibility in dealing with
exchange market pressures and efforts to establish rigid
exchange rate objectives "or to specify too precisely the goals
of intervention" would hurt official attempts to react to
market pressures, he said.
    Accordingly, Mulford said setting specific currency
objectives and intervention to achieve those objectives would
be counterproductive.
    Commenting on the trade deficit, Mulford reiterated the
Treasury position that the current account deficit will decline
from 148 billion dlrs last year to around 130 billion dlrs this
year, due to the exchange rate adjustments of the past 18
months.
    But he added trade imbalances would also be corrected by
commitments from West Germany and Japan to stimulate their
economies and by U.S. efforts to cut the budget deficit and
enhance U.S. competitiveness.
    He also said some newly industrialized countries should let
their currencies appreciate.

<TITLE>U.S. GOLD EAGLE SALES PROJECTED AT 3.1 MLN OUNCES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>American Eagle gold bullion coin
sales are projected at 3.1 mln troy ounces in their first year
on the market, well above the target of 2.2 mln, Donna Pope,
director of the U.S. Mint, told journalists.
    World sales, which began on October 20, 1986, reached 2.193
mln ounces in less than six months of sales. This made it world
market leader with a share of 37 pct in 1986, Pope said.
    Pope said that in volume terms, nearly half of all gold
Eagle sales were within North America, roughly 40 pct were in
Europe and about eight pct in Asia.
    She said despite introduction of several new gold bullion
coins on the market recently, the Mint is aiming to preserve
the Eagle's strong market share with extensive publicity.
    The Mint uses mainly newly mined U.S. Gold for the coins,
as long as this is available at market prices. The remaining
gold is taken either from U.S. Treasury stocks, or from the
open market, Pope said.
    Gold analysts said the Eagle is facing competition here
from the Canadian Maple Leaf, and also to a lesser extent from
the South African Krugerrand. Some estimated the Maple Leaf's
West German market share at 60 pct.
    The figures may be distorted, as many German investors buy
gold bullion in Switzerland or Luxembourg to escape the 14 pct
value-added tax imposed here. Including the tax, the one-ounce
coins traded today at 906 marks, they said.
    Competition may also come from new gold coins, including
Belgium's ECU, which began sales today. Britain and Australia
also have plans to mint gold bullion coins, the analysts said.

<TITLE>FOOTHILL GROUP &lt;FGI> SEES BETTER FIRST QUARTER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Don Gevirtz, chairman of The Foothill
Group Inc, told Reuters the company's first quarter results
will be up sharply over last year's eight cents a share.
    "First quarter results will be dramatically better," he
said following a presentation to analysts. He cited a sharp
drop in non-earning assets, healthy asset growth and lower
expenses.
    He declined to predict specific results for the first
quarter. In the 1986 first quarter, the commerical finance
company earned 606,000 dlrs, or eight cts per share.
    Gevirtz also declined to predict full year results, but
said, "We expect an excellent year." In 1986 Foothill earned
3,239,000 dlrs, or 41 cts per share.
    Analysts expect Foothill to record earnings of 65 cts to 85
cts a share in 1987.
    During the presentation Gevirtz said Foothill has reduced
to less than five pct the company's level of non-performing
assets, which was as high as eight pct in previous years.
    David Hilton, chief financial officer, said the company's
general and administrative expenses in 1987 will be reduced to
about 3.0 to 3.5 pct of average assets from 4.3 pct in 1986.
    The company had average assets of 399.8 mln dlrs from
continuing operations and 29.8 mln dlrs from discontinued
operations in 1986, according to its annual report.

<TITLE>BANK OF FRANCE BUYS DOLLARS, SELLS YEN - DEALERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of France intervened on the
market to buy dollars and sell yen to support the U.S.
Currency, dealers said.
    A major French bank said it acted for the central bank in
buying between five and 15 mln dlrs against yen.
    A dealer at another bank said his bank had been asked to
publicise the intervention, to send a clear signal to the
markets that central banks were acting in concert to maintain
the exchange rates agreed to be appropriate at last month's
meeting of the Group of Five and Canada in Paris.
    The dollar was being quoted at 6.0950/70 francs in early
afternoon dealings after a fix of 6.09425 francs.
    The major French bank said it sold yen at a rate of 149.28
against the dollar.
    The U.S. Currency was subsequently being quoted at
149.25/35.
    The Bank of Japan was reported in the market overnight to
bolster the credibility of the Paris accord following several
days of pressure against the dollar.
    Pressure developed after U.S. Treasury Secretary James
Baker repeated earlier statements that the Reagan
administration had no targets for the dollar, apparently
undermining the assumption that the agreement in Paris had
fixed broad fluctuation ranges for major currencies.
    Baker later said his remark had been misinterpreted.

<TITLE>MULFORD SEES MORE BANK LOANS TO DEBTORS IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Treasury Assistant Secretary
David Mulford said he foresaw substantial net new commercial
loans to the major debtor countries in 1987.
    In testimony before a Senate banking subcommittee, Mulford
said he based this prediction on progress in talks between
banks and Mexico, Chile, and Venezuela, as well as progress in
negotiations with the Philippines.
    "These agreements, together with others for Argentina and
we hope Brazil," should assure substantial new loans this year,
Mulford said.
    Mulford defended the U.S. strategy for handling the debt
crisis and added additional steps, like development by
commercial banks of a menu of options to support debtor reform,
can be undertaken.
    That particular development would maintain broad bank
participation in new financing packages to debtors.
    Mulford stessed that greater flexibility in devising new
money packages may be essential for future bank syndications.
    "The commercial banks have much to gain from taking the
lead themselves to develop the kinds of ideas that help assure
the concerted lending process works," he said.
    In particular, Mulford said banks and debtor nations will
increasingly move toward repricing, retiming or rescheduling
agreements as an alternative to new loans.
    "The benefits of such approaches may be substantial and
may, in the right circumstances, be easier to achieve than new
money packages," he said.
    But for debtors with substantial financing needs, new
lending will still be necessary, he said.
    Mulford rejected congressional ideas for a debt facility as
being far too costly to creditor governments, and ultimately
taxpayers.
    Mulford urged further development of debt-equity swaps as
well as broader mutual funds for conversion into equity.
    As in the past, Mulford said progress must be founded on
economic reforms and sufficient new financing for debtors both
to support those reforms and generate new growth.

<TITLE>ANCHOR GLASS &lt;AGLS> NOW SEES HIGHER 1ST QTR NET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TAMPA, Fla., March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Anchor Glass Container Corp said
first quarter net income is now expected to exceed the 3.1 mln
dlrs earned before extraordinary items in the year earlier
quarter.
    Previously, the company had said first quarter results
would likely be lower than for the 1986 period due to
production disruptions caused by the large number of production
line changes scheduled during the first quarter, its statement
pointed out.
    While the disruptive effects of the production line changes
had occurred in line with expectations, Anchor Glass said,
first quarter operating results were helped by lower than
anticipated operating costs and improved margins on sales as a
result of a more favorable product mix.
    The company said its income performance for the full year
remains very good.
    It also said Anchor Hocking Corp &lt;ARH> has converted the
entire principal balance of its Anchor Glass convertible
subordinated note to 576,694 Anchor Glass common shares.
    Anchor Glass said the conversion decreased its total debt
and increased stockholders' equity by about 9.4 mln dlrs and
increased common shares outstanding to 13,902,716.
    It said the conversion will also reduce its annualized net
interest expense by about 1.1 mln dlrs, or 600,000 dlrs after
taxes.

<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Stone Container Corp said it has

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The financially-troubled Farm Credit
System today formally asked that the Treasury Department
provide a line of credit to the system and that Congress take
steps to guarantee stock held by borrowers.
    In testimony prepared for delivery to a Senate agriculture
subcommittee hearing, Brent Beesley, president of the Farm
Credit Corp, said "In order to avoid the need for continued
appropriations, the Farm Credit System Capital Corp should have
a line of credit from the Treasury."
    Beesley said in April the system would recommend a dollar
amount of aid needed.
    In addition, Beesley urged Congress to immediately take
steps to reassure borrowers from the system that their stock is
secure.
    We urged the Congress to go on record through a resolution
stating its commitment to protect the stock," Beesley said.
    Borrowers from the system own some four billion dlrs in
stock that could be jeopardized by the mounting losses of the
Farm Credit System.
    Beesley also said that if Congress takes action to reduce
interest rates offered to farmers to below-market levels, "The
government should provide this interest rate relief.

<TITLE>ALUMINIUM SCRAP RECOVERY AND USAGE TO RISE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Aluminium scrap recovery and usage and
output of secondary metal will continue to rise, said Shearson
Lehman Brothers in a review of the secondary aluminium market
which details cost and demand factors.
    Although primary smelting costs have declined generally in
recent years, the still substantial energy cost savings offered
by secondary smelters will continue to make re-melted material
increasingly attractive.
    It takes around 15,000 kilowatt hours (kwh) of electricity
to produce one tonne of primary aluminium compared with around
550 kwh for one tonne of secondary metal, Shearson said.
    On the demand side, developments in automobiles and
packaging bode well for secondary aluminium consumption.
    Automobile production, although expected to fall this year,
is still on an upward trend and will continue to be so for the
foreseeable future and, in addition, use of aluminium castings
is gaining wider acceptance in the automobile industry,
particularly in the U.S.
    In packaging, Shearson does not expect aluminium to
dominate the beverage can market in any of the other major
economies to the extent it does in the U.S., But says there is
evidence recycling is on the increase in other countries.
    In addition to the cost savings involved, technology
advances now enable alloys of higher purity to be produced by
the secondary aluminium industry, Shearson said.
    There is not likely to be a problem of availability as the
U.S. Has a huge scrap reservoir and this is also true of
several European countries, albeit on a smaller scale.

ending June this year, down from the 2.25 pct forecast
contained in the 1986/87 budget delivered last August.
    Australia's terms of trade also fell, by 18 pct, over the
past two years, he told Parliament. Terms of trade are the
difference between import and export price indexes.
    Despite the figures, the budget forecast of about 1.75 pct
annual growth in employment would be met, Keating said.
    Unemployment is currently at 8.2 pct of the workforce.
    "This government is dragging Australia through a trading
holocaust the kind of which we have not seen since the Second
World War," Keating said.
    "We are not pushing this place into a recession. We are not
only holding our gains on unemployment, we are bringing
unemployment down," he said, adding that the government had help
the country avoid recession.

estimated 13 pct higher this year at 2,720 tonnes, up from
2,400 in 1986, Agriculture Ministry officials said.
    This improvement reflects the government's efforts over the
last seven years to extend existing cocoa plantations and plant
new higher yielding varieties, particularly at the northern tip
of the island, they said.
    Last year, Madagascar exported 2,189 tonnes of high quality
cocoa, up from 1,624 in 1985, the Trade Ministry said.
    This year's exports are estimated at 2,400 tonnes.

<TITLE>SWISS NET CAPITAL EXPORTS RISE IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Increased activity by Switzerland's
banks pushed net capital exports to a provisional 11.7 billion
francs last year from 10.0 billion in 1985, the National Bank
said in a pre-publication copy of its annual report.
    It also said the current account surplus of the Swiss
balance of payments reached a provisional 13.5 billion francs
last year, from 12.8 billion in 1985.
    The National Bank's currency reserves rose by 1.8 billion
francs, against a 2.8 billion rise in 1985. However, taking
into accounts effects of the shift in exchange rates, reserves
actually fell in value by 1.9 billion.
    The banks' net capital exports climbed to 5.4 billion
francs, from 5.1 billion in 1985, while capital exports by
domestic non-banks fell to 5.0 billion from 9.1 billion.
    The National Bank gave the following figures (1985 in
brackets)
    Current Account +13.5 billion (+12.8 in 1985), made up of:
    Goods                     -7.1 (-8.7)
    Services                  +10.1 (+9.8)

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>DUTCH GRAIN LEVY TEST CASE TO START IN APRIL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROTTERDAM, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>A large Dutch animal feed compounder
will begin formal legal proceedings early next month as a test
case on the way the EC grain co-responsibility levy is applied,
a spokesman for Dutch grain and feed trade association, Het
Comite, told Reuters.
    Het Comite has been co-ordinating national actions against
alleged distortions caused by currency factors in the levy and,
since December, has lodged more than 80 individual cases with
the Business Appeal Court in The Hague.
    The basic complaint is that the levy does not take account
of currency cross-rates of exchange and therefore compounders
in countries with strong currencies may have to pay more in
their own currency than is paid to them by producers in another
country.
    Het Comite has obtained a temporary agreement that
companies can pay the amount they receive toward the levy
rather than paying a full guilder amount to the Dutch grain
commodity board.
    The spokesman said Het Comite will provide financial and
legal backing to the test case in the Business Administration
Court in the Hague. Oral proceedings are to begin on April 10.
    The spokesman said Het Comite finally selected the company
for the test case from among the 80 lodged "because the bill
(the firm) received from the commodity board for payment of the
levy contained significant currency distortions and involved
grain from a wide variety of origins." The name of the company
is not being made public.
    The Administration Court is not expected to make a final
ruling on the case in the near future. The Het Comite spokesman
said it was very likely it would refer questions to the Appeal
Court in Luxembourg, and "as a result it could easily be another
nine to 12 months before the matter is finally resolved."
    Meanwhile, the actions by Dutch animal feed compounders are
putting pressure on the commodity board to urge the Dutch
government to follow through on earlier statements and seek a
complete review in Brussels of the way in which the levy is
collected, the spokesman said.
    Het Comite, as a member of FEFAC, the association of
European animal feed manufacturers, is also a party to actions
protesting the whole levy in the Luxembourg appeal court.

<TITLE>MULFORD SAYS G-6 WANTS STABILITY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Assistant Secretary David
Mulford said the Paris agreement among leading industrial
nations is intended to produce "reasonable stability" in exchange
markets over the next few months.
    He told a Senate Banking subcommittee the Group of Five
nations and Canada agreed in Paris to "see if there can't be a
period of reasonable stability instead of volatility" to give
time for the committments in Paris to take place.
    Asked by Sen Phil Gramm (R-Tex) whether U.S. intervention
was not in fact overvaluing the dollar, Mulford replied that
the administration judged that after economic adjustments,
current exchange rates reflect underlying economic
fundamentals.
    In particular, the stability sought by the nations would
allow West Germany and Japan to stimulate their economies
domestically and the U.S. to cut its budget deficit, Mulford
said in his testimony.
    He stressed that a further sharp fall in the dollar would
hurt the ability of Germany and Japan to boost growth.
    Mulford noted that half of West Germany's economy was
affected by international developments.
    He also said increased Japanese domestic growth would
result in more U.S. exports to Japan and would not necessarily
lead to greater Japanese capital flows to the U.S., as Gramm
asserted, if Japan reformed its domestic capital market.
    Commenting on the Paris agreement, Mulford said, "I think
exchange rates ought to be stabilized so (Germany's and
Japan's) efforts can be carried out.
    Mulford rejected Gramm's argument that faster domestic
growth in Germany and Japan would result in an even lower
dollar.
    Mulford said the administration wanted to achieve a pattern
of higher growth overseas as a way of improving the U.S. trade
deficit.
    Otherwise, he said, the trade deficit would be resolved
either through a much lower dollar or a U.S. recession, both
alternatives he termed unacceptable and undesirable.

<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Fruehauf Corp, which went private in
December through a leveraged buyout, said the predecessor
company had a 1986 loss of 60.9 mln dlrs compared to earnings
of 70.5 mln dlrs in 1985.
    Sales of the predecessor company were 2.68 billion dlrs
compared to 2.56 billion dlrs in 1985, including the sales by
the operations which are divestiture candidates.
    Fruehauf said in connection with the buyout acquisition,
the predecessor company incurred about 97 mln dlrs in expenses
charged against 1986 operations.
    In addition to the direct expenses, Fruehauf said operating
results were adversely affected by an unquantifiable amount due
to the disruption related to a proxy contest and attempted
hostile takeover which started in early 1986.
    Fruehauf said its board rescheduled the annual meeting to
June 18 from May 7 to allow for completion and distribution of
the 1986 results to shareholders.

<TITLE>MICHIGAN GENERAL &lt;MGL> TO SELL KRESTMARK UNIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SADDLE BROOK, N.J., March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Michigan General Corp said
it agreed to sell substantially all of the assets and certain
liabilities of its Krestmark subsidiaries to LCB Holdings Inc
for 6.5 mln dlrs cash.
    Sale of Texas-based Krestmark, a maker of doors, door
frames and other products, will allow Michigan General to
concentrate on retailing through its Diamond Lumber and
Savannah Wholesale units.
    Proceeds of the sale will be used to reduce debt. The deal
is subject to execution of a definitive agreement.
    Krestmark had revenues of about 40 mln dlrs and operating
losses of three mln dlrs in 1986, the company said. It has been
accounted for as a discontinued operation since last September.
    Dallas-based LCB is a privately-held maker of structural
steel joists and rack and storage handling systems.
    Michigan General also said its Diamond Lumber homebuilding
products retail unit closed nine unprofitable stores in the
first quarter and reduced its headquarters staff by 10 pct. The
nine closed stores, which had pretax operating losses of 1.7
mln dlrs in 1986, are being sold to provide cash for
operations.
    About 4.5 mln dlrs of inventory from the stores is being
transferred to other locations, the company said.

an offering of sinking fund debentures due 2017 yielding 8.84
pct, said lead manager Salomon Brothers Inc.
    The debentures have an 8-3/4 pct coupon and were priced at
99.055 to yield 115 basis points over the off-the-run 9-1/4 pct
Treasury bonds of 2016. First Boston co-managed the deal.
    The issue is non-refundable for 10 years. A sinking fund
starting in 1998 to retire annually five pct of the debentures
can be upped by 200 pct at the company's option, giving them an
estimated minimum life of 13.85 years and maximum of 20.5
years. The debt is rated Aa-3 by Moody's and A-plus by S/P.

<TITLE>U.S. SENATE HITS EC OILS TAX, VOWS RETALIATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Senate voted to condemn the
proposed European common market tax on vegetable and marine
fats and oils and said it would result in retaliation.
    The non-binding Senate resolution, a sense of Senate
sentiment, was approved on a 99 to 0 vote.
    "The administration should communicate to the European
Community the message that the United States will view the
establishment of such a tax as inconsistent with the European
Community's obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade that will result in the adoption of strong and
immediate countermeasures," the resolution stated.
    The resolution said the European Community Commission has
proposed establishing a consumption tax on vegetable and fish
oils and fats in conjunction with the setting of farm prices
for the 1987/1988 EC marketing year.
    The Senate said the tax would amount to almost 90 pct of
the current price of soyoil and "have a restrictive effect" on
U.S. exports of soybeans and vegetable oils to the EC.
    It would be "blatantly inconsistent" with obligations of the
EC under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, the
resolution said, and "constitute another egregious attempt" to
impose EC agricultural costs on trading partners.

<TITLE>BANK OF BOSTON &lt;BKB> SEES IMPROVED 1ST QUARTER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOSTON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bank of Boston Corp expects first
quarter earnings will range between 90 cts and one dlr a share,
up from 79 cts a share last year, Chairman William Brown said.
    He told shareholders the company has a 190 mln dlr exposure
in loans to Brazil if that country defaults on its debt
payments. If a default does occur, it would first quarter
earnings by about five cts a share, which would bring the
bank's in the lower level of the estimated range, he added.
    Brown noted the 1986 first quarter net included a 17 cts
gain from loan restructurings which will not appear this year.
    Brown said the bank's other nonperforming assets, not
including its Brazilian exposure, could rise to over 700 mln
dlrs at the end of this quarter compared with 669 mln dlrs a
year earlier and 614 mln dlrs at the end of 1986.
    He said the increase includes all of its Equadorian loans
which he expects will be ultimately repaid after the company
recovers from an earthquake earlier this year.
    Brown said the increase also includes some Mexican and
Venezuelan loans as those nations are also facing credit
problems.
    Brown said the Bank of Boston remains "cautiously optimitic
about the full year even if our Brazilian exposure were to be
on nonaccural all year." In 1986, the bank earned 3.69 dlrs a
share, or 232.8 mln dlrs on net interest revenues of 1.08
billion dlrs.
    President Ira Stepanian told the shareholders's meeting the
bank's total loans to Argentina, Brazil and Mexico totaled 875
mln dlrs at the end of 1986, 37 pct of its primary capital.
Brazil loans total 300 mln dlrs, of which about two-thirds are
affected by its suspension of interest payments on its medium
and long term foreign debt.

enter the U.S. government securities market to add reserves
during its usual intervention period today, economists said.
    With federal funds trading at a steady 6-3/16 pct, most
economists expect an indirect injection of temporary reserves
via a medium-sized round of customer repurchase agreements.
    However, some economists said the Fed may arrange more
aggressive system repurchase agreements.
    Economists would also not rule out an outright bill pass
early this afternoon. Such action had been widely anticipated
yesterday but failed to materialize.

<TITLE>DOLLAR/YEN INTERVENTION RESPONDS TO PRESSURE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Brian Childs, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of France intervened to buy
small amounts of dollars and sell yen in Paris today to
stabilise the exchange rates agreed at last month's meeting of
Finance Ministers of the Group of Five and Canada, foreign
exchange dealers said.
    But they said recent central bank intervention in the
foreign exchange markets appeared to be a limited reaction to
temporary pressures rather than a major defence operation.
    A Bank of France spokesman declined all comment but sources
close to the central bank said it had also intervened
yesterday.
    Dealers said the earlier intervention was in concert with
the Bundesbank and Bank of Japan.
    The sources said the French central bank could have been in
the market again today in two-way operations, not necessarily
on its own account, but to counter short-term pressures arising
from the end of the Japanese financial year on March 31.
    One major French bank said it bought between five and 15
mln dlrs for the central bank and sold yen at 149.28 to the
dollar.
    Another bank said it had been asked by the Bank of France
to say it was in the market, a departure from the central
bank's usual insistence on confidentiality.
    But other banks said they had seen no sign of intervention,
which they said appeared to be on a very limited scale.
    "Even if 10 banks were buying five to 15 mln dlrs, you would
still be talking of a small overall amount," said one dealer.
    Recent intervention by the Bank of Japan appeared mainly to
have been required to meet year-end window dressing demand for
yen. "This is a specific short term phenomenon rather than a
wider trend," the dealer said.
    Operators have been extremely cautious about testing the
dollar's trading ranges against the West German mark and
Japanese yen.
    These ranges were set in February's stabilisation agreement
reached here by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker and the
Finance Ministers of Japan, Germany, France, Britain and
Canada.
    But speculative pressures started to build again this week
after Baker was quoted on British television at the weekend as
repeating earlier statements that Washington had no target for
the dollar.
    Baker yesterday moved to defuse speculation he was talking
the dollar down, telling a Cable News Network interviewer and a
Senate committee he stood by the Paris agreement. Foreign
exchange markets had been misreading his comments, he said.

<TITLE>WALL STREET STOCKS/U.S. OIL COMPANIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>British Petroleum Co PLC's
announcement that its U.S. subsidiary intends to tender for the
45 pct of Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD> it does not already own,
catapulted U.S. oil stocks sharply higher this morning, traders
and analysts said.
    "It raises the specter of additional consolidation in the
industry and that is what is boosting the other oils," analyst
Rosario Ilacqua of L.F. Rothschild said.
    Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers said "this
deal shows that British Petroleum, a conservative investor that
knows the oil business, is clearly confident in the U.S. oil
industry, and that shines well on the U.S. companies."
    Philips Petroleum &lt;P> gained 3/4 to 15-7/8, Occidental
Petroleum &lt;OXY> one to 34-5/8, USX Corp &lt;X>, with its Marathon
Oil Co unit, rose 1/2 to 28-3/8. Exxon &lt;XON> climbed one to
88-3/8, Mobil &lt;MOB> one to 50-1/4, Atlantic Richfield &lt;ARC>
3-1/8 to 80-1/2, Amoco &lt;AN> 1-7/8 to 84-1/8, and Amerada Hess
one to 33-5/8. BP gained 2-3/8 to 59-3/4.
    Both analysts said the rise in Standard's price this
morning to above the proposed tender price of 70 dlrs a share,
is an indication that investors expect the bid to be sweetened.
Standard gained 6-3/4 to 71-5/8.
    The analysts cited Royal Dutch/Shell Group's &lt;RD> &lt;SC> bid
for Shell Oil Co, which was sweetened before its successful
conclusion.
    Margoshes said the BP action "is an articulation of the
underlying value of oil companies in the marketplace." But he
expressed skepticism that this will necessarily lead to
heightened merger or buyout activity in the oil group.

<TITLE>NORCEN SEES IMPROVEMENT IN 1987 EARNINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CALGARY, Alberta, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Norcen Energy Resources Ltd>,
41 pct owned by &lt;Hees International Corp>, said earnings and
cash flow will improve in 1987, even if oil and gas prices
remain at 1986 levels.
    The improvement will result from production increases,
lower taxes and royalties, reduced financing costs and from
operating efficiencies and downsizing put into place during
1986, the company said in the annual report.
    Norcen previously reported 1986 earnings, excluding a 20.1
mln dlr writeoff, declined by 58 pct to 50.0 mln dlrs from
119.7 mln dlrs in in 1985.
    Norcen's 1986 cash flow fell 10 pct to 204.9 mln dlrs from
228.9 mln dlrs in the prior year.
    It said the sharp decline in oil prices during 1986 was the
most significant factor for Norcen's reduced performance.
    "While financial results are far from the previous year's
record levels, it is clear that Norcen has withstood declining
prices and remains financially and operationally strong," Norcen
said. It did not give a specific 1987 profit forecast.
    The company said it is well positioned to capitalize on
profitable opportunities in its core business areas, and will
continue to invest to increase revenue and asset values.

<TITLE>COCOA COUNCIL HEAD TO PRESENT BUFFER COMPROMISE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>International Cocoa Organization, ICCO,
council chairman Denis Bra Kanon will present a compromise
proposal on buffer stock rules to producer and consumer
delegates either later today or tomorrow morning, delegates
said.
    Bra Kanon held private bilateral consultations with major
producers and consumers this morning to resolve outstanding
differences, mostly on the issues of how much non-member cocoa
the buffer stock can purchase and price differentials for
different varieties.
    Delegates were fairly confident the differences could be
worked out in time to reach agreement tomorrow.
    Some consuming member nations, including Britain and
Belgium, favour the buffer stock buying more than 10 pct
non-member cocoa, delegates have said.
    The consumers argue that buying cheaper, lower quality
non-member cocoas, particularly Malaysian, will most
effectively support prices because that low quality cocoa is
currently pressuring the market.
    Producers, meanwhile, say non-member cocoa should make up
at most a very small percentage of the buffer. They say
Malaysia should not be able to benefit from the ICCO unless it
is a member, and if the buffer stock bought Malaysian cocoa
Malaysia would have no incentive to join, delegates said.
    As to differentials, Ghana apparently wanted a higher
differential for its cocoa than is outlined in the most recent
proposal, so it would have a better chance of having its cocoa
bought for the buffer stock, producer delegates said.
    Some consumers wanted differentials to be adjusted in a way
that would not promote buffer stock purchases of the more
expensive cocoas, such as Ghanaian and Brazilian, they said.
    Other technical points need to be sorted out, including
limits on how much cocoa the buffer stock manager can buy in
nearby, intermediate and forward positions and the consequent
effect on prices in the various deliveries, delegates said.

<TITLE>SIEMENS REBUTTS U.S. CRITICISM ON CGCT OFFER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MUNICH, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Siemens AG &lt;SIEG.F> rebutted U.S.
Criticism it is blocking American Telephone and Telegraph
Corp's &lt;T.N>, AT and T, entry into French telecommunications
firm &lt;Compagnie Generale Constructions Telephoniques>, CGCT.
    Management board member Hans Baur told journalists that the
acquisition of a joint 20 pct stake in CGCT by AT and T and
Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken NV &lt;PGLO.AS> had not been decided
on two years ago as claimed by AT and T.
    The French government, which owns CGCT, had asked Siemens
at the start of 1986 to submit an offer for the stake in CGCT.
The result of the negotiations was still open.
    Baur said Siemens had first made an offer last summer.
    The Handelsblatt newspaper today quoted AT and T chairman
James E. Olson as saying that Siemens' attempt to stop AT and T
and Philips could lead to a resurgence of protectionism in the
U.S.
    Baur said he expected the French government to decide on
the winning bid by the end of April. CGCT's share of the French
switchboard market amounts to around 16 pct.
    The French government has limited CGCT participation by
foreign companies to 20 pct and set a price of 500 mln francs
for the whole company.
    Bauer said the 20 pct limitation would only apply to the
initial stake. He did not rule out a stake increase later but
said Siemens' aim was to introduce its technology.
    Bauer said Siemens and French telecommunications firm
&lt;Jeumont-Schneider SA> submitted a joint offer at the start of
March because of the 20 pct limitation. Both companies will
form a joint venture to take over the whole of CGCT.
   Siemens will have a 20 pct stake in the new company while
Jeumont-Schneider will own 80 pct. Apart from investing 100 mln
francs for the modernisation of CGCT, a new research centre
with was also being planned.

<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ford Motor Co neared General Motors
Corp last year in executive bonuses, while it topped the larger
automaker in profit sharing payments to workers.
    Ford, which outstripped GM in earnings last year, said its
1986 incentive bonuses totaled 167 mln dlrs, slightly behind
General Motors' 169.1 mln.
    General Motors, however, did not make any profit-sharing
payments to its workers, while Ford made a profit-sharing
distribution of 372 mln dlrs, or 2,100 dlrs per worker.
    General Motors, which saw its earnings drop to 2.94 billion
dlrs from 1985's 3.99 billion, said the 1986 profit was "not
sufficient to generate a payout under the profit-sharing
formula."
    Ford, which earned 3.28 billion dlrs in 1986, up from 2.51
billion in 1985, said it "recognizes employees' efforts and
fulfills its commitment to them in many ways, including
profit-sharing."

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Assistant Secretary David
Mulford said he did not believe that West Germany and Japan
have yet carried out their international responsibilities.
    "I do not believe they have up to this time," Mulford told
a Senate banking subcommittee.
    He said that for the U.S. trade deficit to continue
improving in the next two years, "We need more policy actions"
across the entire front of U.S. trade relations, including
Canada and the newly-industrialized countries (NICS).
    In particular, he said, efforts by South Korea and Taiwan
to strengthen their currencies were still disappointing.
    Mulford also said that OECD nations need to grow an average
three pct to help resolve the international debt crisis.
    He noted that Japanese and European imports from Latin
nations were significantly smaller than imports into the U.S.
    He stressed both Germany and Japan must continue to take
economic and structural measures to ensure stronger sustained
economic growth.

<TITLE>PIER 1 IMPORTS &lt;PIR> DECLARES STOCK SPLIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FORT WORTH, Tex., March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pier 1 Imports Inc said its
board declared a three-for-two split of its common stock and
its 25 cents preferred stock, and declared a regular quarterly
dividend of two cents per share on the pre-split shares of
common stock outstanding.
    Pier 1 also declared a 12.5 pct annual dividend increase
for the post-split common shares. The split will be effected in
the form of a 50 pct stock dividend on both classes.
    The company said shareholder approval is required for an
increase in authorized shares of common stock to 100 mln from
25 mln.
    It said approval is also needed for an increase in
authorized shares of preferred stock from one million to five
million. It said voting will be conducted at its annual
shareholder meeting on June 24.
    Pier 1 said there are currently 19.1 million shares of
common stock and 960,000 shares of 25 cts preferred stock
outstanding.
    The split shares will be distributed on June 29 to
shareholders of record May 13. The two cts per share quarterly
cash dividend will be payable May 29 to shareholders of record
May 13.
    "The increase in shares outstanding will broaden the base
of stock ownership in the company, and the dividend increase
reflects the directors' positive outlook for the future
prospects of Pier 1 Imports," said Clark Johnson, president and
chief executive officer.

<DATELINE>    NORTHBROOK, ILL., March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>HealthMate Inc said its
auditors, Laventhol and Horwath, indicated they will issue a
qualified opinion on the company's financial statements.
    The company, which went public in March 1985, earlier
reported losses for the fourth quarter.
    It said the auditor's statement, known as a "subject to"
opinion, cautions that, because of continuing operating losses
and negative cash flow, it must achieve profitable operations
or acquire additional equity capital or other financing to
continue in existence.
    HealthMate reported a loss for the year of 1,512,534 dlrs,

<TITLE>BRAZIL ASKS 60-DAY EXTENSION SHORT-TERM CREDIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRASILIA, MARCH 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil today suggested to its foreign
bank creditors an extension of short-term credit lines for 60
days until May 31, a spokesman for the Central Bank said.
    He said that with the move, called a "standstill"
arrangement, Brazil was only trying to avoid difficulties to
pay its 109 billion dlrs debt in the future.
    The spokesman told Reuters that Brazil's suggestion will be
communicated by telex to Brazil's 700 bank creditors.
    The spokesman declined to give details of what was included
in the statement, but said Central Bank president Francisco
Gros was seeking a 60-day extension of the short-term credit
lines from its commercial bank creditors.
    The amount of these credit lines totals 15 billion dollars,
and deadline for payment is set for March 31.
    Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said in a television
interview it was "absolutely important" for Brazil and its
creditors to renew the short-term credit lines, as Brazil must
finance its exports.
    "If these credit lines were cut, we would face difficulties
to honour our foreign debt in the future," Funaro said.
    "There is evidently a common interest in the matter," he said.
    Funaro said, however, he was told creditors understand
Brazil's position and do not wish to turn the negotiation for
the renewal of the credit lines more difficult.
    Brazil last month suspended interest payments on its 68-
billion dlrs debt to commercial banks and froze short-term
trade and money market lines.
    He said Brazil's suggestion is part of its demands "before
the need to renew the mechanisms of loans in the world."
    Funaro said currently debt negotiations are "very complex
and complicated," mentioning cases of countries which had to
wait some 10 months before getting a reply from creditors.
    "We are not interested in confrontation, but we would like
the loan mechanisms to show that the crisis belongs to both
sides," Funaro said.
    Funaro denied rumours that he had offered his resignation
to President Jose Sarney.
    "Who decides whether to keep or dismiss his ministers is the
president. Everything else is nothing but speculation," he said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>USAir Group Inc said the U.S.
Department of Transportation has issued an order allowing it to
purchase and hold in a voting trust the 9,309,394 Piedmont
Aviation Inc shares USAir is seeking in its current 69 dlr per
share tender offer.
    The company said the new order supersedes an order issued
by the department last Friday that would have required USAir to
sell within one week of expiration of the tender any Piedmont
shares it held in excess of 51 pct of the Piedmont stock then
outstanding.
    The company said the 9,309,394 Piedmont shares, together
with the 2,292,599 Piedmont shares already owned by USAir,
constitute about 50.1 pct of Piedmont's shares on a
fully-diluted basius but about 61.0 pct of shares currently
outstanding.
    The shares are to be held in a voting trust pending the
department's review of USAir's application to obtain control of
Piedmont.

<DATELINE>    BONN, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German retailers expect another good
year in 1987 even though they will not be able to repeat the
sharp increase in turnover they enjoyed in 1986, the General
Association of the German Retail Trade (HDE) said.
    HDE President Wolfgang Hinrichs said retailers would be
satisfied with a real turnover increase of between 2.5 pct to
three pct in 1987 after last year's steep 3.7 pct rise.
    Hinrichs said the 1986 turnover increase had brought the
first hesitant signs of improvement in earnings in the West
German retail sector.

<TITLE>GERMAN WAGE ROUND SAID TO LIMIT MONETARY OPTIONS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Allan Saunderson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bundesbank's options for West
Germany monetary policy are limited for the foreseeable future
by the delicate stage of wage negotiations between unions and
employers, economists and money market dealers said.
    Call money fell in quite active trading today, dropping to
3.40/50 pct from 3.55/65 pct yesterday, and below the 3.50 pct
treasury bill rate as a difficult month-end approached.
    But dealers and economists said the Bundesbank was unlikely
to encourage lower rates in the foreseeable future largely for
fear of upsetting the current wage round.
    One money market dealer for a major foreign bank said, "I
don't think the Bundesbank wants rates to go up whatever
happens. But it also does not want them to fall. Above all it
wants to wait to see how the unions wage round goes."
    In West Germany, unions and employers prepare the ground
for triennial wage negotiations based on detailed assessments
of growth and inflation, economists said.
    Ute Geipel, economist with Citibank AG, said if the
Bundesbank became more accommodating in monetary policy,
raising fears in some quarters of a return in inflation in the
medium term, unions would be obliged to curtail wage demands.
    As a result the Bundesbank was concerned to make no move
that would interfere in the negotiating process, Geipel said.
    In the current round, the country's most powerful union,
the IG Metall representing metalworkers and engineers, is
demanding a shortening of the working week to 35 hours from the
present 38-1/2 and an accompanying five pct increase in wages.
    The engineering employers' association, Gesamtmetall, is
offering to bring in a 38-hour-week from July 1, 1988, and give
a two stage wage increase -- a 2.7 pct rise from April 1 this
year and another 1.5 pct from July 1, 1988.
    The agreement forged by IG Metall -- Europe's largest
union, with 2.5 mln members -- and the employers would set the
benchmark for settlements in other industries such as the
public sector, banks and federal post office. Negotiations
began in December and unions are hopeful they may conclude by
early April, ahead of the traditional holiday period in June.
    Though many economists said the unions' current warning
strikes and rhetoric were part of the negotiating strategy and
would not lead to a repeat of 1984's damaging seven-week
strikes, others said unions would not compromise greatly on
their positions and there could still be conflict.
    This could extend the length of time in which the
Bundesbank would keep its activity low-key, economists said.
    The money market head said the unions' humiliation by the
protracted financial problems of the Neue Heimat cooperative
housing venture would contribute to union obstinacy.
    "The unions haven't forgotten that and they will put this
squarely onto the account in the negotiations," he said.
    In addition, the newly-elected chairman of the IG Metall
union, Franz Steinkuehler, was more radical and determined than
his predecessor Hans Meyer and may be set for a longer battle
to achieve the best possible settlement for his membership.
    More than 16,000 engineering workers at 45 firms, mainly in
south Germany, held warning strikes lasting up to two hours
yesterday. Firms hit included Zahnradfabrik Passau GmbH and
aerospace group Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GmbH.
    Today, 28,000 employees from 110 companies came out in
warning strikes, a statement from IG Metall said.
    Money market dealers said that overnight call money rates
would rise in the near future in any case and did not depend on
a politically-inhibited Bundesbank.
    About eight billion marks were coming into the market
tomorrow from salary payments by the federal government.
    As a result, some banks fell back on the Bundesbank's offer
to mop up liquidity via the sale of three-day treasury bills,
anticipating still lower rates before the month-end.
    But a pension payment date by banks on behalf of customers
was due on Monday, other dealers noted. If banks were short of
liquidity until the bills matured on Tuesday, rates could soar,
perhaps to the 5.50 pct Lombard ceiling.
    Banks were well stocked up with funds, having an average
52.1 billion marks in Bundesbank minimum reserves in the first
24 days of March, well above the 50.7 billion requirement.

<TITLE>FIRST INTERSTATE SEEKS ACQUISITION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    by Janie Gabbett</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Less than two months after First
Interstate Bancorp withdrew its bold attempt to buy BankAmerica
Corp, Chairman Joseph Pinola is still looking for a good buy,
but he is also looking at ways to avoid being bought.
    In a wide-ranging interview, Pinola said he's looking for
ways to improve profitability and capital between now and 1991,
"so as to resist any potential look at us...to maintain our
independence, if possible."
    In 1991 federal regulatory changes will allow the major
East Coast banks to buy banks in California.
    First Interstate, the fourth largest California bank, and
the nineth largest nationwide, owns 24 banks in 12 western
states and has franchise operations in four additional states.
    Bank industry sources say it is an attractive target for
large U.S. or foreign banks, looking to quickly move into the 
lucrative California market and the West Coast region.
    While declining specifics on his corporate strategy, when
asked if acquisitions will be part of the plan, Pinola replied,
"That's undoubtedly a fair statement...it would be almost naive
not to think that."
    Pinola characterized his acquisition strategy as
"opportunistic".
    He said he will look for banks in management trouble that
he can get at a bargain, then add management to restore
profitability, or for banks in states where First Interstate
already operates, then cut costs by combining resources.
    The exception, he said, would be Texas, where he said most
of the banks are already well managed, but might be purchased
at a discount because of the depressed regional economy.
    Pinola declined comment on what circumstances might move
him to rekindle his bid for BankAmerica, saying only, "We
continue to monitor and look at a lot of things and a lot of
people continue to monitor and look at us."
    Banking analysts, however, consider another First
Interstate bid at BankAmerica a long shot, not likely to happen
any time soon.
    Pinola called his decision last month to withdraw his 3.25
billion dlr bid at the nation's second largest bank, "a very,
very difficult decision."
    With that decision made, however, he acknowledged First
Interstate may now have a difficult time keeping its number
four position in the California banking community.
    "The competition in this state is tough," he said, noting
CityBank's recent purchase of 50 financial service branches
from Sears Roebuck company. "CityBank is moving rapidly to move
us down to fifth and Wells Fargo down to fourth," he said.
    Outside California, Pinola acknowledged that Security
Pacific Corp, with its recent acquisitions in Arizona,
Washington and Oregon, is quickly becoming a regional
competitor in areas where First Interstate has long dominated.
    "Security is, has been and continues to be a highly
profitable and obviously well managed company," he said.
    He added, however, First Interstate, at the moment, has the
advantages of having owned and managed regional banks longer
and has the recognition advantage of having given its regional
banks a common name.
    Pinola said while its coastal state banks are in good
financial condition, First Interstate continues to sustain
serious loan losses in its Rocky Mountain states, where energy,
real estate and agriculture dominate the economy.
    Asked if he thought loan losses in those areas had peaked,
he said, "I don't think it has bottomed out, because I think
most of the problems are real estate-related and the real
estate problems are going to be with us for several years."
    Pinola said another failing economic sector, agriculture in
the Midwest, has slowed expansion of First Interstate's
franchise operation.
    First Interstate has 42 franchise banks that offer First
Interstate financial services in ten states.
    While a year ago he was considering taking his franchise
operation east of the Mississippi River, Pinola said because
most of the franchise banks are now in the West, expansion into
the Midwest must come first.
    Calling the franchise system, "moderately profitable,"
Pinola said, "It is going to take a rejuvenation of the
agriculture sector for us to commence franchising at the speed
we were generating before the last year or two."
    On the banking industry in general, Pinola said he thinks
1987 will be another bad year for loan losses, with only banks
with minimal holdings in real estate able to improve profits.

Bear, Stearns and Co.
    The initial rate for the notes will be set on April 15 at

After that, the rate will be reset quarterly.

floaters denominated in a foreign currency are a new wrinkle on
Wall Street.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Senate voted unanimously to seek
an expedited U.S. probe of Canadian tariffs on corn imports to
determine if the United States should retaliate.
    By 99 to 0, the Senate went on record against the 84.9
cents per bushel tariff approved by the Canadian Import
Tribunal.
    The non binding measure asked for a probe by the U.S. Trade
Representative to determine within 30 days whether the tariff
violates the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and if so
recommend within 60 days to President Reagan retaliatory action
against Canada.

<TITLE>BRAZIL SUGGESTS 60-DAY SHORT-TERM CREDIT EXTENSION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRASILIA, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil today suggested to its foreign
bank creditors an extension of short-term credit lines for 60
days until May 31, a spokesman for the Central Bank said.
    He said that with the move, called a "standstill"
arrangement, Brazil was only trying to avoid difficulties in
paying its 109 billion dlrs of debt in the future.
    The spokesman told Reuters that Brazil's suggestion will be
communicated by telex to Brazil's 700 bank creditors. He
declined to give details of the statement, but said Central
Bank president Francisco Gros was seeking a 60-day extension of
short-term credit lines from its commercial bank creditors.
    The amount of these credit lines totals 15 billion dlrs,
and deadline for payment is set for March 31.
    Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said in a television
interview that it was "absolutely important" for Brazil and its
creditors to renew the short-term credit lines, as Brazil must
finance its exports.
    "If these credit lines were cut, we would face difficulties
to honour our foreign debt in the future," Funaro said.
    "There is evidently a common interest in the matter," he
said.
    Funaro said, however, he was told creditors understand
Brazil's position and do not wish to make the negotiation for
the renewal of the credit lines more difficult.
    Funaro explained that Brazil's suggestion is part of its
demands "before the need to renew the mechanisms of loans in the
world."
    He said that the current negotiating process is "very
complex and complicated," mentioning cases of countries which
had to wait some 10 months before getting a reply from
creditors.
    "We are not interested in confrontation, but we would like
the loan mechanisms to show that the crisis belongs to both
sides," Funaro said.
    Funaro denied rumours that he had offered his resignation
to President Jose Sarney.
    "Who decides whether to keep or dismiss his ministers is the
president. Everything else is nothing but speculation," he said.
    Brazil last month suspended interest payments on its 68-
billion dlrs of debt to commercial banks and froze short-term
trade and money market lines.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poor's Corp said it
downgraded 360 mln dlrs of debt of Fluor Corp and its units
Fluor Finance N.V. and St. Joe Minerals Corp.
    Cut were the firms' senior debt to BB from BBB and the
parent's commercial paper to B from A-2.
    S and P cited industry overcapacity and weak pricing
conditions in Fluor's core businesses. It said profitability
and cash flow protection are not expected to rebound in the
foreseeable future to levels that would support the former
ratings. Restructuring has not compensated for a greater than
anticipated deterioration in market conditions, S and P said.

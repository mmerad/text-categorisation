<TITLE>DUTCH SUGAR BEET PLANTING HALF FINISHED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROTTERDAM, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Roughly half of this year's expected
130,000 hectare Dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground,
a spokesman for Suiker Unie, the largest sugar processor in the
Netherlands, told Reuters.
    Conditions are generally good and the average sowing date
for the crop is expected to be around April 11, against April
23 last year, and a 10-year average of April 14, the spokesman
added.
    "It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we can
expect when it comes to harvest in September, but at least the
crop is off to a very good start," he said.
    Last year, the Netherlands planted a record 137,600
hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of
white sugar, substantially more than the country's combined "A"
and "B" quota of 872,000 tonnes.
    This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has been
introduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000
hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000
tonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota "C" sugar produced.
    Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have been
allotted quotas. This is expected to prevent the area being
boosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar.

<TITLE>VOLKSWAGEN DIVIDEND DECISION DUE TOMORROW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WOLFSBURG, West Germany, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F>,
VW, is due to make a formal announcement about its 1986
dividend tomorrow after saying the 1985 level of 10 marks per
ordinary share would be held, despite massive losses because of
a suspected foreign currency fraud.
    A spokesman said VW's supervisory board will meet tomorrow
to discuss the payout.  A statement will be made afterwards.
    VW has also said disclosed profits for 1986 will reach
their 1985 level, despite provisions of a possible 480 mln
marks linked to the currency affair. The figure is virtually
the same as the 477 mln mark 1985 parent company net profit.
    When VW first confirmed the currency scandal on March 10 it
said the management board would propose an unchanged 10-mark
dividend to the supervisory board. A dividend of 11 marks would
be proposed for the company's new preference shares.
    Share analysts said they saw supervisory board approval of
the management board proposal as virtually a formality.
"Anything else would be more than a surprise," one said.
    Company sources said VW would have to dig into reserves to
maintain the disclosed profit. Parent company reserves stood at
around three billion marks at end-1985.

<TITLE>ZAMBIA DOES NOT PLAN RETAIL MAIZE PRICE HIKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUSAKA, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Zambian government has no immediate
plans to follow last week's increase in the producer price of
maize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal, an
official of the ruling party said.
    Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for
refined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots in
which at least 15 people died.
    That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda later
revoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) to reduce the government's subsidy bill.
    However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67
dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail price
increase, the government will have to spend more on subsidies,
a practice discouraged by the IMF.
    "There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of
meal. It (the government) would have to choose between the
demands of the IMF and those of the people," a Ministry of
Agriculture economist said.

<TITLE>FURTHER ARGENTINE COARSE GRAIN LOSSES FEARED</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Manuel Villanueva</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BUENOS AIRES, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Argentine grain producers adjusted
their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop
downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the
end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said.
    They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates
had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which
has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.
    However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend,
producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain
could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.
    Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27
millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in
Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in
Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.
    There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.
    Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce
rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the
crops, including soybean.
    However, as the lands began drying later in the week
harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40
pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.
    Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested
material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield
estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.
    The season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at
2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast
last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of
4.1 mln.
    Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9
to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.
    Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area
sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will
begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.
    Production estimates for maize were down from last week at
9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated
previously.
    This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln
tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and
21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln
tonnes.
    Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to
seven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln.
    Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in
Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and
Buenos Aires in mid-April.
    The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3
to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.
    The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln
tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week,
and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2
mln tonne crop.
    The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted,
remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5
pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for
1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of
7.1 mln.
    The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln
to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln
sown in 1985/86.
    The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some
areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some
experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas
making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on
this were not available.
    Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which
will be sown between May and August or September, has so far
not been as intense as in previous years.

<DATELINE>    THE HAGUE, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dutch seasonally adjusted unemployment
rose in the month to end-March to a total 693,000 from 690,600
at end-February, but was well down from 730,100 at end-March
1986, Social Affairs Ministry figures show.
    The figure for male jobless rose by 2,000 in the month to
436,500 compared with 470,700 a year earlier. The figure for
women was 256,500 at end-March against 256,100 a month earlier
and 259,400 at end-March 1986.
    On an unadjusted basis total unemployment fell by 16,500 in
the month to end-March to 692,200. In March 1986 the figure was
725,000.
    A ministry spokesman said the unadjusted figures showed a
smaller than usual seasonal decrease for the time of year,
because of particularly cold weather delaying work in the
building industry. He said this explained the increase in the
adjusted statistics.
    Total vacancies available rose by 1,900 to 26,300 at
end-March. A year earlier the figure was 28,763.

affirmed the long-term debt ratings but cut the commercial
paper to Prime-2 from Prime-1 of Avco Financial Services Inc, a
unit of Avco Corp.
    Avco Financial has 2.5 billion dlrs of debt outstanding.
    For the paper cut, Moody's cited a higher risk profile
inherent in the company's core business. Moody's said the
affirmation reflected its assessment of a less diversified risk
profile in the company's receivables.
    Affirmed were Avco Financial's A-3 senior debt, Baa-2
senior subordinated debt and Baa-3 junior subordinated debt.

nations arrived at the U.S. Treasury main building to begin a
meeting of the Group of Five.
    Officials seen arriving by Reuter correspondents included
West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank
President Karl Otto Poehl, French Finance Minister Edouard
Balladur and his central banker Jacques de Larosiere.
    Also seen arriving were Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa and Japan's central bank governor Satoshi Sumita and
British Chancellor of the Exchequer and central bank governor
Robin Leigh Pemberton.
    There was no immediate sign of Italian or Canadian
officials. Monetary sources have said a fully blown meeting of
the Group of Seven is expected to begin around 3 p.m. local
time (1900 gmt) and last at least until 6 p.m. (2200 gmt), when
a communique is expected to be issued.
    Italian sources said Italian acting Finance Minister
Giovanni Goria met Treasury Secretary James Baker last night.
    At those talks Baker apparently convinced Goria, who
declined to attend the February meeting of the Group of Seven
in Paris, that Italy would participate fully in any meaningful
decisions.

agreements, economists said.
    Economists expect the Fed to execute 2.0-2.5 billion dlrs

for a permanent reserve injection to offset seasonal pressures
via an outright purchase of bills or coupons this afternoon.

floating rate dividends at 72 pct of prime and to 12.75 dlrs a
share on retraction.
    Continental said the initial payout was subject to Canadian
government approval.
    The bank reiterated that total distributions to common
shareholders would range from 16.50 dlrs a share to 17.25 dlrs
including the initial stock dividend and a final distribution
in late 1988 or early 1989.
    The payout of existing preferred shareholders will be
completed just before next month's initial distribution to
common shareholders, Continental added.

<TITLE>ENERGY/U.S. PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By JULIE VORMAN, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S.
dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will
propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record
profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990,
major company executives predicted.
    This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an
industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF
Corp &lt;GAF>, privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms
to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants.
    Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc &lt;ASH>, the
Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for
money-making petrochemical businesses to buy.
    "I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period," said
Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW>, adding,
"There's no major plant capacity being added around the world
now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving
the old ones."
    Analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers,
automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of
paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year.
    U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about
90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike
product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher,
managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand
for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up
by as much as 300 pct, he said.
    Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in
Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned
last year and predicted it would have the best year in its
history.
    In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel
and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S.
dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. "I believe the entire
chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,"
Oreffice said.
    GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical
industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987.
Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion
dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985.
    The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical
industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and
planning, said Pace's John Dosher.
    Dosher said last year's fall in oil prices made feedstocks
dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar
was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost
U.S. chemical exports.
    Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has
been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical
manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers
in the early 1980s.
    Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers
have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program
to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate
unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of
friendly and hostile takeover attempts.
    GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire
Union Carbide Corp &lt;UK>, recently offered three billion dlrs
for Borg Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics
and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace &lt;GRA> 
has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer
businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions.
    But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be
headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on
the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as
ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that
are custom-designed for a small group of buyers.
    "Companies like DuPont &lt;DD> and Monsanto Co &lt;MTC> spent the
past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity
chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had
deteriorated," Dosher said. "But I think they will eventually
kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche
market." Some top chemical executives share the concern.
    "The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting
carried away and repeating past mistakes," GAF's Heyman
cautioned. "The shift from commodity chemicals may be
ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long."
    Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the
Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700
mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend.
    Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout
of Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1
billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants
along the Texas Gulf Coast.
    The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that
are the building blocks of specialty products.
    "This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a
glamorous, high-margin business," Cain said, adding that demand
is expected to grow by about three pct annually.
    Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said
chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for
plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood
and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical
business could last as long as four or five years, provided the
U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.

<TITLE>DOMINION CALLS BURLINGTON &lt;BUR> REPORT RUMOR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Dominion Textile Inc> considers a
published report that it has bought a stake in Burlington
Industries Inc and is considering making a joint bid for the
company to be a rumor, a company spokesman said.
    "As far as I am concerned and the company is concerned, they
are rumors and we're not commenting on rumors," spokesman Michel
Dufour told Reuters in response to a query.
    "All the information that has been given out publicly is
that, yes, Dominion Textile is interested in making an
acquisition that big...probably based on that people are
starting all sorts of rumors," he said.
    Dufour said yes when asked whether the report was only a
rumor, but said the company was not prepared to comment
further. Dominion Textile president and chairman Thomas Bell
was out of town and unavailable for comment.
    Dominion Textile last year made an unsuccesful 104-mln-
U.S.-dlr bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120-mln-
U.S.-dlr line of credit to be used for an American acquisition.
    Dufour said the company has been negotiating with "many"
U.S. textile companies but would not say whether Burlington
Industries was one of them.
    Burlington's stock rose sharply this morning on the report,
which said Dominion Textile had joined with U.S. investor Asher
Edelman to buy a stake in the company and to consider making a
takeover offer.
    Dominion Textile, which reported operating profit of 11.1
mln Canadian dlrs last year on sales of 926.5 mln dlrs, has
repeatedly said it will concentrate on expanding into the U.S. 
   The company has said it plans to diversify into new product
and market areas in addition to expanding its textile
operations.

its first quarter net to 101.8 mln dlrs reflected improved
operations and a lower effective tax rate.
    The company said revenue gains in electronics, major
appliances and other lines were offset by decreases in energy
services and aircraft products. Revenues in the quarter rose
1.4 pct to 1.75 billion dlrs, it said.
    The company said backlog stood at 7.520 billion dlrs, down
from 7.912 billion dlrs a year earlier. It said a five year
3.55 billion dlr U.S. defense contract was awarded shortly
after the close of the first quarter.

<TITLE>COCOA EXPORTERS EXPECTED TO LIMIT SALES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Roger May, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    YAOUNDE, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Major cocoa exporters are likely to
limit sales in the weeks ahead in an effort to boost world
prices, sources close to a meeting of the Cocoa Producers
Alliance (CPA) said.
    The sources said the depressed world market had been one of
the main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the
11-member CPA which began on Monday.
    They said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid the
buffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in his
effort to support prices.
    Major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreed
operation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in London
last month and the stock manager is expected to enter the
market soon.
    Prices, under the weight of three successive cocoa
surpluses, recently fell to the level at which the manager has
to buy cocoa under stock rules.
    The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre-set range
by buying when prices fall and selling when they rise.
    "The world's cocoa price at present is just not interesting,"
commented one delegate representing a major CPA producer.
    Another source said that with much of the 1986/87
(October-September) world cocoa crop sold, limiting sales in
the near term concerns essentially next year's harvest.
    The sources noted, however, that the cocoa industry in
Brazil, the world's number two producer, is in private hands.
This means limiting sales is more difficult than in major West
African producers, where sales are made or authorized by
commodity marketing boards.
    The CPA includes the world's top three producers, Ivory
Coast, Brazil and Ghana, and accounts for 80 pct of all output.
    The meeting here is due to end tomorrow evening.

<TITLE>J.P. MORGAN &lt;JPM> NET HURT BY BRAZIL, TRADING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its
first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its
previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status
its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil.
    That decision, spurred by Brazil's suspension of interest
payments on February 20, reduced the quarter's net income by 20
mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the
first three months of 1986.
    Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities
underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln
dlrs in the year-earlier period.
    In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading
losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and
underwriting of Euromarket securities.
    Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained
difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering
heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether
Morgan's trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket.
    On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan
losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign
exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and
trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln.
    Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and
commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net
investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln.
    Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first
quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell
to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct.
    If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means
that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are
actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9
mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume
payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added.
    After the provision for loan losses, Morgan's allowance for
credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared
with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier.
    It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after
charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49
mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier.
    Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarter's end were
583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year
earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from
303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to
personnel costs, Morgan said.

<TITLE>BRAZIL GRAIN HARVEST FACES STORAGE PROBLEMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAO PAULO, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Storage problems with Brazil's record
grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln
tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said.
    Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia,
told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this
year's estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost.
    He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in
harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage
problems.
    Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes,
theoretically sufficient for the crop.
    But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly
distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do
Sul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but were
responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.
    The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West
growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage
capacity.
    Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and
maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grains
production but only 20 pct of its storage space.
    In addition to the poor distribution of storage units,
there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to
storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for
storing loose grain, Brito said.
    Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the
crops.
    The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop
has been evident from television reports, which have shown
enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Exchanges and telecommunications
authorities should abolish their restrictions on full and free
dissemination of information to the investment and banking
communities, Reuters Holdings Plc &lt;RTRS.L> chairman Sir
Christopher Hogg said.
    In the 1986 annual repoprt, he said lengthy negotiations
had brought agreement with the Tokyo and London Stock Exchanges
for fuller, but still not complete, access to market data
through Reuter services.
    "Many other markets maintain restrictions," he added.
    Hogg said members of some markets appear to believe that
information restrictions protected their interests.
    In other cases, exchanges seem to be limiting the
distribution of data in order to provide competitive advantage
to their own commercial information businesses.
    He also noted that despite increasing liberalisation in the
telecommunications field, some countries continue to protect
their state monopolies at the expense of other economic
sectors.
    "Reuter dealing services remain excluded from such
countries. As a result, banking communities serving entire
economies are put at a competitive disadvantage," he added.
    Reuters increased its 1986 pre-tax profit by 39 pct from
the previous year to 130.1 mln stg on a 43 pct rise in revenues
to 620.9 mln stg.
    Earnings per ordinary share were up 47 pct to 19.4p. The
annual shareholder meeting will be held in London on April 29.

<TITLE>PARIS GROUP PUBLISHING DAILY FRANC TIN PRICE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Association of White Metals has
decided to publish a daily tin price here in French francs per
100 kilos, the French Federation of Non-Ferrous Metals said.
    The price, quoted for the first time yesterday, was
introduced as the lack of tin quotes was causing problems for
some French companies, a spokesman for the non-ferrous metals
association said.
    Today's price was set at 4,776 francs per 100 kilos and
Tuesday's at 4,790.
    The International Chamber of Commerce stopped publishing a
tin price after the London Metal Exchange (LME) stopped tin
trading on October 24, 1985.
    The Association has tested the basis it uses to calculate a
French franc price over the last few months to ensure it was
reliable, the spokesman said.
    The French franc price is pre-tax, for specified quality, a
minimum 99.9 pct purity, at a French port or border railway
station and a minimum delivery of 10 tonnes.
    The French Federation of Non-Ferrous Metals groups various
metal associations including the Association of White Metals.

<TITLE>MONTEDISON'S AGRIMONT UNIT 1986 EARNINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Montedison SPA> of Italy said net
consolidated profit for its Agrimont Group, formed in June
1986, totalled 1.5 billion lire in 1986.
    Agrimont SPA, the holding company for Montedison's
Agro-Industrial businesses, had sales of 810 billion lire and a
net profit of about 1.1 billion lire, after amortization costs
of 35 billion lire and a 13 billion lire reduction in the value
of inventory due to falling market prices, Montedison said.
    Agrimont, still wholly owned by Montedison, is taking steps
to be traded on the Milan exchange, the company said.
    The company said that 1986 was characterized by an unstable
fertlizer market due to the weak dollar and the decline of
international prices for products sold in Europe and the U.S
where Agrimont operates through its Conserv division.
    In pesticides and in animal health care products Agrimont
maintained its previous level of revenues and market share in
1986, Montedison said.
    Montedison said it named Ettore dell'Isola to the newly
created position of president of Agrimont.
    Montedison also said it named Renato Picco, managing
director of &lt;Eridania SPA> and Gianfranco Ceroni, managing
director of &lt;Italiana Olii e Sifi>, both of whom are members
of the the Ferruzzi Group's management board, to Argimont's
board of directors. Ferruzzi owns about 40 pct of Montedison,
the company said.

<TITLE>POLAND REASSURES CREDITORS ON ECONOMIC REFORMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Plans to rejuvenate Poland's economy
by reducing central government control would help reassure
Western creditors that the country's economy was safe to invest
in, a senior Polish official said.
    "The business of granting loans to Poland is not as bad a
business as you might imagine," senior Polish government
spokesman Jerzy Urban told a news conference in Stockholm.
    Urban, visiting the Swedish capital to deliver a lecture at
the Foreign Policy Institute, announced earlier this week that
Poland would soon offer shares to private citizens in state
companies in a bid to make the economy more responsive.
    This was part of a major economic reform to be announced in
the coming weeks, he said.
    Urban said the main problem with his country's foreign debt
burden of 32 billion dollars was short term interest charges
but  the long term looked more secure.
    He said he hoped talks under way with the Paris Club,
grouping Poland's main government creditors, would shortly
solve the problem of short term servicing.
    Urban told reporters that debt servicing was hampering the
expansion of the national economy, but that the new plans for
economic reform would "open new vistas for Polish exports."
    He criticised the blocking efforts of some Western
governments, whom he declined to name, for putting political
considerations ahead of economic co-operation.
    "After the lifting of U.S. Sanctions against the Polish
economy we considered all political obstacles had been removed,
but that has not been the case," Urban said.

<TITLE>TALKING POINT/BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES &lt;BUR></TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Patti Domm, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    New York, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The largest U.S. textile maker focused
on its own business as its competitors found merger partners,
but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself
into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said.
    The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose
4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and
Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct
stake.
    A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly
acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover
offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for
Montreal-based Dominion called the report just "rumors."
    Burlington said it did not know if the report was true.
    Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of
the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if
Burlington actually came into play.
    Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however,
added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it
was looking for a takeover in the U.S.
    Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills
and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for
a U.S. acquisition.
    A Dominion spokesman said Canada's largest textile producer
has been negotiating with "many" U.S. textile companies, but
would not say whether Burlington was among them.
    "There have been acquisitions in this area. It's not
unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the
housecleaning they've done," said Eileen Gormley of Thomson
McKinnon.
    Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets
and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs
last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its
operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign
competition, Gormley said.
    "They've pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer,"
said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial
fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets
and other fabric to the auto industry.
    "In the past, they just spent and never realized the return
on the outlays they did make," she said.
    "You look at their record over the year, and I think
they're poised to be more profitable than they had been in the
past," Gormley said.
     She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up
from 2.01 dlrs per share.
    Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington
at its current levels.
    Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends
selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50
dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings
basis.
    Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been
placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share.
    "After Asher's (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people
don't find him very credible anymore," said one arbitrager.
    Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing
managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if
he doesn't win the target company.
    Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky
Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying
Ponderosa Inc.
    The stocks of other textile makers rose along with
Burlington.
    J.P. Stevens &lt;STN> climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest
Cannon Inc &lt;FLD>, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and
Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4. West Point-Pepperell Inc &lt;WPM>
rose 1-7/8 to 67-1/8.

<TITLE>JAPAN IN LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO AVERT TARIFFS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Robert Trautman, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Senior Japanese officials tomorrow
open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch
effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide
variety of Japanese electronic exports.
    Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japan's Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of
meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael
Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart.
    The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in
retaliation for Japan's failure to adhere to an agreement to
end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and
to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments.
    They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors,
including television and audio equipment and computers.
    Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little
likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct
duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments.
    President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27
after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986
U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that
Japan was not honoring the agreement.
    In making the annoucement, Reagan said "I am committed to
the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to
provide American industry with free and fair trade."
    Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japan's
semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured
the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has
complained about presidential timidity on trade issues.
    Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive
trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagan's
inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last
year reached 169.8 billion dlrs.
    About one-third of the deficit was with Japan.
    Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to
adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it.
    Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals
but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation.
    He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagan's
decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense
of MITI's power to control Japanese traders.
    "The United States has excessive expectations.," he said. To
stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by
excess inventories since 1985 will take some time."
    He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough
in trying to sell in the Japanese market.

sent propsective customers a confidential report describing its
polyester textile fiber facilities in North Carolina and South
Carolina.
    The company did not disclose any prices.
    The report describes the facilities in Darlington County,
S.C., and Fayetteville, N.C., the company said. The report also
decribes related manufacturing, marketing, administrative and
technical resources that could be made avialable to a buyer.
    Hoechst Celanese was formed Feb 27 by the merger of
Celanese Corp and American Hoechst Corp. The merger took place
after an agreement was reached with the Federal Trade
Commission that certain domestic polyester textile fiber assets
of the combined companies would be divested, it said.
    Hoechst Celanese said it has the option of divesting either
the South Carolina facilities of the former American Hoechst or
a package of polyester textile fiber facilities of the former
Celanese.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>A Treasury official said there are no
plans to try to reduce the U.S. budget deficit by issuing
yen-denominated bonds that would become known as "Reagan bonds."
    "It simply isn't something that we are planning to do," the
official said.
    He added the Treasury was aware of Japanese news reports
suggesting the Reagan administration might issue such bonds as
the former Carter administration did when it sold "Carter bonds"
denominated in West German marks.
    But he said the situation was greatly different now.
    "If you look at the differences between the treasury market
now and in the Carter administration years, it is a much more
global market now," the official said.
    "There was not the same ease then for the holder of another
currency to buy other countries' securities," he added, "But
there is no difficulty now for them to purchase dollars and buy
U.S. securities."
    The United States needs dollars, not Japanese yen, to pay
its debts and reduce the deficit and so has no plans to issue
yen-denominated bonds, he emphasized.

Fitzwater said U.S. trade sanctions against Japan were likely
take effect on April 17 in spite of a "full court press" by
Japanese officials to avoid them.
    "All indications are they will take effect," he said.
    "I would say Japan is applying the full court press ... They
certainly are putting both feet forward in terms of explaining
their position," Fitzwater told reporters.
    He noted high level meetings on the trade dispute are

contracts will be reduced by 25 pct as from Friday, April 10,
taking the required deposit for one 10 tonne lot to 300 stg
from 400 previously, a spokesman for the International
Commodity Clearing House (ICCH) said.
    The deposit for spread contracts will be similarly cut, to
150 stg for a one 10 tonne lot from 200 previously, he said.
    The ICCH had been looking at cocoa market fluctuations over
a period of weeks, he said, adding the market's basic stability
had warranted a cut in deposit rates.
    The decision to cut deposits was taken by the ICCH after
consultation with the London Cocoa Terminal Market, the
spokesman said.
    The cuts were likely to attract more business to the
market, he said.

<TITLE>HEINEKEN SEES HIGHER PROFITS, WIDER PENETRATION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Emma Robson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    AMSTERDAM, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dutch brewer Heineken NV said it hoped
to maintain for a number of years a similar earnings growth to
the 7.5 pct increase in net profit achieved in 1986, despite
continuing investments in a reorganization program and efforts
to extend world penetration.
    Heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mln
guilders, after 265 mln in 1985.
    Chairman Freddie Heineken said the company, Europe's
leading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986,
said sales increased by 6.3 pct to 42.1 mln hectoliters.
    The volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the U.S.,
Where the brand Amstel Lite saw great demand, and in Europe,
where sales accounted for 25.5 pct of the total.
    Turnover, despite losses in guilder terms due to weaker
foreign currencies, rose by 4.4 pct, to 6.7 billion guilders.
    Further consolidation of foreign companies, including the
increase of its stake in leading Spanish brewery &lt;El Aguila
S.A.> to 51.2 pct, new ventures and modernization, particularly
in French and Spanish interests, eroded profit margins. The
company still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in
restructuring and marketing, Heineken said.
    Heineken's Spanish activities should start yielding profit
next year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations had
already turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.
    Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the
European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer
into the closed West German market -- Europe's biggest beer
market -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. "We
have the beer, but distribution and sales is the important
point," van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heineken
had been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures.
    "The question is not if we want to penetrate the German
market, but how we are to do it," van Schaik said, adding that
while the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a
taste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very
regionalized.
     Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible for
African operations, said he saw Africa as one of the most
important beer growth markets in the long term.
     He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and with
majority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was
hampered by the lack of hard currencies there.
    Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters
per head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions
and currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total
1986 sales.
    On-site production is rendered expensive by the high price
of imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientists
have been looking at other possibilities.
    To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched on
the Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which
had sold successfully, Coebergh said.
    Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw
materials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were
popular in Rwanda . "This is a possibility, but we could not
possibly achieve the Heineken flavor," Coebergh said.
    Chairman Heineken said the company's seven year efforts to
penetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a
contract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.
    But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken's
market potential. Heineken now has seven bars in Moscow that
are enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept western
money.

<TITLE>COLOMBIA BUSINESS ASKED TO DIVERSIFY FROM COFFEE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOGOTA, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>A Colombia government trade official has
urged the business community to aggressively diversify its
activities and stop relying so heavily on coffee.
    Samuel Alberto Yohai, director of the Foreign Trade
Institute, INCOMEX, said private businessmen should not become
what he called "mental hostages" to coffee, traditionally
Colombia's major export.
    The National Planning Department forecast that in 1987
coffee will account for only one-third of total exports, or
about 1.5 billion dlrs, with oil and energy products making up
another third and non-traditional exports the remainder.

<TITLE>TURKEY CALLS FOR DIALOGUE TO SOLVE DISPUTE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ANKARA, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Turkey said today its disputes with
Greece, including rights on the continental shelf in the Aegean
Sea, should be solved through negotiations.
    A Foreign Ministry statement said the latest crisis between
the two NATO members stemmed from the continental shelf dispute
and an agreement on this issue would effect the security,
economy and other rights of both countries.
    "As the issue is basicly political, a solution can only be
found by bilateral negotiations," the statement said. Greece has
repeatedly said the issue was legal and could be solved at the
International Court of Justice.
    The two countries approached armed confrontation last month
after Greece announced it planned oil exploration work in the
Aegean and Turkey said it would also search for oil.
    A face-off was averted when Turkey confined its research to
territorrial waters. "The latest crises created an historic
opportunity to solve the disputes between the two countries,"
the Foreign Ministry statement said.
    Turkey's ambassador in Athens, Nazmi Akiman, was due to
meet Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou today for the Greek
reply to a message sent last week by Turkish Prime Minister
Turgut Ozal. The contents of the message were not disclosed.

<TITLE>GATT OFFICIAL MEETS WITH U.S. FARM LEADERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The official in charge of
agricultural matters in the new round of global trade talks is
in Washington today and tomorrow to meet with congressional and
Reagan administration officials.
    Aart de Zeeuw, chairman of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade's negotiating group on agriculture, met this morning
with members of the House Agriculture Committee.
    Committee sources said De Zeeuw expressed concern over
protectionism and high farm price supports. House lawmakers
noted that in 1985 the United States took steps to reduce loan
rates, committee staff said.
    "Members told him (De Zeeuw) that we lowered our (U.S.) loan
rates and can't eliminate subsidies unilaterally," one source
said.
    De Zeeuw was told of the U.S. lawmakers' frustration with
Japan's restrictive rice import policy, and members defended
the U.S. dairy policy, which aims to cut surplus production by
subsidizing producers to trim herds, sources said.
    Later today De Zeeuw will meet the Senate Agriculture
members and Undersecretary of State Affairs Allen Wallis.
    Tomorrow, De Zeeuw is to meet the House Ways and Means
Trade Subcommittee and the Senate Finance Committee, before
visiting Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng.
    De Zeeuw goes to Canada later this week. His trip to North
America is part of his attempt to meet farm policy leaders in
the key GATT member states.
    The negotiating group on agriculture held its first meeting
in February and is expected to meet again in May.

<TITLE>J.P. MORGAN&lt;JPM> SAYS DLR MAY PREVENT FED EASING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The relatively high level of real U.S.
interest rates suggests that there is scope for further
declines in money market rates, but the Federal Reserve is
unlikely to promote such a drop as long as the dollar remains
volatile, said J.P. Morgan and Co Inc chairman Lewis Preston.
    He said in response to a reporter's question after the
bank's annual meeting that money market rates could decline
further but, "I don't think the Fed is going to encourage that
as long as the exchange markets are as volatile as they are."
    On the other hand, he said that, barring a collapse of the
dollar, he did not see rates going much higher.
    He said that Morgan's recent rise in its prime lending rate
was "purely a reflection of an increase in a whole spectrum of
rates."
    Preston reiterated earlier company forecasts that the U.S.
economy should show roughly 2.5 to three pct real growth this
year.
    He also said that as a consequence of the dollar's decline
and oil price rises, inflation would rise "moderately" to a 3.5
to four pct rate in 1987.

<TITLE>MEDTRONIC &lt;MDT> SEES 15 PCT EARNINGS GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Medtronic Inc said it sees 15 pct
growth in sales and earnings for the year ending April 30,
1988.
    At an analysts meeting here the company said that for the
year ending April 30, 1987 it will earn about 73 mln dlrs, or
about 5.15-5.35 dlrs a share on sales of about 500 mln dlrs.
    In the year ago period, the company earned 53.4 mln dlrs,
or 3.65 dlrs a share, on sales of 402.8 mln dlrs.
    Winston Wallin, Medtronic chairman, said the company will
improve market share in fiscal 1988 in cardiac pacemakers and
expand its cardiovascular therapeutic product line.
    Wallin cautioned analysts not to quickly change their per
share estimates for the company as he said Medtronic will have
heavy sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 1988.
    He said the company intends to reinvest its earnings in its
businesses and not in its dividends. "Shareholders are better
off if we grow the business rather than reinvest in dividends
or share repurchases," he said.
    Wallin said he sees Medtronic's share of the total
worldwide pacemaker market increasing to 42 pct in fiscal 1988,
from 40 pct in fiscal 1987.
    He said the worldwide market for cardiovascualr therapeutic
products, which includes pacemakers, valves, catheters and
lasers, will be valued at about 2.5 billion dlrs 1990 and will
double that by 1995.
    Wallin said, "Our objective is to get a hold of new
products and start building market share if we have to beg,
borrow or steal to get into new markets."
    In the past, Medtronic's pacemakers have been plagued with
a number of problems leading to product recalls. Regulators
also have criticized the industry, citing quality problems and
a needless overprescription of pacemakers.
    "We have no knowledge of any major problems in our
pacemakers or leads," Wallin said. "We intend to re-establish
our company as the quality leader in the industry."
    Glen Nelson, executive vice president for Medtronics, said
the company intends to diversify internally and through
acquisitions of companies in areas of Medtronic's expertise,
such as drug delivery systems.
    Wallin said the 15 pct earnings growth for fiscal 1988 does
not include dilutions from acquisitions. "We hope to have some
safety provisions so that we won't have any major dilutions
from an acquisition."
    Wallin also said the company will have virtual exclusivity
in rate responsive pacemakers for all of fiscal 1988.
    The company markets Activitrax, the first single chamber
pacemaker that varies heartrate in response to physical
activity.
    Siemens AG, a West German company, is also developing a
rate responsive pacemaker.

the sixth International Tin Agreement (ITA) began at the
quarterly session of the International Tin Council (ITC) but
the Council is still waiting for decisions from various member
states.
    A number of producer governments in particular have not
decided their final position on whether the ITA should be
extended for up to two years or wound down after it expires on
June 30, according to delegate sources.
    Earlier today European Community (EC) members decided to
back an extension, with the exception of Britain, which
undertook to communicate its decision to its EC partners later.
    Delegates said it could be Friday before all the member
countries declare their positions on the possible extension.
Today's full Council session started shortly before 1500 GMT
after the scheduled 1330 start was delayed by an EC
coordination meeting.
    The council reconvenes at 0930 GMT tomorrow, although
delegates said the morning is likely to be taken up with minor
technical matters and the main issue will probably not be
discussed before the afternoon session.

emergency provisions of a July 1986 semiconductor pact to
discuss trade and the punitive tariffs.
    Fitzwater said: "I would say Japan is applying the

indications are they (the tariffs) will take effect."

<TITLE>SHOWBOAT &lt;SBO> TO TAKE CHARGE, SEES 3RD QTR LOSS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ATLANTIC CITY, N.J., April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Showboat Inc will take a
charge of 19 to 20 mln dlrs pretax against results for the
third quarter ended March 31, director and assistant to the
president J. Kell Houssels III told Reuters.
    He said the charge results from pre-operating expenses of
its recently-opened Atlantic City, N.J., Showboat Hotel, Casino
and Bowling Center and will cause a loss for the third quarter
and probably for all of fiscal 1987 as well.
    But Houssels said Showboat's earnings for fiscal 1988
should show a sharp increase from fiscal 1986 levels due to the
contribution of the new Atlantic City facility.
    Showboat earned 1,753,000 dlrs in last year's third
quarter.  For all of fiscal 1986 it earned 5,769,000 dlrs.
    Houssels said Showboat since the opening of the Atlantic
City hotel/casino, Showboat has had to start charging interest
expenses connected with debt it sold to finance the facility
directly against income rather than capitalizing the interest
as it had been able to do previously.
    Showboat opened the hotel during its third quarter and
gaming began last Thursday on a regular basis after test gaming
was completed earlier in the week.

    Despite the anticipated reduction to quarterly earnings,
Security Pacific said it still expects to report first quarter
earnings higher than the 88 mln dlrs, or 1.11 dlrs per share
reported for the first quarter of 1986.
    The bank holding company said the action affects 401 mln
dlrs of loans to Brazil and 73 mln of loans to Ecuador.
    Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs
of medium- and long-term debt on February 20.
    Ecuador, which has foreign debt of roughly eight billion
dlrs, has not paid any interest to foreign banks since
February.
    In March Ecuador said it would suspend interest payments
for the rest of the year because of an earthquake which halted
the export of oil, which accounts for about 75 pct the
country's export revenues.
    In its announcement, Security Pacific said it will record
interest income only as it is received in cash.
    The company also said it believes that Brazil will reach an
agreement with its banks and that interest payments will resume
later in 1987.
    The Brazilian negotiations resume on Friday in New York
when Central Bank Governor Francisco Gros is expected to ask
banks for a 90-day roll-over of some 9.5 billion dlrs of term
debt that matures on April 15.

<TITLE>IRAQI TROOPS REPORTED PUSHING BACK IRANIANS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BAGHDAD, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iraq said today its troops were pushing
Iranian forces out of positions they had initially occupied
when they launched a new offensive near the southern port of
Basra early yesterday.
    A High Command communique said Iraqi troops had won a
significant victory and were continuing to advance.
    Iraq said it had foiled a three-pronged thrust some 10 km
(six miles) from Basra, but admitted the Iranians had occupied
ground held by the Mohammed al-Qassem unit, one of three
divisions attacked.
    The communique said Iranian Revolutionary Guards were under
assault from warplanes, helicopter gunships, heavy artillery
and tanks.
    "Our forces are continuing their advance until they purge
the last foothold" occupied by the Iranians, it said.
    (Iran said its troops had killed or wounded more than 4,000
Iraqis and were stabilising their new positions.)
    The Baghdad communique said Iraqi planes also destroyed oil
installations at Iran's southwestern Ahvaz field during a raid
today. It denied an Iranian report that an Iraqi jet was shot
down.
    Iraq also reported a naval battle at the northern tip of
the Gulf. Iraqi naval units and forces defending an offshore
terminal sank six Iranian out of 28 Iranian boats attempting to
attack an offshore terminal, the communique said.

    Donald Houston, administrator of USDA's Food Safety and

USDA was developing a proposed change in regulations that would
put an end to the current practice of permitting foreign meat
products to be unloaded at one port and inspected at another

    Houston said the requirement would be phased in over
several years to "avoid disruptions and economic hardship."

<TITLE>UNION TEXAS OIL RESERVES DROPPED IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Union Texas Petroleum said its worldwide
proved reserves fell to 511 mln barrels of oil equivalent at
the end of 1986 from 555 mln barrels reported in 1985.
    In its newly released annual report, Union Texas said it
replaced about 71 pct of its production of 56 mln barrels of
oil equivalent last year after taking into account the sale of
27 mln barrels of U.S. reserves.
    Union Texas, the nation's largest independent oil and gas
producer based on revenues, is a privately-held company owned
by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co and Allied-Signal Inc &lt;ALD>.
    The Houston-based company said it lost 57.5 mln dlrs on
1.26 billion dlrs in sales last year, compared to profits of
165 mln dlrs on 2.04 billion dlrs in sales in 1985.
    Union Texas said it received an average of 13.35 dlrs per
barrel for its international oil production and 2.99 dlrs per
mcf for its foreign natural gas sales. The majority of the
company's total energy production is in the United Kingdom,
Indonesia and Pakistan.
    In the United States, Union Texas said it completed
evaluation work on its oil find in Alaska's Colville Delta
area.
    "Although significant oil reserves were confirmed,
development of this discovery will not be economical without
substantially higher prices," the company said.
    Union Texas said it planned to spend about 42 mln dlrs over
the next two years to develop its Eugene Island Block 371 in
the Gulf of Mexico.
    In 1987, the company said it budgeted 178 mln dlrs for
capital spending, less than half of the amount spent in 1985
and down from 199 mln dlrs budgeted last year. Union Texas also
said it would seek acquisitions of oil and gas properties as
well as petrochemical-related businesses.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>UAL &lt;UAL> MAY RESPOND TO PILOTS TODAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>UAL Inc may have a response this
afternoon to the pilots union proposal to buy its United
Airlines unit, a UAL spokesman said.
    "Obviously, we have a lot of movement in our stock, and we
need to get a clarification out," the spokesman said, adding
that there was a "50-50" chance a statement would be released
today.
    The pilots earlier this week offered to buy the airline for
2.3 billion dlrs, and assume 2.2 billion dlrs of existing debt.
    Takeover speculation has driven UAL's stock for several
weeks. UAL last month said New York Real estate developer
Donald Trump held a position in its stock, and that he also
held discussions with its chairman.
    The developer indicated in those talks that he took the
position as an investment, but he revealed no other plans.
    Today, rumors circulated that Coniston Partners were buying
UAL stock. UAL jumped five to 70-3/4 on volume of more than 3.2
mln shares.
    "United has got to consider this proposal. I think the
pilot's proposal is realistic. I don't exptect them to take it,
but it could put some interesting options in front of UAL
management," said Timothy Pettee, Bear Stearns and co analyst.
    Analysts have said UAL made itself vulnerable to attack
when it diversified away from its core airline. It added Hertz
rental cars, Westin and Hilton International hotels in a
strategy to become a travel service company.
    The strategy left its stock in a slump and its pilots union
concerned that the company was not focussing enough attention
on its airline.
    UAL has stood firm on its strategy. It is emphasizing its
new focus by changing its name to Allegis, as of May one.
    But takeover speculation has escalated, and Wall Street has
been busy calculating break up values well in excess of 100
dlrs per share. Traders today described the buying in UAL as
widespread, indicative to them that big institutions believe
the stock is in play.
    Market sources have said that although Trump attracted
attention to the stock, the pilots proposal acted as a
catalyst, kicking off a new round of speculation and perhaps
throwing the company into the hands of another buyer.
    "The first domino is you have an investor with a
considerable stake. the second domino is the union. That type
of attitude has been a precursor to airline deals in the past,"
said Pettee.
    "What's interesting is the values are there. There's
something for everybody," he said.

<TITLE>HARTMARX &lt;HMX> TARGETS EARNINGS GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hartmarx Corp, following a year of
restructuring, continues to target record earnings for fiscal
1987, Chairman John Meinert told the annual meeting.
    Meinert reiterated an earlier comment that earnings for the
remainder of the year must double the 1986 level to meet that
goal. In fiscal 1986, ended November 30, 1986, Hartmarx
reported earnings of 24.8 mln dlrs, or 1.20 dlrs a share, down
from the prior year's 42.7 mln dlrs, or 2.25 dlrs a share.
    The 110-year-old apparel manufacturer recently posted
first-quarter earnings of 54 cts a share, up from 40 cts a year
ago.
    Meinert told shareholders Hartmarx has no plans to sell any
of its divisions. He added, "We have the financial capacity to
take advantage of acquisitions."
    In 1987, Meinert said the company will open five new and 10
redesigned Kuppenheimer direct-to-consumer stores in Atlanta,
Detroit, St. Louis, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco.
    He said the company's women's apparel continues to grow,
and Hartmarx has on the drawing board a Briar concept store
which will feature ties, shirts and some tailored clothing.

<TITLE>FED'S HELLER SAYS MONETARY GROWTH TO BE SLOWER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Robert Heller, a member of the
Federal Reserve Board, said he expects "more modest levels" of
growth in the money supply this year.
    "In my view, this would not only be a logical, but also a
most desireable development," he said in a speech prepared for
delivery to an economic forum at Chapman College in Orange,
Calif.
    A text was released in Washington.
    He said the effect of lower inflation and financial
deregulation on monetary aggregates was now largely finished.
    "Consequently, monetary growth may return to more modest
levels," Heller said. He noted growth in the money supply slowed
after mid-January.
    "I would not be surprised at all if the monetary aggregates
were to grow rather slowly during the balance of the year as
well," he added.
    Heller said there was a danger of renewed price inflation.
    "The pricing behavior of American producers in response to
price increases of their foreign competitors will be crucial
for our economic future," he said.
    Widespread domestic price rises in response to rising
import prices would "generalize the inflationary forces
emanating from the foreign trade sector" and might not gain more
market share for U.S. producers.
    "A return to the stagflation of the late 1970s may well be
the result of such a behavior pattern," Heller warned.
    He said "we at the Federal Reserve will have to be
disciplined in our conduct of monetary policy." 
    Heller said said the government should also exercise fiscal
discipline and cut the deficit by spending restraint rather
than new taxes.
    "The imposition of new taxes would tend to rekindle
inflation and certainly would not make us more competitive in
international markets," Heller said.
    He said the U.S. economy should expand by nearly three pct
during 1987, aided by higher exports to Europe and Canada.
    A free trade agreement currently being negotiated with
Canada "would be exceedingly helpful in allowing American
producers to compete more effectively in that country," Heller
said.

<TITLE>U.S. MEAT, POULTRY INSPECTION CALLED FAULTY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. meat and poultry inspection
programs are incapable of protecting consumers from
contaminated products, groups representing inspectors and
consumers charged.
    "The whole trend of inspection for the last 10 years has
been to corrupt and to degrade the system where today the
public is at constant risk to contaminated and adulterated
meat," Kenneth Blaylock, president of the American Federation of
Government Employees, told a House Agriculture subcommittee.
    "The American consumer has little reason to feel confident
about the safety of meat and poultry being offered to him
today," said Rodney Leonard, executive director of the Community
Nutrition Institute.
    "Company management is less concerned about the risk to
health than about raising plant output and company profits,"
Leonard told a hearing of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on
Livestock, Dairy and Poultry.
    Kenneth Morrison, staff associate at the Government
Accountability Project, said inspectors consistently disclose
violations of federal law, demonstrating a "serious breakdown in
the entire inspection system."
    Morrison told of chicken fat for flavoring being
contaminated by "intestines dragging in a water trough used to
flush away the condemned product, fecal material, human spit,
chewing gum and paper towels used by plant employees to blow
their noses."
    Donald Houston, administrator of the U.S. Agriculture
Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service, FSIS, defended
the government's program, calling it "one of the most respected
public health programs in the world."
    FSIS inspects an estimated 127 mln head of cattle and 4.5
billion chicken and turkeys every year.
    Houston said inspection programs have kept pace with
change, but conceded that the danger of chemical residues in
the meat and poultry supply has increased.
    He also said that, although he was confident the bacterium
salmonella eventually could be eradicated, it would take time
and much money to contain the growing problem.
    Salmonella, which in extreme cases can cause death, is
found in approximately 37 pct of U.S. broilers, 12 pct of raw
pork and three to five pct of raw beef, Houston said.
    The number of reported cases has doubled over the past 20
years, he said, to 40,000 cases annually.
    "We certainly really have not found an effective means of
turning this disease around," said Rep. James Olin (D-Va.)
    The National Research Council recommended in 1985 that FSIS
intensify efforts to develop rapid diagnostic procedures for
detecting microoganisms.
    But the meat and poultry industries have said such controls
would cost too much.
    "Hopefully we will not overreact by installing unnecessarily
complicated procedures that may become obstacles to the real
goal of providing an increasingly safer, more nutritious and
economical meat supply for consumers," Stanley Emerling,
executive vice president of the National Association of Meat
Purveyors, said.
    Blaylock, speaking on behalf of food inspectors, said a new
program allowing elimination of USDA inspection functions at
certain plants "voids the law in letter and spirit, and must be
repealed or we will see rising consumer fraud and an epidemic
of death and illness for which there will be no prevention nor
legal recourse."
    Subcommittee Chairman Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.) said the
panel would hold a hearing on salmonella June 2.

<TITLE>CHRYSLER &lt;C> RENAULT DELAY AM MOTORS &lt;AMO> PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chrysler Corp and Regie Natiionale des
Usines Renault said they agreed to extend by up to two weeks
the period for reaching definitive agreement on Chrysler's
proposed 1.5 billion dlr takeover of American Motors Corp.
    The letter of intent signed by Chrysler and Renault on
March nine set April nine as the target date for completing
negotiations.
    However, the letter also allowed room for an extension of
that date to April 23 if an agreement could not be reached.
    The two companies said they "now plan to complete work by
April 23."
    Chrysler and Renault said, "Given the complex nature of the
deal, the need for additional time was to be expected."
    The March letter of intent between the two companies says
that Chrysler could ask Renault to extend the agreement date
"in the event that prior to April 9, 1987, Chrysler discovers
an unforeseen problem in the course of its 'due diligence'
investigation of the company," referring to American Motors.
    A Chrysler spokeswoman would not say whether some problem
had cropped up in the talks. She stuck by the company's
statement that more time was needed because the talks are
complex. "That is our definition of the delay," she said.
    Under the previous agreement between Chrysler and Renault,
their letter of intent would be terminated on April nine or
when an agreement was reached. But the letter could be amendend
by a written agreement by both companies.
    The Chrysler spokeswoman said, "We are still working toward
a definitive agreement." Said another Chrysler official who is
not part of the talks but who would be told if the deal were in
trouble: "There are no glitches."
    Analysts also downplayed the significance of the delay. "I
can't visualize where they wouldn't want it to be done," said
Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette analyst Richard Henderson.

<TITLE>GENERAL ELECTRIC &lt;GE> 1ST QTR HELPED BY RCA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FAIRFIELD, Conn., April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>General Electric Corp said its
first quarter results were significantly higher due to the
strong results of RCA, which was acquired last year.
    General Electric also attibuted continued strong
performances in plastics, major appliances and the Employers
Reinsurance Corp for its strong quarter.
    GE recorded net earnings for the first quarter 1987 of 624
mln dlrs, or 1.37 dls per shr, up 16 pct from 537 mln dlrs, or
1.18 dlrs per share for the same quarter a year ago.
    General Electric chairman John Welch Jr reiterated the
company's outlook for 1987 in which it expects double-digit GE
earnings growth for the year. He said the first quarter results
are in line with those expectations.
    General Electric cited the strong results in TV network and
station operations of the National Broadcasting Co, which was
not part of GE in the first quarter of 1986, as one reason for
its strong earnings.
    It also noted that aircraft engine operating profit was
much higher than a year ago, caused by a increase in shipments
than the 1986 quarter, which was impacted by a strike.
    Aerospace revenues were sharply higher in this year's first
quarter from a year ago, mainly because of the inclusion of
RCA's aerospace and defense business, the company said.
    In addition, consumer products revenues were up from last
year, mainly because of including sales of RCA video products.
    General Electric said restructuring provisions of 308 mln
dlrs before taxes to implement various strategic moves were
charged against operations in the first quarter of 1987. It
added that there was a one-time gain of 281 mlns dlrs after
taxes from an inventory accounting change.
    And technical products revenues and operating profit were
ahead of last year, led by a strong increases in medical
systems volume and the inclusion this year of RCA's
communications and related services.

<TITLE>TECK STILL IN TALKS ON B.C. COPPER VENTURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Teck Corp> said it
was continuing talks about joining a joint copper venture at
Highland Valley, British Columbia, held by affiliates Cominco
Ltd &lt;CLT> and &lt;Lornex Mining Corp>, but did not know when
negotiations would be completed.
    Teck vice-president of administration John Guminski said in
reply to a query that the talks had been "ongoing for a long
time." He declined to speculate on the outcome.
    Cominco, 29.5 pct owned by a consortium led by Teck, is
optimistic that the talks will soon be concluded, spokesman Don
Townson told Reuters.
    "I think all partners are hopeful that the situation will be
resolved," Cominco's Townson said.
    "We're optimistic that they will be concluded shortly," he
added. Townson declined to specify when the talks might end.
    Cominco and Teck's 22 pct-owned Lornex agreed in January
1986 to form the joint venture, merging their Highland Valley
copper operations.
    Cominco and Lornex share equally in control and management
of the Highland Valley operations, while Cominco has a 55 pct
share of production and Lornex receives 45 pct.
    For the six months following July 1, 1986, when the venture
officially started production, Highland Valley had total ore
milled of 22.6 mln short tons, grading an average of 0.41 pct
copper, Townson said.
    Cominco's share of production was 43,000 short tons of
copper contained in concentrate, 1,200 short tons of Molybdenum
in concentrate, 340,000 ounces of silver and 800 ounces of
gold, he said.
    A consortium, 50 pct owned by Teck and 25 pct each by MIM
(Canada) Inc and Metallgesellschaft Canada Ltd, acquired its
Cominco stake last year from Canadian Pacific Ltd &lt;CP>.

<DATELINE>    LOS GATOS, Calif., April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Xebec Corp said it expects to
report a loss for its second quarter ended April three, due
principally to a decline in sales to International Business
Machines Corp &lt;IBM>, the company's largest customer.
    Xebec also said it expects revenues to total about 23 mln
dlrs.
    The company reported a second quarter loss last year of 1.9
mln dlrs, or 14 cts per share, on 23.9 mln in revenues.
    Xebec said IBM has historically accounted for about 50 pct
of the company's revenues, but that total fell to 20 pct during
the quarter just ended.
    IBM had used Xebec's hard disk drive controller products in
the IBM PC/XT, a product which IBM is phasing out.
    Xebec said it intends to continue streamlining its
operations in light of the loss of business.
    The company also said it has already consolidated two of
its plants in Nevada and it now plans to sell unused and
surplus assets to provide additional liquidity.

delivered at its annual meeting in San Francisco, reiterated
its expectation of a loss in the first quarter.
    It said results would be hurt by a 25 mln dlr one-time

    In remarks prepared for delivery to shareholders, President
Peter Donis said Caterpillar's targeted five pct cost reduction
in 1987 "will be difficult to achieve because the weaker dollar
has limited opportunities to obtain lower material costs."

<TITLE>SOUTH KOREA CORN IMPORTS MAY INCREASE - USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Korea's purchase of about 2.4
mln tonnes of U.S. corn in the past six months -- close to
double last year's total -- indicates that imports from the
United States, as well as total imports are set for a dramatic
jump, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    In its World Production and Trade Report, the department
said total South Korea corn imports for the 1986/87 season
(Oct-Sept) are estimated at 4.3 mln tonnes, with about 3.4 mln
tonnes from the United States.
    During the 1985/86 season, imports totaled only 1.3 mln
tonnes of U.S. corn out of a total of 3.6 mln tonnes.
    Ite appears the Koreans are shifting back to U.S. corn in
light of competitive U.S. prices and uncertain supplies from
China, Argentina and South Africa, it said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Group of 24 developing countries
said in a communique that some kind of debt relief is necessary
and called for "a new attitude" on the part of the banks.
    The communique, released in conjunction with the semiannual
meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank,
said the very low income countries needed a cancellation of
debt to industrial countries, a conversion of part of their
debt into grants and a rescheduling on concessional terms.
    For some other countries, the communique said, the debt
cannot be properly serviced if the countries are to grow at the
same time.
    "The debt overhang effects the capacity to grow as it
reduces the ability to import," the communique said.
    It added: "Some kind of debt relief and a new attitude on
the part of the banks is necessary."
    The communique added that debtor countries and banks have
to explore new market mechanisms, debt into equity swaps,
capitalization of interest and writeoffs.

<TITLE>PERU DECREES FIRMS SHOULD BUY TREASURY BONDS </TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LIMA, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>the Peruvian government decreed that a wide
range of firms would have to earmark between 20 and 30 pct of
their 1986 net profits to buy treasury bonds this year.
    A presidential decree said that banking, financial and
insurance firms as well as bottling and tobacco industries with
1986 sales of more than 1.6 mln intis would have to earmark 30
pct of their net profits from last year to buy the bonds.
    The bonds would be redeemed over the next two years and
their interest rate would be set by the central bank. Textile,
commercial and fishing canneries with sales over 1.24 mln intis
would have to buy bonds equal to 20 pct of profits.
    The firms would have to buy the bonds between April and
December 1987.
   The decree said the government adopted the move to obtain
financing for high-priority investment projects, which it did
not specify.
    The economy ministry says it aims to keep the public
sector's budget deficit to between five and six pct of the
gross domestic product (gdp).
    Last year, the deficit was six pct of gdp, according to the
central bank.

States from Mexico must now be branded with the letter M on the
right jaw, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    In its World Production and Trade Report, the department
said the branding is necessary to improve surveillance for
bovine tuberculosis because it provides a permanent way to
identify Mexican steers.
    The requirement is not expected to affect the number of
Mexican steers imported into the United States and the brand
will be applied before the animals arrive at U.S. ports of
entry.
    Last November, the Mexican Government authorized an export
quota of nearly 1.1 mln head of live cattle for the 1986/87
season (Aug-July), most of which goes to the United States.

    The company reported a profit of 365,883 dlrs, 23 cts a

coming from non-operating factors, a spokesman said.
    Miller attributed the expected loss to completion of the

and taking more time than originally anticipated.
    Vulcan is working to resolve the problems, Miller told

seeking public comments on the question of adjusting the
Commodity Credit Corporation's (CCC) discount and premium
schedules to improve the quality of grain it accepts as loan
collateral or under price support programs.
    The premiums and discounts schedule are based on quality
factors such as moisture content and kernel damage. The
schedule stipulates the premiums and discounts used for valuing
grain the CCC accepts or purchases during the year.
    The department said it is possible that producers could be
encouraged to delivery higher quality grain to CCC by adjusting
the premiums and discounts.
    Comments are due by April 24 and a report to Congress is
required by law by May 10.

said it signed a definitive agreement to sell its spirits
division for 545 mln dlrs to James Beam Distilling Co, a unit
of American Brands Inc &lt;AMB>.
    The sale of the spirits division was made under the

month for 128 mln dlrs to Heublein Inc, part of Grand

    Proceeds from the sale will be used to repay debt and for
other corporate purposes, the company said.
    In a separate statement, American Brands said the sale
would be for 545 mln dlrs plus the assumption of liabilities.
    The sale would be subject to compliance with the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other
regulatory approvals, the company said.

580 mln dlrs, American Brands said. National's spirits brands
include Gilbey's gin and vodka, DeKuyper Liqueurs and Windsor

<TITLE>WOJNILOWER SEES DROP IN U.S. INTEREST RATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Reserve will promote lower
interest rates this year to sustain world economic growth,
First Boston Corp managing director Albert Wojnilower said.
    As much as the Fed would like to take a tough line against
inflation, it cannot act to slow the growth of credit without
subverting national U.S. economic policy.
    "On selected occasions when the dollar seems steady, and,
because the trade deficit is not responding, the United States
decided to push Germany and Japan harder to meet their
commitments to economic growth, the Federal Reserve will do its
part by moving rates down," Wojnilower said in a report.
    "Justifiably not anticipating either a recession or
seriously higher interest rates, securities market participants
have seen little to fear," Wojnilower said.
    He said last week's "hiccup" in money and currency rates
and bond and stock prices was probably caused by Japanese
window dressing for March 31 end-of-fiscal-year accounts.
    Wojnilower said the U.S. probably enjoyed above-average
economic growth in the first quarter. However, the pick-up
seems to reflect an unsustainable pace of inventory building
and the prospect for the full year is still for real gross
national product growth of about 2-1/2 pct, he said.

<TITLE>CANADA TO MONITOR STEEL IMPORTS, EXPORTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canada plans to monitor steel shipments
flowing in and out of the country in an attempt to appease
concerns in the U.S. over the high level of Canadian steel
exports, Trade Minister Pat Carney said.
    "To help maintain our open access to the U.S. steel market,
the government is taking further action to ensure we have more
accurate data on exports and imports and that Canada is not
used as a backdoor to the U.S. market by offshore suppliers,"
Carney said.
    Carney also said Canadian companies were being asked to
exercise prudence in the U.S. market and both countries were
considering establishing a joint commission to study the
growing steel problem.
    Carney told the House of Commons she will soon announce an
amendment to the Exports and Imports Permits Act to set up the
monitoring program.
    Canadian steel shipments to the U.S. have risen to 5.7 pct
cent of the U.S. market in recent months, almost double the
level just two years ago, Canadian trade officials said.
    The increase in Canadian shipments comes at a time of
growing anger in the U.S. over rising steel imports from
several countries in the face of a decline in the domestic
steel industry.
    Some U.S. lawmakers have proposed Canada's share of the
American market be limited to 2.4 pct.

<TITLE>U.S.SENATE LIFTS SOME BANS ON NATURAL GAS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Senate unanimously approved
legislation to lift a ban on new construction of natural
gas-fired power plants and other large industrial gas-burning
plants.
    The bill, sponsored by Senate Energy Committee chairman
Bennett Johnston, also repeals mandatory incremental pricing of
natural gas which was designed to protect residential consumers
from major price increases by forcing some industrial users to
pay higher than market prices.
    "This legislation will open up new natural gas markets," the
Lousiana Democrat said.
    The gas restrictions were enacted in 1978 in response to a
shortage of natural gas and predictions of higher prices.
    "Now both oil and gas prices are severely depressed,"
Johnston said.
    In a compromise with coal producers, the bill requires new
baseload electric powerplants be designed to accomodate
modifications necessary to burning coal or another alternate
fuel.

<TITLE>WILLIAMS &lt;WMB> SEES FLAT PIPELINE VOLUMES IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TULSA, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Williams Cos said it expected oil and
fertilizer transportation volumes to be flat in 1987 but said
operating profits from the pipeline unit should improve from
49.4 mln dlrs earned last year when a seven mln dlr special
charge was incurred.
    Williams Pipeline Co took the charge against earnings in
1986 for the removal of more than 500 miles of old pipeline
from service and for casualty losses. Companywide, Williams had
a net loss of 134 mln dlrs on total revenues of 1.85 billion
dlrs, a decline from profits of 32 mln dlrs on sales of 2.46
billion in 1985.
    In its annual report, Williams said its Northwest Pipeline
Corp and Williams Natural Gas Co had natural gas costs that are
among the lowest in the nation, averaging 2.04 dlrs and 2.07
dlrs per mcf, respectively, last year. Total natural gas
reserves for both units declined to 10,010 billion cubic feet
in 1986 from 11,334 billion cubic feet the previous year.
    The company said its Williams Natural Gas unit, which has
less take-or-pay exposure than most major pipelines, should
show improvement in its 1987 operating results because of
changes tariff and federal tax rates.
    The company's gas marketing business is expected to have
somewhat lower earnings in 1987 because of competition in its
operating region, the annual report said. The gas marketing
unit earned 26.0 mln dlrs on sales of 285.6 mln dlrs last year.
    Williams also said it expected a substantial decline in its
debt to equity ratio this year because of more than 250 mln
dlrs received in cash from the sale of Agrico Chemical Co and
proceeds from the sale and leaseback of Williams
Telecommunications Co. The telecommunications business, a
2,000-mile fiber optic system for long distance use, will not
be profitable until late 1988, Williams said.

    The statement said that there should be a new attitude and
approach in respect of the existing stock of debt and called
for current flows and future credits to be examined by
governments, multilateral and banking institutions.
    The statement also said that the prospects of the least

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poor's Corp said it is
keeping 230 mln dlrs of debt of Caesars World Inc and Caesars
World Finance Corp on creditwatch with negative implications.
    S and P cited Caesars World's proposed recapitalization
plan that calls for incurring one billion dlrs of bank and
other debt to finance a 25 dlr per share special dividend and
the repayment of about 222.5 mln dlrs of existing debt.
    It said the plan's terms would violate dividend convenants
in the rated debt's indentures and likely force refinancing of
those issues. Caesars was placed on creditwatch for a possible
downgrade March nine following investor Martin Sosnoff's bid.
    Sosnoff bid 28 dlrs per share, or 725.2 mln dlrs, for the
86.4 pct of Caesars World stock he does not already own,
Standard and Poor's noted.
    The rating agency said an increase in Sosnoff's offer is
possible. If successful, the stock bid would markedly raise
Caesars World's financial risk and lead to a large drop in net
income and cash flow, S and P said.
    Caesars World currently carries BB senior debt and B-plus
subordinated debt. The finance unit's subordinated debt, which
is guaranteed by the parent, is rated B-plus.

<DATELINE>    ATLANTA, Ga., April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>HBO and Co said it sent a letter of
strongly urging shareholders not to sign any proxy cards sent
by Andover Group.
    ON March 30, Andover Group, a two-man general partnership
which owns about seven pct of HBO's stock, filed preliminary
proxy materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission
seeking to nominate an alternative slate of directors at the
company's April 30 annual meeting.
    Andover had expressed an interest to acquire the company in
September 1986 but HBO has never received an offer from them,
it said.
    In addition, HBO said its financial condition is improving
rapidly as the result of a significant restructuring
implemented in 1986.
    It expects the company to report net income of about 40 cts
per share in 1987 and a very significant increase in 1988.
    For the year ended December 1986, the company reported a
loss of 3.6 mln dlrs, or 16 cts per share.

<TITLE>HAWKEYE &lt;HWKB> 1986 ANNUAL REPORT QUALIFIED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DES MOINES, IOWA, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hawkeye Bancorp's 1986 annual
financial results were qualified by its auditors, according to
the annual report.
    "...there are conditions which may indicate that the
company will be unable to continue as a going concern,"
auditors Deloitte Haskins and Sells said in Hawkeye's annual
report to shareholders.
    Hawkeye reported a 1986 loss of almost 59 mln dlrs, citing
an increase in its loan loss provision to 34.7 mln dlrs and
restructuring costs of 27 mln dlrs.
    However, Hawkeye, with assets of 1.09 billion dlrs at 1986
year end, said it expects "to have sufficient cash to meet its
obligations for the next 12-month period."
    Last July the bank holding company reached a debt
restructuring agreement which identifed 17 bank subsidiaries
and five non-bank operations for disposition.
    "The restructuring has improved Hawkeye's financial
condition, but it does not assure that Hawkeye will be able to
survive as a going concern," the report said.
    Hawkeye's survival will depend on its ability to comply
with provisions of the debt restructuring and regulatory
agreements and on its ability to return to profitable
operations, it said.
    There can be no assurance that Hawkeye will be able to meet
these requirements. However, the company "believes it will be
able to do so," Hawkeye said.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poor's Corp said that
corporate credit quality stabilized in the first quarter of the
year, even though downgrades outpaced upgrades.
    S and P said it reduced 79 debt ratings, affecting 63
billion dlrs of debt securities, and raised 28 ratings,
affecting 12 billion dlrs of debt.
    However, the rating agency pointed out that last quarter's
number of downgrades was the lowest since first quarter 1986.
It also said the upgrades were the fewest since early 1986.
    It said rating changes quieted in the oil and insurance
sectors, while utilities provided a positive influence.
    Standard and Poor's said its major downgrades last quarter
were of Denmark, USX Corp &lt;X>, Chase Manhattan Corp &lt;CMB> and
Manufacturers Hanover Corp &lt;MHC>.
    It said the most negative influence on rating changes
occurred in the financial institution sector, where there were
22 downgrades versus five upgrades.
    Notably, ratings were reduced for several of the largest
U.S. bank holding companies, reflecting lower asset quality and
weaknesses that were specific to those firms, S/P said.
    Among industrials, S and P cut 43 ratings and raised 10.
Lower ratings prevailed in steel and health care, it said.

<TITLE>DOME &lt;DMP> PLAN MAY FORCE SALE OF ENCOR STAKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dome Petroleum Ltd's proposal to
restructure debt of more than 6.10 billion Canadian dlrs
includes provisions that may force the company to sell its 42
pct stake in &lt;Encor Energy Corp Inc>, Dome said in a U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
    Dome said in the filing that its debt plan proposes making
payments under a five year income debenture to the lender whose
debt is secured by Dome's Encor shares.
    After the five years are up, "under certain circumstances
the shares of Encor may be required to be disposed," the company
said.
    Dome has pledged its 42.5 mln Encor shares as security for
part of its debt to &lt;Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce>,
estimated last year at 947 mln dlrs.
    Analysts have said Commerce Bank was pressing Dome to sell
the stock to pay down its debt.
    Dome's Encor shares had a market value of 313 mln dlrs on
March 17, 1987, the company's filing said.
    As previously reported, Dome is seeking approval in
principle for the debt restructuring plan. Dome said in the
filing it proposed lenders sign a letter of understanding in
early April, with implementation to be effective July 1, 1987.
    Dome Petroleum reiterated in the SEC filing that its
existence as a going concern is dependent on continuing the
interim debt plan, due to expire on June 30, and winning
agreement for its proposed restructuring plan.
    "The company believes that the negotiation and
implementation of the proposed debt restructuring plan is
realistic and achievable," Dome said.
    "However, the final outcome of the negotiations cannot be
predicted at this time," it said.

<TITLE>DEFICIT CUTS SEEN UNABLE TO CURE TRADE DEFICIT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Irwin Arieff</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Financial analysts say they are
pleased with congressional moves to trim next year's federal
budget deficit but believe the actions will do little to help
improve the U.S. trade deficit or buoy the economy.
    The House of Representatives is expected to vote tomorrow
to approve a trillion-dollar budget blueprint for the coming
fiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs.
    Similarly, the Senate Budget Committee has approved a plan
that would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs next
year.
        "In terms of the economy, 37-38 billion dlrs is
infinitesimal, so cuts of this magnitude will have little
impact on the economy and the trade deficit," said Stanley
Collander, a Touche Ross federal budget policy analyst.
    "At best, it will have a small positive effect," Collander
said in an interview.
    Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker has repeatedly
told Congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long way
to help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help ease
some of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar.
    The U.S. government has attempted to remedy the trade
imbalance by driving down the value of the dollar. But Volcker
has warned that a further fall in the dollar's value is fraught
with danger.
    Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation as
imported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign
capital needed to finance the federal budget deficit.
    In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with other
major industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value of
the dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates
should be stabilized at around current levels.
    As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed to
take steps to stimulate their economies and the United States
agreed to cut its budget deficit.
    The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a
way to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, is
to reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending.
    "If you don't deal with the budget deficit, everything else
you do is going to be counterproductive," Volcker said in recent
testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.
    Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the
government's purse strings than have the Fed tighten the credit
supply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or
to assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the United
States.
    Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off the
current modest economic expansion and threaten a recession.
    Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressed
that any deficit reduction was better than none.
    But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were 
not enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility it
needs to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar
from plunging further in world exchange markets.
    "There's no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but if
your objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the
Fed's flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answer
is, it's not enough," Silvia told Reuters.
    The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government's
most vexing and persistent problems.
    The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yet
little indication that this year's figure will be any lower,
though administration officials have predicted it will drop by
about 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year's end.
    In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleep
worrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from the
federal budget.
    On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is not
attached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for
the 1986-1991 period by last year's Gramm-Rudman balanced
budget law.
    While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for
next year's federal deficit, both the House and Senate Budget
Committees have conceded that their budget plans would fall
short of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs.
    "For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the
most you're going to get" out of Congress at the present time,
said Touche Ross's Collander. "To do something more than that
would be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult."
    Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end up
short of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels.
    "To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptable
reduction level," he explained. "Anything less than that will now
look like a failure to Wall Street."
    The budget plan now under debate on the House floor would
lower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year
beginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting
defense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their
anticipated spending levels for next year.
    The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit of
nearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in new 
taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts.

<TITLE>COLOMBIA COFFEE REGISTRATIONS REMAIN OPEN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOGOTA, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Colombia's coffee export registrations
remain open and there are no plans to close them since a new
marketing policy means an unlimited amount can be registered,
Gilberto Arango, president of the private exporters'
association said.
    "The philosophy of the new policy is not to close
registrations. Nobody so far said may would be closed," he told
Reuters.
    On March 13, Colombia opened registrations for April and
May for an unlimited amount.
    Without giving breakdowns, Arango said private exporters
had registered 1,322,804 bags this calendar year up to April 6,
or roughly 440,000 bags per month, slightly lower than the
average in recent years.
    He estimated the amount of bags registered by the national
coffee growers' federation at about the same, meaning a total
of about 900,000 bags registered and sold per month by
Colombia.
    "The only change that could happen is, because of the
volume, we would be told that from such a date, registrations
would be for June shipment, etc" Arango said.

<TITLE>FUNARO SAYS BRAZIL'S CREDITORS MUST TRUST HIM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson
Funaro, who suspended interest payments to creditor banks two
months ago, said creditors had to trust him when he said Brazil
would achieve a trade surplus large enough to continue
servicing its debt.
    Speaking to reporters at the Brazilian Embassy, Funaro said
he would not seek approval of Brazil's economic program outside
his country, but added, "At the same time we show credibility,
you (the banks) are going to have to trust us."
    Asked if creditor banks would accept Brazil's refinancing
needs based on a new economic program not endorsed by the
International Monetary Fund, Funaro said, "What other options do
they have?...They have to try to see our program."
    Funaro, who is in Washington to attend the Interim
Committee and Development Committee meetings of the World Bank
and IMF, said he unveiled his refinancing proposals to the
major creditor banks in New York yesterday.
    According to Funaro, the creditor banks "agreed on the need
to find a solution to the crisis." He did not elaborate.
    Funaro said the commercial banks agreed on Brazil's need
for economic growth and added that creditors were aware that
Brazil cannot continue to export the 24 billion dlrs in net
capital that it transferred over the past three years.
    He also said that he told bankers about Brazil's needs to
ensure a seven pct average growth and eight billion to 11
billion dlr trade surplus until 1991.
    Administration officials familiar with the negotiations
said Brazil's new economic measures did not make much sense
based on current conditions in that country, and added that
they saw long and difficult negotiations ahead.
    Lewis Preston, chairman of J.P. Morgan and Co. Inc., told
Reuters he remains hopeful that Brazil and its foreign bank
creditors will reach a debt rescheduling agreement before the
end of the year.
    But Preston, who did not attend the meeting between Funaro
and creditor banks yesterday, added the onus is still on Brazil
to put its economic house in order first.
    "They haven't even come up with a plan yet," Preston said
after Morgan's annual meeting in New York today.
    Funaro, however, said most creditor banks had
representatives in Brazil who were well aware of Brazil's new
economic measures, designed to curb a surge in inflation and
spending and a sharp drop in exports.
    Funaro called Brazil's program very responsible and very
strong, adding that "it is very different from other years,
there has been a tremendous change."
    Based on Brazil's current economic situation - suspension
of interest payments on 67 billion dlrs owed to banks, 200 pct
inflation and the need of four billion dlrs in new loans every
year until 1991 - he said he was faced with two options.

<TITLE>MORE AMERICAN BRANDS &lt;AMB> ACQUISITIONS SEEN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By PATTI DOMM, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>American Brands Inc's 545 mln dlrs
acquisition of National Distillers and Chemical Corp's liquor
business is expected to be one of a series of acquisitions by
the tobacco company, analysts said.
     "They were very frustrated with their inability to get
Chesebrough. They said they were looking for an acquisition. It
doesn't surprise me that they came up with another one," said
Allan Kaplan of Merrill Lynch and Co.
    American Brands failed late last year in its 2.9 billion
dlrs bid for Chesebrough-Ponds Inc when Unilever N.V. agreed to
buy the company. But since then, Wall Street has been
speculating that American Brands would find another candidate
to help reduce its earnings exposure to tobacco.
    "This is just typical," said George Thompson of
Prudential-Bache securities. "There's going to be more to come
here. American Brands had to make an acquisition because
tobacco is still a significant part of earnings. Their position
is a little less favorable than Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds,"
he said.
cash flow from its low growth tobacco, but the tobacco business
does require great amounts of capital expenditures. It can
therefore use its funds to make acquisitions. Analysts said the
National Distillers' spirits company, which makes Gilbey's gin
and vodka, Old Grandad and Old Crow whiskey, is not quite the
type of acquisition they envisioned.
    "The distilled spirits business has been in a steady
gradual decline for sometime, as has the tobacco business,"
said Thompson.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>BUNDESBANK CALLS FOR CENTRAL BANK COOPERATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler
called on central banks of major industrialised nations to
cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies.
    In a lecture at the University of Surrey, pre-released
here, Koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was
protectionism and control on capital movements.
    "Central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market
transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have
them," he said. He added that West German growth forecasts would
have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop
to 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987.
    Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets
had parted company with transactions in goods, services and
investments. It was the scale of speculative transactions that
determined market trends.
    Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to
grow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rates
would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off.
    "In other words, the monetary policy measures required are
different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --
those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of
mounting economic activity," Koehler said.
    The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S.
Current account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciation
going by talking the dollar down posed problems.
    The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep
rise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the cost
of European imports. But the volume effect of falling imports
to the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time to
make itself felt compared with the price effect.
    "Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going
further than would be necessary to adjust the current account
over the medium term," Koehler said.
    A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occur
only if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand.
In Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand should
rise faster than GNP.
    "In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986," Koehler said.
    If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be
prevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset by
an inflow of foreign funds into the U.S..
    But only if there was an appropriate interest rate
differential would Europe and Japan look for financial
investment in the U.S.
    When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bank
had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its
measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions.
    Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates
by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading
interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market
and its substantial impact on exchange rates.
    It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of
price stability, economic growth and full employment but also
to tackle international problems like the exchange rate
problem, the debt problem and the current account problem.
    A strategy had to be designed that helped "the safeguarding
of non-inflationary economic growth in an international
monetary system largely free of disruptions," Koehler said.
    Given the system of floating exchange rates, it was
necessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficed
to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over
the next few years and intervention points should not be set,
because they were only testing points for the market, he said.
    In order to keep the international monetary system free of
disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but
also cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said.

<TITLE>JAPAN MINISTRY HAS NO COMMENT ON RICE TALKS REPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Agriculture Ministry declined comment
on a local newspaper report that Japan had agreed to hold talks
on its closed rice market in the new GATT round.
    "We have no idea about the report and cannot comment," a
spokesman told Reuters.
    Nihon Keizai Shinbun, quoting unnamed government sources,
said Japan would tell U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter of its
intentions. The two are due to visit Japan later this month for
farm talks.
    The U.S. Has been pressing Japan to discuss the rice issue
at the new round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
talks. But Japan has said GATT is not the right forum.
    Imports of rice to Japan are banned under the Foodstuff
Control Act.
    Nihon Keizai said Japan's plan resulted from worries about
mounting trade tension with the U.S. At the GATT talks, Japan
will try to persuade the U.S. That its rice policy is
justified, it said.
    The 93-nation world trade body began the Uruguay trade
round last September. It will take four years to negotiate.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - TELECOM IS KEY JAPAN MINISTRY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Linda Sieg, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's little-known Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications (MPT) has emerged as an international force
to be reckoned with, political analysts said.
    MPT, thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the U.S.
And Britain, is in a position of strength due to its control of
a lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians,
they said.
    "The ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control of
a key industrial sector, telecommunications and information,"
said one diplomatic source.
    "They are a potent political force," the diplomatic source
said.
    But MPT is finding domestic political prowess does not
always help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy, analysts
said.
    "The ministry was a minor ministry and its people were not
so internationalized," said Waseda University professor Mitsuru
Uchida. "Suddenly they're standing at the centre of the world
community and in that sense, they're at a loss (as to) how to
face the situation."
    Most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row with
London over efforts by Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc to keep
a major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete in
Japan's lucrative overseas telephone business.
    The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rival
groups, arguing the market cannot support more than one
competitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which now
monopolizes the business.
    It has also opposed a major management role in the planned
merger for any non-Japanese overseas telecommunications firm on
the grounds that no such international precedent exists.
    The ministry's stance has outraged both London, which has
threatened to retaliate, and Washington, which says the merger
plan is evidence of Japan's failure to honour pledges to open
its telecommunications market.
    Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which it
says have limited access for U.S. Firms to Japan's car
telephone and satellite communications market.
    Much of MPT's new prominence stems from the growth of the
sector it regulates.
    "What has been happening is an important shift in the
economy which makes the ministry a very important place," said
James Abegglen, head of the consulting firm Asia Advisory
Service Inc.
    A decision to open the telecommunications industry to
competition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boosted
rather than lessened MPT's authority, analysts said.
    "With the legal framework eased, they became the de facto
legal framework," said Bache Securities (Japan) analyst Darrell
Whitten.
    Close links with the powerful political faction of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) nurtured by former Prime
Minister Kakuei Tanaka are another key to MPT's influence, the
analysts said.
    "Other factions ignored MPT (in the 1970s), but the Tanaka
faction was forward looking and ... Recognized the importance
of MPT," Uchida said. Many former bureaucrats became members of
the influential political group, he added.
    The ministry also has power in the financial sector due to
the more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in the
Postal Savings System, analysts said.
    MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulate
interest rates on small deposits, a key element in financial
liberalisation, since the change would remove the Postal
Savings System's ability to offer slightly higher rates than
banks, they said.
    Diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as MPT's
obstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterized
the ministry as feudal.
    Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limiting
competition and sheltering the former monopolies under its
wing. Providing consumers with the best service at the lowest
price takes a back seat to such considerations, they said.
    But many of the ministry's actions are not unlike those of
its bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western world
including Britain, several analysts said.
    "The United States is really the odd man out," Abegglen said.
"For a government to take the view that it wants to keep order
in utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonable
view," he said.

<TITLE>G-7 ISSUES STATEMENT AFTER MEETING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Following is the text of a statement
by the Group of Seven -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France,
Britain, Italy and Canada -- issued after a Washington meeting
yesterday.
    1. The finance ministers and central bank governors of
seven major industrial countries met today.
    They continued the process of multilateral surveillance of
their economies pursuant to the arrangements for strengthened
economic policy coordination agreed at the 1986 Tokyo summit of
their heads of state or government.
    The managing director of the International Monetary Fund
also participated in the meeting.
    2. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to
the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting,
and noted the progress achieved in implementing the
undertakings embodied in the Louvre Agreement.
    They agreed, however, that further actions will be
essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain
global economic expansion, and reduce trade imbalances.
    In this connection they welcomed the proposals just
announced by the governing Liberal Democratic Party in Japan
for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate Japan's
economy through early implementation of a large supplementary
budget exceeding those of previous years, as well as
unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.
    The government of Japan reaffirmed its intention to further
open up its domestic markets to foreign goods and services.
    3. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that
around current levels their currencies are within ranges
broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic
policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.
    In that connection they welcomed the strong implementation
of the Louvre Agreement.
    They concluded that present and prospective progress in
implementing the policy undertakings at the Louvre and in this
statement provided a basis for continuing close cooperation to
foster the stability of exchange rates.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>GERMAN BANKERS' REMARKS REVIVE TALK OF RATE CUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Remarks by two leading central bankers
sparked renewed speculation in financial markets that a cut in
the West German three pct discount rate may be under
discussion, currency dealers said.
    Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler said in a speech that
monetary growth resulting from speculative capital inflows
required cuts in interest rates.
    Separately, West Berlin state central bank president Dieter
Hiss told journalists that the discount rate could fall below
its lowest ever point of 2.75 pct. He made clear that he was
not making a forecast on interest rates, however.
    Currency dealers here and in the Far East said the dollar
gained slight background support from the speculation.
    But German dealers noted that the Bundesbank kept the 3.80
pct rate unchanged at which it offered liquidity to the money
market this week, dashing some expectations that it may either
offer lower fixed rate money or offer a reduced minimum rate
and let the strength of banks' demands set the allocation rate.
    It allocated 6.1 billion marks in new liquidity, much less
than the 14.9 billion leaving the market as a prior pact
expired. This further weakened sentiment the Bundesbank could
move to a more accommodative monetary stance, dealers said.
    Koehler said in a speech in Surrey, England, speculative
capital inflows may cause monetary growth, regardless of
whether central banks intervened or exchange rates fell.
    "In other words, the monetary policy measures required are
different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --
those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of
mounting economic activity."
    Though Koehler was known to be the most liberal of the
generally monetarist Bundesbank board, his comments marked the
first time cuts in rates had been concretely suggested as a
counterpoint to overly strong monetary growth, dealers said.

<TITLE>SOVIET TRADE DEFICIT WITH WEST SOARS IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MOSCOW, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Soviet trade deficit with the West
almost quadrupled last year, reaching 2.72 billion roubles
compared with 713 mln in 1985, official figures showed.
    Statistics published by the monthly journal Foreign Trade
showed Soviet trade turnover for 1986 fell to 130.9 billion
roubles from 142.1 billion the previous year, a drop of 7.8
pct.
    Moscow's trade surplus with East Bloc countries continued
to grow in 1986.
    Western analysts attributed the deficit rise with the West
to the world oil price slump, which hit Moscow's main export
and cut hard currency earnings needed for purchases in the
West.

<TITLE>RTZ SEES RISING U.S. OUTPUT AIDING 1987 RESULTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Rio Tinto-Zinc Corp Plc &lt;RTZL.L>, RTZ,
said the predicted rise in industrial production in the U.S.
And Europe should boost its 1987 performance.
    Consumption of some base metals and their dlr prices are
showing signs of improvement, although iron ore markets have
weakened. The oil price in U.S. Dlrs is above the 1986 average,
and if sustained, should improve energy earnings.
    The company was commenting in a statement on its 1986
results which, on a restated basis, showed net attributable
profits lower at 245 mln stg after 257 mln the previous year.
Pretax profits also dipped to 601.7 mln stg after 614.4 mln.
    RTZ said the excellent performance of its expanding range
of industrial businesses in 1986 was offset by the collapse in
oil prices.
    Industrial businesses contributed 202 mln stg to net
profit, a 40 pct increase from 144 mln in 1985, and 60 pct of
the total. Trading performance improved at wholly-owned
subsidiaries RTZ Borax Ltd, RTZ Cement Ltd, RTZ Chemicals Ltd
and RTZ Pillar Ltd. First time contributions from recent
investment and acquisitions mainly in speciality chemicals and
minerals also aided performance.
    Metals activities contributed 83 mln stg to net profit.

<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The maximum export rebate granted at
yesterday's EC sugar tender marked no change in policy over
producer complaints that they are not obtaining the EC
intervention price in exporting sugar outside the Community, EC
Commission sources said.
    The maximum rebate was 46.496 Ecus per 100 kilos for
118,350 tonnes of sugar, down from 46.864 Ecus the previous
week, but the change is explained by world market conditions.
    Producers claim the rebate was short of the level needed to
obtain a price equivalent to the intervention price by over one
Ecu per 100 kilos, and was 0.87 Ecu short the previous week,
the sources said.
    They said this was despite the fact that the Commission had
to accept 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention from
operators protesting that rebates are too low.
    Operators have now until early May to withdraw this sugar.
But they have not given any sign of planned withdrawals unless
the Commission reviews its export policy, they said.

<TITLE>JAPAN BUSINESS LEADERS SAY G-7 ACCORD IS WORRYING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The leaders of two of Japan's top business
groups said in separate statements the Group of Seven (G-7)
accord reached in Washington yesterday is of deep concern to
Japan because it shows the major industrial nations regard the
yen's current level as appropriate.
    Eishiro Saito, chairman of the Federation of Economic
Organizations (Keidanren), said the yen's present rate is well
above adequate levels. He did not elaborate.
    Takashi Ishihara, chairman of the Japan Committee for
Economic Development, said the accord will not prevent the yen
from rising further.
    "We do not understand why the G-7 approved present rates as
the yen has risen excessively since the Paris accord," Ishihara
said.
    G-7 members Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the U.S.
And West Germany said in a statement they consider their
currencies are now within ranges broadly consistent with
economic fundamentals.
    Saito called on each G-7 member nation to prepare to
intervene in the market strongly enough to ensure exchange
rates are stabilised at appropriate levels.

<TITLE>PHILIPPINE TELEPHONE FIRM PLANS STOCK SPLIT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Chaitanya Kalbag, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co
&lt;PLDT.MN> is planning a two-for-one stock split and a 20 pct
stock dividend later this year to reduce excess market
buoyancy, Vice-President Sennen Lazo told Reuters.
    Lazo said the stock split would reduce the par value of the
company's common stock from 10 to five pesos.
    He said the stock split would apply to holders of about 18
mln common shares of stock on the record date of September 15
1987. "The exercise should make our stock more marketable," Lazo
said. "Now it is beyond the reach of many small investors."
    PLDT common stock surged from a low of 37 pesos in February
1986 to 367.50 at close of trading yesterday on the Manila
Stock Exchange.
    Lazo said the 20 pct stock dividend, payable on October 15,
would also apply to stockholders on record as of September 15.
    PLDT reported 1986 net income of 1.89 billion pesos, up 68
pct from 778.9 mln pesos in 1985, on operating revenues of six
billion pesos, up from 4.7 billion pesos in 1985.
    At end December 1986 the company had 417,100 stockholders.
    A PLDT spokesman said the company's profits are likely to
be substantial since the government raised its franchise tax to
three pct from two and to impose a 35 pct corporate income tax
from which it was previously exempt.
    The government has not so far ordered the implementation of
the tax decision.
    PLDT is the largest of 58 telephone companies in the
Philippines. On December 31 1986 the company had 856,014
telephones in operation, representing 94 pct of all instruments
in the country.
    In Manila item "Philippine Telephone firm plans stock split"
please read in page 3, first para, "the company's profits are
likely to be substantially cut" (inserting dropped word). This
replaces  "the company's profits are likely to be substantial"

<DATELINE>    KUALA LUMPUR, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Malaysia has asked Japan for a 42
billion yen 25-year loan to finance the construction of gas
pipelines from eastern Trengganu to southern Johor, the
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) said.
    OECF's chief representative, Takashi Matsuya, told
reporters the Japanese Government is appraising the loan.
Another OECF official told Reuters Japan is likely to approve
the loan because "it is technically and economically viable."
    If approved, the loan would carry a coupon rate of four
pct, a grace period of seven years, Matsuya said. It would be
disbursed over three years, he added.
    The pipeline contruction is the second phase of the
Peninsular Gas Utilisation Project by Petronas, Malaysia's
national oil company.
    The first phase was the supply of gas to households in and
around the eastern oil town of Kertih.

<TITLE>CCF REPORTS 34.8 PCT PROFIT BOOST, SHARE SPLIT SEEN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Credit Commercial de France &lt;CCFP.PA>
reported a parent company net profit up 34.8 pct to 140.1 mln
francs from 103.9 mln francs a few weeks before its
denationalisation around the end of this month.
    Official sources said the bank, France's sixth largest in
terms of its deposits and seventh in terms of its assets,

planned a share split to increase the number of shares on offer
ahead of the sale of 40 pct of its ordinary share capital to
the public, of 10 pct to staff and 20 pct abroad.
    Previously one of France's biggest private banks, it was
nationalised by the Socialists in 1982.
    The sources said it was too early to give details of the
planned split or of the share price, but cited April 27 as a
likely date for the flotation launch.
    So far 30 pct of the group's capital, currently at 10.33
mln shares of 100 francs nominal, has been offered for sale to
large private investors to constitute a solid core of eight to
ten shareholders before the flotation.
    The private tender offer closes on April 16, while a 12 mln
franc advertising campaign for the flotation begins on Sunday.
"The privatisation will be a way of attracting extra clients,"
CCF deputy director-general Rene de la Serre told Reuters.
    Market sources put the total value of CCF's privatisation
at between four and five billion francs.
    De la Serre said the bank was likely to attract at least

<DATELINE>    COLOMBO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The International Development
Association (IDA) is lending 18.6 mln dlrs to Sri Lanka for
agricultural research and development, the World Bank said in a
statement.
    The loan is part of a 26.5 mln dlr project to improve
production of commodities, mainly rice, and raise farmer
incomes. Other financing for the project will come from Sri
Lanka (7.1 mln dlrs) and West Germany (800,000 dlrs).
    The IDA credit is interest-free and for 50 years. It
includes a 10-year grace period but has annual charges of 0.5
pct on the undisbursed balance, and 0.75 pct on the disbursed
balance, the Bank statement said.
    The project envisages the creation of a Council of
Agricultural Research to formulate a national agricultural
strategy and introduce a contract research programme to finance
research activities, the Bank said.
    The Washington-based IDA is the World Bank's affiliate for
concessionary lending.

<DATELINE>c    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Lex Service Plc &lt;LEXL.L> said it had
acquired &lt;Sears Motor Group Ltd>, the retail motor distribution
arm of Sears Plc &lt; SEHL.L>, and an 11.9 mln stg loan note
payable by Sears Motor for 33.4 mln stg.
    The purchase will be through 1.4 mln stg in cash and the
issue to Sears Plc of 8.0 mln new Lex ordinary shares.
    The company said in a statement that immediately following
the acquisition of the motor group, its car and commercial
vehicle contract hire fleet of some 3,000 vehicles was sold to
&lt;Lex Vehicle Leasing Ltd> for 14.3 mln stg in cash, a sum equal
to the net book value of the vehicles transferred.
    Lex Vehicle is owned equally by Lex Services and &lt;Lombard
North Central Plc>.
    Lex said the shares involved in the transaction were today
being placed for Sears Plc with institutions at 400p. These
shares will not qualify for the final Lex dividend on 10 April.
    Lex said in a statement that its acquisition of Sears Motor
Group represents a major development for its automotive
activities. The enlarged retailing operations of the Lex
Automotive group now have a turnover of 530 mln stg. Lex's
existing automotive interests include Volvo Concessionaires,
the sole importer of Volvo cars and parts into the U.K.
    Lex said the turnover for Sears Motor Group in the year to
31 December 1986 was 242 mln stg and that at the date of the
acquisition the group had about 50 mln stg in external
borrowings.
    Lex shares fell on the announcement to trade around 409p
from a 419p close yesterday.

<TITLE>MAJOR RUBBER PRODUCERS TO MEET IN SINGAPORE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SINGAPORE, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Officials from Indonesia, Malaysia,
Singapore and, perhaps, Thailand will meet here tomorrow to
discuss increased regional cooperation on rubber marketing and
ways to raise rubber prices, industry sources said.
    The officials will discuss linking rubber markets in the
four countries to improve price transparency, the sources said.
    This is the first time Indonesia is attending such a
meeting, they said, but representatives from Thailand may not
be able to attend because of their tight schedule. Malaysia,
Indonesia and Thailand account for 90 pct of world rubber
exports and Singapore is a major regional rubber trading
centre.
    The Malaysian Rubber Futures market, freighting and
contracts for rubber are among other issues expected to be
discussed.
    Last month, rubber importing and exporting countries
adopted a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in Geneva.
The new pact is more responsive to market trends than its
predecessor, the sources said, and earlier provisions allowing
the buffer stock to borrow from banks have been eliminated.

    As of 1 April the valuation used under the formula had

of dollars at around 145.10 yen just after the market here
opened, dealers said.
    Just before the opening, the dollar dropped swiftly as
speculators concluded the Group of Seven (G-7) comminuique
issued in Washington contained nothing basically new, they
said. It fell about a half yen, to around 145.
    The G-7 reaffirmed that their currencies around current
levels reflect economic fundamentals.
    One dealer said the Bank of Japan probably intervened in
Australia before the opening here, but could not confirm this.

<DATELINE>    THE HAGUE, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Netherlands' largest insurer
Nationale Nederlanden NV &lt;NTTN.AS> (NatNed) said it expected at
least unchanged results in 1987 after reporting 1986 net
profits up 5.3 pct to 635.5 mln guilders from 603.4 mln in
1985,
    Revenues increased by 0.5 pct to 17.35 billion guilders

raised to 2.50 guilders per share from 2.38 guilders in 1985,
corrected on a capital increase.
    The company said guilder revenue and profit were pressured
by falls in exchange rates, particularly in the US and
Australian dollar and sterling.
    Without these currency fluctuations, net profit would have
been 30.7 mln guilders higher and revenue 1.97 billion higher,
NatNed said.
    The international share in turnover was 50 pct in 1986
compared with 52 pct in 1985.
    The company's life insurance result fell to 365.7 mln
guilders after 428.4 mln in 1985 due to currency influences,
tighter interest margins and increased investment.
    Claim payouts fell to 9.9 mln guilders after 66.6 mln the
previous year.
    The company's total assets reached 69.87 billion guilders
in 1986 against 67 billion the year before.
    Assets per share equalled 65.68 guilders against 65.53.

<TITLE>EUROPEAN MARKETS REACT QUIETLY TO G-7 COMMUNIQUE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Richard Murphy, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>European currency markets reacted quietly
to the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers
ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to
surprise that the markets should have expected so much.
    The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies
and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which
reaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency
stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.
    Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remaining
broadly entrenched in its current trading range.
    "The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84
marks," said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase Bank
AG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs.
    However, she said the dollar could break out of the range
with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.
Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.
    Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd
in Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against
the mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,
possibly to 140 yen.
    A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects
a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.
    London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb
underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative
sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank
operators to test the downside.
    Concern that finance ministers and officials still in
Washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of
currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with
worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the
near term, the traders said.
    Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the
communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's
downward trend.
    Traders in several centres said the market would look for
fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to
defend current ranges, which the communique said were "broadly
consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy
intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting."
    Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said
"They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon." The
U.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.
    However, some dealers said London-based operators would be
unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long
Easter weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825
marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.
    Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said
the G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable
market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme
volatility seen in the first few months of this year.
    One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the
communique made clear the leading nations did not want a
further dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.
    The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to
1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre
accord's supposed currency target range.
    A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were
ready for a period of "mainly sideways movement."
    But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique
contributing to greater stability.
    "Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big
boost," said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he
expects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks
in the next three months.
    A Swiss monetary source, who asked not to be named, said
the communique had been in line with realistic expectations and
should not have produced disappointment.
    "The problem is that the changes needed in fiscal and trade
policies to redress current imbalances are of a different
timescale than currency markets operate on," the source told
Reuters, "This is a political process which takes time."
    Alois Schwietert, chief economist at Swiss Bank Corp in
Basle, also questioned the tone of disappointment evident on
currency markets today. "Did people really expect a patent
remedy?" he asked.
    Bank economists in Paris noted yesterday's meeting was only
the first in a series and said the market would watch carefully
in the next few weeks for any changes in positions.
    A senior economist with Banque Indosuez said the focus was
now on trade and growth rather than interest rates. Any move by
Japan and West Germany to boost their economic growth could
lead to a quick change in the U.S. Position.
    Dealers in all centres agreed that markets would be wary in
pushing the dollar too far too quickly in the coming months
while central banks appear resolved to use their muscle to
support the Paris accord.

<TITLE>GERMAN MONEY MARKET SPLIT ON LOWER RATE PROSPECTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Remarks by central bankers raised some
hopes the Bundesbank will cut rates on securities repurchase
pacts, but operators remained divided on the likelihood of a
move in the near term, money market dealers said.
    Comments by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler yesterday
that rate cuts were needed to curb money supply growth from
speculative capital inflows, and by West Berlin state central
bank president Dieter Hiss that there was no natural lower
limit to the discount rate had, however, no immediate impact.
    Call money declined to 3.65/75 pct from 3.75/85 pct but the
drop was tied to extra liquidity in the market, dealers said.
    Dealers said the Bundesbank's latest liquidity allotment
this week dashed some hopes of lower rates.
    The Bundesbank allotted only 6.1 billion marks yesterday in
new liquidity in a repurchase pact at an unchanged rate of 3.80
pct, thus subtracting some 8.8 billion marks from the market,
as an outgoing 14.9 billion pact expired.
    But some dealers said the smaller volume awarded by the
pact was in line with present liquid money market conditions,
and did not exlude a cut in the repurchase pact rate soon to
3.70 pct if money market rates continue at present levels.
    The next opportunity for the Bundesbank to lower rates on
repurchase pacts will be in a tender expected next Tuesday.
    Bundesbank officials have already said they favour more
discreet rate adjustments through repurchase pacts, rather than
the more public adjustment of leading rates.
    The Bundesbank may either set a fixed allocation rate and
allow banks to tender for the volume, as has been the case
since it lowered its discount rate January 22, or else it may
allow banks to tender for the rate and set the volume itself.
    Dealers expect volume of the tender to be lower than the
15.2 billion marks flowing out, to offset other incoming funds.
    Some seven billion marks is expected to flow in next week.
This should then flow back into the market as it is deposited
with banks.
    Banks were well supplied with liquidity, holding 61.5
billion marks in reserves at the Bundesbank on Tuesday.
    Holdings of average daily reserves over the first seven
days of April stood at 59.6 billion marks, still above the
estimated 51 billion required for all of April.

<TITLE>SWEDISH DRUG FIRM ASTRA RISE ON AIDS HOPES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Swedish drug firm AB Astra &lt;ASTS.ST>
shares rose 48 crowns to 690 in the first two hours of trading
on the Stockholm Bourse, amid hopes its research into
anti-viral drugs may have promising results in the treatment of
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).
    Stockbrokers said the shares, which climbed amid heavy
institutional buying, also rose in reaction to an optimistic
assessment of future products in the firm's annual report which
was released this week.
    Brokers Enskilda Fondkommission said in a report this month
that Astra was a world leader in anti-viral drugs.
    Although Enskilda said Astra had not made any breakthrough
in developing a specific drug to treat the Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome it noted that investors were only now
discovering that the firm's approach in the area was promising.
    "It is clear that Astra has a tradition in anti-viral
research which should prove valuable in fighting this disease,"
the report by Enskilda, the investment banking unit of
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken &lt;SEBS.ST>, said.
    Company officials could not be reached for comment on the
causes of today's share rise.

<TITLE>EC LAUNCHES ANTI-DUMPING PROBE ON JAPANESE CHIPS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     BRUSSELS, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community launched an
investigation into allegations of dumping by Japanese
semiconductor makers in a move which diplomats said could mark
an intensification of world trade strains.
    Tokyo already faces a deadline of April 17 from Washington
for the imposition of 300 mln dlrs worth of tariffs on chips it
imports into the U.S.
    The EC Executive Commission said today the European
Electrical Component Manufacturers Association complained that
Japanese firms were selling high capacity EPROM type (erasable
programmable read only memory) chips at unfairly low prices.
    Japan last year took 78 pct of the 170 mln dlr EC EPROM
market, up from 60 pct in 1984. The EC firms said they had been
forced to offer their products at a discount of up to 30 pct in
order to compete with the Japanese.
    The Commission said it believed the Association had given
sufficient elements of proof for dumping to warrant an
investigation, which could lead it to impose duties if it found
the complaints were justified.
    The Commission claims last year's accord between the U.S.
And Japan on microchip pricing gives U.S. Firms privileged
access to the Japanese market.

<TITLE>FINANCE MINISTERS AGREE ON NEED FOR STABILITY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance ministers from seven major
industrialized nations agreed on the need to stabilize
currencies at current levels but said more action was needed to
reduce trade imbalances and sustain economic growth.
    In a communique issued after a four-hour meeting at the
U.S. Treasury that ended last night, the ministers said the
value of the dollar and other currencies was basically correct
now, and they welcomed new measures planned by the Japanese to
boost their economy.
    West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg called it
a "good meeting" and in brief remarks exchanged with reporters
other ministers seemed pleased with its outcome.
    Shortly after the communique was issued and just as foreign
exchange trading opened in Tokyo, the Bank of Japan intervened
again to prevent the yen rising too quickly.
    The communique said, "The ministers and governors reaffirmed
the commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent
Paris meeting. They agreed, however, that further actions will
be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain
global economic expansion and reduce trade imbalances."
    It welcomed the plans set this week by the Japan's ruling
Liberal Democratic Party to stimulate its economy with what the
communique termed "extraordinary and urgent measures" including
an "unprecedented front-end loading of public works
expenditures."
    The meeting of the so-called Group of Seven brought
together ministers and central bank governors of the seven
major industrial democracies, the United States, Japan, West
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.
    The communique said the ministers reaffirmed the commitment
on cooperation reached in a meeting on February 22 in Paris
when they had agreed to stabilize foreign exchange rates at the
then-current levels.
    In the weeks that followed, the dollar continued to fall
against the Japanese yen despite massive dollar purchases by
the Bank of Japan and other central banks and is now trading at
around postwar lows.
    Japan has come under growing criticism from both the United
States and European countries for its only modest efforts to
open its markets to outside competition and to reduce its
exports.
    The communique said Japan affirmed its intention to open
domestic markets to foreign goods and services but did not
elaborate.
    It said the officials "reaffirmed the view that around
current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly
consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy
intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting."

<TITLE>AEGON EXPECTS MODERATE RISE IN 1987 PROFITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    THE HAGUE, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dutch insurer AEGON NV &lt;AEGN.AS>
reported a 6.4 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 327.1 mln
guilders and said it expected a moderate increase in profits
for 1987.
    Total revenue was eight pct lower in 1986 at 7.97 billion
guilders vs 8.7 billion guilders in 1985. The company said its
revenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and a
change in accounting practice. It added that revenues would
have risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred.
    Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainly
due to its life insurance business.
    Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rose
despite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums and
higher personal risks.
    Damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damage
insurances. AEGON did not specify the loss.
    In the United States, revenue in guilders from health and
life insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a change
in accounting for U.S. Annuities.
    AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personal
investment influences that it should be accounted differently
from the more traditional insurances.
    This change in accounting practice and another change to
account for profits made on fixed interest investments,
resulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mln
guilders.
    AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profits
were slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initial
costs for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in The
Hague.
    In 1986, a large number of new insurance products emerged
in the Netherlands and the U.S., AEGON said. Large initial
costs for these products have depressed net profits somewhat.
    Monumental Corp, a U.S. Insurer which merged with AEGON in
May 1986, saw its profits almost completely eroded by these
costs and made only a small contribution to the group's
profits.
    AEGON said it has written-off 657 mln guilders in goodwill
for Monumental Corp.
    AEGON's net equity was 2.71 billion guilders in December
1986, against 3.46 billion the year before.

<TITLE>G-7 ISSUES STATEMENT AFTER MEETING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Following is the text of a statement
by the Group of Seven -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France,
Britain, Italy and Canada -- issued after a Washington meeting
yesterday.
    1. The finance ministers and central bank governors of
seven major industrial countries met today.
    They continued the process of multilateral surveillance of
their economies pursuant to the arrangements for strengthened
economic policy coordination agreed at the 1986 Tokyo summit of
their heads of state or government.
    The managing director of the International Monetary Fund
also participated in the meeting.
    2. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to
the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting,
and noted the progress achieved in implementing the
undertakings embodied in the Louvre Agreement.
    They agreed, however, that further actions will be
essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain
global economic expansion, and reduce trade imbalances.
    In this connection they welcomed the proposals just
announced by the governing Liberal Democratic Party in Japan
for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate Japan's
economy through early implementation of a large supplementary
budget exceeding those of previous years, as well as
unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.
    The government of Japan reaffirmed its intention to further
open up its domestic markets to foreign goods and services.
    3. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that
around current levels their currencies are within ranges
broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic
policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.
    In that connection they welcomed the strong implementation
of the Louvre Agreement.
    They concluded that present and prospective progress in
implementing the policy undertakings at the Louvre and in this
statement provided a basis for continuing close cooperation to
foster the stability of exchange rates.

Miyazawa said the Group of Seven (G-7) countries reaffirmed
their Paris accord on stabilising currencies to convince the
market of their resolve.
    At a news conference after today's G-7 meeting, Miyazawa
said the ministers and central bank governors did not believe a
totally new statement was needed.
    The speculative selling did not reflect economic
fundamentals, and since the fundamentals had not changed only a
reaffirmation of the goals of the Paris accord was needed, he
said.
    He also noted that this test of the G-7 nations resolve had
concentrated on the yen, while other currencies, especially the
mark, had remained stable.
    Miyazawa said any change in economic conditions since the
Paris accord was not worth being called fundamental.
    "As I said at a time of Louvre (agreement), the expression
of 'current level' is rather vague idea," he said.
    The yen's movement in the past several weeks is within the
range agreed in Paris in Febraury, he said.
    It was better to give a vague expression than pin-pointing
a level, which could have an adverse impact on the market,
Miyazawa said.
    Asked why only Japan was committed to fresh measures in the
statement, he said Japan was exceptional among the seven
because the yen appreciated against the dollar while other
major currencies largely have been stable.
    He also said Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has
justed adoped a package to reflate the economy while other
nations are not supposed to produce new measures in a short
period since the Paris agreement.
    Miyazawa also said the U.S. sanctions against Japanese
semiconductor products was not discussed through the G-7
meeting and did not affect the currency talks.
    The seven nations discussed the debt problems of developing
countries and ways to proceed in line with the debt initiative
outlined by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker 18 months ago.

<TITLE>YEN SEEN RISING AFTER G-7 COMMUNIQUE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jeremy Solomons, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The yen is likely to start another
uneven rise against the dollar and other major currencies
because the Group of Seven communique contained nothing new,
currency and bond analysts here said.
    "Is that it? I was expecting something more than that," said
one trader at a major Wall Street securities company.
    Marc Cohen of Republic National Bank of New York said: "The
market now has the impetus to drive the dollar lower again."
    The dollar hovered between 145.50 and 147 yen in the days
just before the talks. Dealers restrained their underlying
bearishness and squared positions ahead of Wednesday's meeting
of the finance ministers and central bankers of the top seven
industrialized nations in Washington.
    After more than four hours of talks, the G-7 issued a
communique which merely reaffirmed the recent Paris agreement's
view that prevailing currency levels were broadly consistent
with economic fundamentals and that exchange rate stability
should be fostered around these levels.
    The dollar sank to 144.75 yen in early Tokyo trading.
    "They said that the dollar/yen rate was broadly in line with
fundamentals when it was 154. Now they are saying it's in line
when it's at 146. Will this still be so at 138 or 130?," asked
Republic's Cohen.
    Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa fuelled
speculation about the amount of fluctuation the authorities are
prepared to tolerate by saying that the current yen level is
still inside the range agreed on in Paris in late February.
    Official statements in recent weeks had indicated that the
key psychological level of 150 yen was at the lower end of the
authorities' permissible range.
    Dealers and analysts warned that the dollar's decline would
probably be uneven. They anticipated a concerted effort to prop
up the dollar and restrain the yen via a mixture of open market
intervention and public comments.
    Shortly after the Tokyo market opened today the Bank of
Japan was detected by local dealers buying moderate amounts of
dollars. The dollar rebounded to about 145.20 yen.
    The sources said the market may also be wary of agressively
selling dollars for yen before Tuesday's February U.S. Trade
data. The figures are expected to show a deficit of 13 billion
dlrs, from a provisional 14.8 billion in January.

<TITLE>JAPAN BUSINESS LEADERS SAY G-7 ACCORD IS WORRYING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The leaders of two of Japan's top business
groups said in separate statements the Group of Seven (G-7)
accord reached in Washington yesterday is of deep concern to
Japan because it shows the major industrial nations regard the
yen's current level as appropriate.
    Eishiro Saito, chairman of the Federation of Economic
Organizations (Keidanren), said the yen's present rate is well
above adequate levels. He did not elaborate.
    Takashi Ishihara, chairman of the Japan Committee for
Economic Development, said the accord will not prevent the yen
from rising further.
    "We do not understand why the G-7 approved present rates as
the yen has risen excessively since the Paris accord," Ishihara
said.
    G-7 members Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the U.S.
And West Germany said in a statement they consider their
currencies are now within ranges broadly consistent with
economic fundamentals.
    Saito called on each G-7 member nation to prepare to
intervene in the market strongly enough to ensure exchange
rates are stabilised at appropriate levels.

<TITLE>EUROPEAN MARKETS REACT QUIETLY TO G-7 COMMUNIQUE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Richard Murphy, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>European currency markets reacted quietly
to the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers
ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to
surprise that the markets should have expected so much.
    The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies
and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which
reaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency
stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.
    Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remaining
broadly entrenched in its current trading range.
    "The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84
marks," said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase Bank
AG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs.
    However, she said the dollar could break out of the range
with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.
Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.
    Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd
in Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against
the mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,
possibly to 140 yen.
    A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects
a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.
    London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb
underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative
sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank
operators to test the downside.
    Concern that finance ministers and officials still in
Washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of
currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with
worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the
long term, the traders said.
    Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the
communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's
downward trend.
    Traders in several centres said the market would look for
fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to
defend current ranges, which the communique said were "broadly
consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy
intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting."
    Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said
"They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon." The
U.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.
    However, some dealers said London-based operators would be
unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long
Easter weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825
marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.
    Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said
the G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable
market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme
volatility seen in the first few months of this year.
    One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the
communique made clear the leading nations did not want a
further dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.
    The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to
1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre
accord's supposed currency target range.
    A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were
ready for a period of "mainly sideways movement."
    But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique
contributing to greater stability.
    "Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big
boost," said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he
expects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks
in the next three months.

<TITLE>FAO SEES LOWER GLOBAL WHEAT, GRAIN OUTPUT IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation
(FAO) said global wheat and coarse grain output was likely to
fall in 1987 but supplies would remain adequate to meet demand.
    FAO said in its monthly food outlook bulletin total world
grain output was expected to fall 38 mln tonnes to 1,353 mln in
1987, due mainly to unusually high winter losses in the Soviet
Union, drought in China and reduced plantings in North America.
    World cereal stocks at the end of 1986/87 were forecast to
rise 47 mln tonnes to a record 452 mln tonnes, softening the
impact of reduced production. But stocks are unevenly
distributed, with about 50 pct held by the U.S.
    "Thus the food security prospects in 1987/88 for many
developing countries, particularly in Africa, depend crucially
on the outcome of this year's harvests," FAO said.
    FAO said world cereal supplies in 1986/87 were estimated at
a record 2,113 mln tonnes, about five pct higher than last
season and due mainly to large stocks and a record 1986
harvest, estimated at 1,865 mln tonnes.
    FAO's forecast of 1986/87 world cereals trade was revised
upwards by eight mln tonnes to 179 mln due to the likelihood of
substantial buying by China and the Soviet Union.

<TITLE>INDIAN STATE COMPANY BONDS PROVOKE COMPLAINTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Ajoy Sen, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW DELHI, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>India's private businessmen say they
have been placed on an unequal footing in raising money from
the capital market because government companies are wooing
investors by issuing more attractive tax-free bonds.
    Stock brokers and bankers polled by Reuters said although
equity shares or debenture issues floated by private firms
provide a higher return and shorter maturity, they are fast
losing their popular appeal as they are liable to both wealth
and income taxes.
    Brokers said many investors are transferring funds into
government company bonds because of their tax-free status and
easy transferability.
    About 100 private companies have postponed plans to issue
equity shares and debentures in the first quarter of fiscal
1987/88 partly on account of fierce competition from public
sector bonds, a merchant banker said.
    They included equity shares and rights issue worth one
billion rupees planned to be issued this month by Tata
Fertilisers Ltd, he said, adding the issue has been postponed
indefinitely.
    "The government bonds are making serious inroads on the
private sector companies' resources," said R. P. Goenka,
president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and
Industry.
    "The discriminatory tax treatment should be done away with
and equal facilities be provided to the two sectors to mobilise
resources from the market which is common to both," Goenka said.
    A senior Finance Ministry official said government and
private firms were free to compete to raise resources, adding
it was not correct that public sector-issued bonds were
preventing private firms from raising money on the stock
market.
    "Debentures and equity shares floated by private companies
still account for at least 60 pct of total capital raised in
stock exchanges," the ministry official said.
    A spokesman at Bombay stock brokers Batliwala and Karani
said government bonds were valued at about 20 billion rupees or
about 40 pct of 50 billion rupees raised by both government and
non-government firms in the domestic capital market in 1986/87.
    The share was 35 to 40 pct of about 36.95 billion rupees
mobilised in 1985/86, he said. "To save taxes, commercial banks,
mainly foreign banks, and some private companies, are investing
their surplus funds in the tax free bonds," he said.
    "Individuals who are very well off are also investing in the
bonds to gain tax benefits while only small investors are going
for equities or debentures floated by private companies on a
selective basis," the spokesman said.
    The maturity period of government company bonds varies
between seven and 10 years. No wealth or income taxes are
payable on nine pct seven-year bonds but those carrying 13 pct
interest on 10-year bonds are subjected to income tax if interest amount^M
exceeds 7,000 rupees a year.
    Equity shares, the 14 pct non-convertible debentures and
12.5 to 14 pct convertible debentures issued by private
companies are not exempted from either the wealth tax or from
the tax on income earned from them.
    The government bonds are listed as securities but traded on
India's four major stock exchanges. They can be sold freely on
the stock market by simple endorsement while debentures can
only be sold to the company after one year, brokers said.
    Government companies are trying to capitalise on a boom in
the stock market since 1984/85 sparked by liberal tax
concessions and reforms in exchange operations, brokers said.
    The National Thermal Power Corp, NTPC, was the first
government company to issue the bonds to raise one billion
rupees in January last year, breaking the monopoly of private
companies on the capital market. The seven-year NTPC bond was
oversubscribed three times, brokers said.
    Official figures show bonds floated by government companies
have been heavily oversubscribed. More state companies have
sought the Ministry's permission to issue them in coming
months.
    NTPC's second bond issue at the end of 1986 raised 4.51
billion rupees against 1.2 billion originally permitted by the
Finance Ministry.
    The Mahanagar Telephone Nigam mobilised 3.83 billion rupees
last year against authorised 1.5 billion and last month the
Indian Railway Finance Corporation's record susbcription
totalled 5.5 billion rupees against authorised 2.5 billion.
    In most cases, the government has allowed the companies to
maintain the oversubscribed amount, brokers said.
    Goenka said that government bonds are making it
increasingly difficult for private companies to launch new
equity or debenture issues. He said the government could at
least "fix a suitable limit on the funds to be raised through
such bonds by the public sector."
    Merchant bankers said the government is pressing state
companies to borrow from the public by reducing financial
support to them.
    To ease its internal debt burden, the government has
reduced the budgetary support to development investment in
about 120 public sector companies to 69.92 billion rupees in
1987/88 from 77.92 billion a year earlier, official figures
show.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The leaders of two of Japan's top business
groups said in separate statements the Group of Seven (G-7)
accord reached in Washington yesterday is of deep concern to
Japan because it shows the major industrial nations regard the
yen's current level as appropriate.
    Eishiro Saito, chairman of the Federation of Economic
Organizations (Keidanren), said the yen's present rate is well
above adequate levels. He did not elaborate.
    Takashi Ishihara, chairman of the Japan Committee for
Economic Development, said the accord will not prevent the yen
from rising further.
    "We do not understand why the G-7 approved present rates as
the yen has risen excessively since the Paris accord," Ishihara
said.

<TITLE>PHYSIO TECHNOLOGY &lt;PHYT> SEES LOSS, IN DEFAULT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOPEKA, Kan., April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Physio Technology Inc said it
expects to have a third quarter, ended March 31, loss of about
200,000 dlrs and is in default on its bank loan because of the
resignation of chairman and chief executive officer.
    The company said the loss followed four quarters of modest
profits. In the year ago quarter it earned 11,000 dlrs, or one
cent a share. For the first half of fiscal 1987, it reported a
profit of 42,000 dlrs, or two cts a share, compared to a year
earlier loss of 294,000 dlrs, or 17 cts a share.
    It said President Michael R. Hall will assume the duties of
chief executive officer.
    Physio Technology said the resignation of Chairman James C.
Lane can constitute non-compliance with its Series A
convertible subordinated debentures due 1996 and a default
under its agreement with the Merchants Bank of Kansas City.
    It explained a declaration of non-compliance under the
debentures would create a a default under the loan agreements
requiring immediate payment of 1.8 mln dlrs of debentures and
about 450,000 dlrs outstanding under the bank credit line.
    The company said the debenture holders intend to waive the
non-compliance, but reserve the right to withdraw the waiver at
the end of any 30 day period.
    Physio Technology said it is changing its field sales force
to independent representatives and dealers from employees to
"significantly reduce its fixed overhead."
    Its statement did not indicate how many employees would be
affected by the move.
    The company said Lane will become an independent dealter
for the company in certain midwestern states. He will continue
to serve as a director, it added.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, APRIL 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Traders expect U.S. energy futures will
open unchanged to slightly lower this morning with support near
yesterday's lows.
    Crude futures are called unchanged to five cts weaker
tracking unchanged domestic crudes and North Sea Brent crude,
which traded at 18.01 dlrs a barrel today, about ten cts below
yesterday's New York close.
    Traders said the supply squeeze in 15-day forward April
Brent appears to have ended.
    Product futures, which fell sharply yesterday, are due to
open unchanged to 0.25 cent lower, traders said.
    Traders expect some followthrough selling in products but
said gasoil futures in London will probably lend some support
since they are trading as expected. May gasoil futures were off
1.50 dlrs a tonne this morning while June was down 1.25 dlrs in
thin conditions.

<DATELINE>    BEIRUT, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Lebanese Pound fell sharply against
the U.S. Dollar again today with dealers attributing the
decline to continued political uncertainty.
    The pound closed at 118.25/118.75 against the dollar
compared to yesterday's close of 115.60/115.80.
    "Political deadlock is reflected in the pound's position.
There was more demand and less on offer in the market," one
dealer told Reuters.
    The pound, which was at 18 to the dollar in January, 1986,
has lost more than 30 pct of its international value over the
past three months.

<TITLE>LONDON FREIGHT MARKET FEATURES GRAIN OUT OF U.S.</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Moderately active grain fixing was
reported out of the U.S. But none of the business involved the
significant voyages to the Continent or Japan, ship brokers
said.
    A steady 13.50 dlrs was paid from the U.S. Gulf to Morocco
and 23.25 dlrs was paid for 27,000 long tons from the Gulf to
Taiwan. A vessel carrying 13,500 long tons of bagged wheat
flour from the Gulf to Aqaba received a lump sum of 472,500
dlrs.
    Grain from the Great Lakes to Algeria made 28 dlrs against
27.75 paid for similar fixing towards the end of March.
    Market talk suggested a Federal Commerce vessel had been
booked to move grain from the Great Lakes to Morocco on Comanav
account at about 22 dlrs and 15.50 had been paid for a cargo of
oilseeds from British Columbia to Japan, but no confirmation
was obtainable.
    On the Continent, shippers agreed 19 dlrs for wheat from La
Pallice to Buenaventura and 10.75 dlrs for grain from Ghent to
Naples/Venice range. Elsewhere, maize from East London to Japan
paid 22 dlrs.
    Soviet charterers reappeared in the timecharter sector and
secured a 30,000 tonner from Savona for a trans-Atlantic round
trip at 4,450 dlrs daily and a 31,000 tonner from
Antwerp-Hamburg for a similar voyage at 4,250 dlrs daily.

<TITLE>BUNDESBANK SEES NO CHANGE IN MONETARY COURSE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bundesbank sees no current reason
to change monetary course, vice-president Helmut Schlesinger
told Reuters in a telephone interview.
    Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks
yesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and West
Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss, which, dealers
said, revived some speculation that German interest rate cuts
may once again be under discussion.
    Schlesinger said he had no comment on the remarks of his
two central bank council colleagues.
    But he added that the last central bank council meeting on
April 2 had discussed the economic situation with a mood of
"subdued optimism," particularly influenced by the news brought
by several state central bank presidents.
    "Much is going better than the impression gained by the
public from the January figures, which have been in the
meantime superseded," he said.
    German January industrial output fell 3.0 pct after a
decline of 0.9 pct in December. New industry orders fell 1.9
pct after they had been unchanged in December.
    Bank economists said that the two together showed the
economy would either stagnate or contract in the first quarter
of 1987.
    Aside from the economic developments, Schlesinger added, a
steady monetary course was important to hold the dollar/mark
rate around current levels as Bundesbank president Karl Otto
Poehl had said while attending the Washington World Bank/IMF
meeting.
    Asked, however, if the Bundesbank could move to cut rates
on repurchase agreements at the setting of the next repurchase
tender, due next Tuesday, Schlesinger said, "Since the central
bank council gives its opinion on this theme only every 14
days, this is hardly probable."
    Responding to the question whether the Bundesbank had moved
away from a policy of targetting monetary growth toward one of
targetting currency rates, Schlesinger said he could have no
comment on the subject while negotiations were still in
progress in Washington.

current account deficits, the Ministry of Finance said.
    It said Bank President Barber Conable at a meeting with Sri
Lanka's Finance Minister Ronnie de Mel in Washington also
emphasised the need for structural adjustment and reform to the
economy, battered by five years of separatist disturbances.
    Officials said Sri Lanka's budget deficit this year is
expected to surpass the projected 28.7 billion rupees while
defence spending, already up by two billion rupees from a
targetted 10 billion, is also likely grow.
    The Ministry said de Mel asked the World Bank to give Sri
Lanka 6.5 billion rupees balance of payments support.

<TITLE>U.S. SAID TO VIEW G-7 MEETING AS MAJOR SUCCESS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Torday, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9  - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States, which has long
sought Japanese action to stimulate its economy, appears to be
satisfied Tokyo's latest package is a major development and
allows leading industrial nations to reaffirm their agreement
to stabilize currencies.
    Monetary sources said they believed that U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker considered Tokyo's package, announced
yesterday, to be a major stimulation of the Japanese economy.
    But yesterday's statement by seven leading industrial
powers endorses the yen's rise from around 153 to the dollar,
the level at the February 22 Paris Accord, to about 145 today.
    And the initial reaction of currency markets in the Far
East demonstrates that financial markets are unconvinced that
currencies yet reflect economic fundamentals, even though the
countries appear to do so. The yen sank below 145 at one point
despite intervention by the Bank of Japan.
    Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's Finance Minister, said the
movement since Paris was consistent with currency trading
ranges the nations agreed to defend in the February talks.
    "I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the past
several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the
discussions in Paris," Miyazawa said yesterday.
    The supplementary budget worth about 34.48 billion dlrs was
announced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve of
Miyazawa's departure for Washington, to attend yesterday's
meetings of leading industrial nations.
    In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action
"extraordinary and urgent", the meeting reaffirmed the Paris
Accord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges
broadly consistent with fundamentals, or economic reality.
    The Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, West
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- therefore
repeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to
foster exchange rate stability.
    The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central
bank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt the
dollar's fall. While relatively unsuccessful, the scale of
intervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent
years. Monetary sources also said they understood that
Secretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremely
successful in the light of the Japanese announcement.
    They also said there was a growing feeling among the
finance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over
medium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-term
differences in past meetings.
    West Germany, whose currency has not risen anything like
the yen since the Paris Agreement, appears from the face of
yesterday's statement to have won acceptance from other
countries that its exchange rate is acceptable.
    Bonn's finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues that
major currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance
between West Germany and Japan's trade surpluses and America's
trade deficit have already taken place.
    No mention was made, however, of the U.S. commitment to cut
the budget deficit even though it is implied in the
reafffirmation of Paris.
    European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts are
essential to curbing the record U.S. trade shortfall that
reached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year.
    A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier this
week by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. A further
sharp fall to redress trade imbalances would "clearly pose
substantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could
undermine confidence in future financial stability," he said.
    Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the
politically independent Fed to drive up interest rates.
    Monetary sources said that, privately, West Germany
welcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own
currency remained relatively stable against the U.S. unit.
    Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weak
dollar blunts Tokyo's export drive to the United States, the
Japanese monolith will concentrate on European markets.
    The ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on making
their policy coordination more binding and one, Canadian
Finance Minister Michael Wilson, said good progress was made.
    Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summit
to prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations.
    The United States and France, backed by the International
Monetary Fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or "norms" for a
limited number of economic objectives such as growth,
inflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and current
account balances.
    Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in
consultations between the countries on whether corrective
action should be required.
    But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives
has Bonn and London worried, monetary sources say, because it
implies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones.
    The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfully
sounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit
currency fluctuations just before the February meeting.
    The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges
of the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from the
relatively free currency markets of recent years.

<TITLE>GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN RAISES NEW DEBT FEARS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alver Carlson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The global economy is expected to
weaken this year, adding new worries to an already serious
poverty outlook, economic analysts said.
    For finance ministers and central bankers attending this
week's semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund
and World Bank, the new figures released by the IMF add an
additional concern.
    The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pct
this year, versus 2.9 pct last year, and 3.1 pct in 1985.
    In the industrial countries, Gross National Product, a
measure of all goods and services, was expected to decline to
2.3 pct this year, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986, the IMF said.
    For the developing countries, the Gross Domestic Product,
another measure of economic growth, was expected to fall to 3.0
pct from 3.5 pct last year.
    The new figures are considered a major disappointment to
the poorest countries. They had hoped that new vitality in the
industrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oil
prices would assist their economic recovery and help them cope
with growing mounds of debt.
    IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believed
the industrial country economies would move up to an annual
growth rate of three pct by the end of the decade.
    Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for some
time that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning into
an economic rout rests on sustained economic growth.
    Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthier
states for markets for their products as well as financial
assistance, economic weakness in the developed nations' 
economies poses fundamental worries.
    Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, have
only a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange,
including the key one of exports.
    The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion,
has served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but it
too is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only
2.3 pct, according to the IMF.
    For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, the
United States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany to
ignite their economies but with little apparent success.
    The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar and
the curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. trade
deficit.
    Reagan administration officials have been saying that the
impact is now beginning to show up, although it has been much
slower than expected.
    The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that "it has
to be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time to
work through to payments flows -- probably at least three years
to get a resonably complete effect."
    The report added, however, "the adjustments may take even
more time on this occasion."

<TITLE>SPANISH EMPLOYERS WORRIED BY HIGH INTEREST RATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MADRID, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The head of Spain's employers'
federation, Jose Maria Cuevas, said employers were worried
about the government's monetary policies because high real
interest rates were hampering investment.
    He told a news conference wage pacts signed so far this
year were not endangering the government's five pct inflation
target. The government's perceived need to control inflation by
keeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said.
    High real interest rates were attracting an influx of
speculative foreign capital which was undercutting the
government's target for monetary growth, Cuevas said.
    Spain's most closely-watched measure of money supply,
liquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17
pct in March, against 11.4 pct in December last year and a
target range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987.
    To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call money
rate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from
11.8 at end-1986.
    Cuevas said employers were heeding the government's call to
hold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year,
with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and new
wage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987.
    These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanish
workers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations.
    He said Spain's current wave of strikes mainly affected the
state sector, where the government is trying to impose its five
pct wage ceiling.
    Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend in
Spain's foreign trade balance. The trade deficit in the first
two months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas, a 68 pct
increase over the corresponding period last year.
    However, employers did not favour a devaluation of the
peseta to correct the imbalance.

<TITLE>LEAD PRICES RISE ON FINELY BALANCED PHYSICALS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Donald Bradshaw, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Lead prices have risen this week against
a background of a finely balanced physical sector, traders
said.
    Further gains are possible if the USSR steps up its buying
or if labour problems develop in North America, they added.
    London Metal Exchange (LME) prices are unusually buoyant at
a time of year when seasonal demand is normally slackening and
prices tending to drift lower.
    This buoyancy is generally attributed by traders to the low
level of LME stocks and steady, if unspectacular, physical
demand in the Northern Hemisphere finding supplies curtailed.
    The supply problems are not new but are beginning to be
felt by a market in which, as peak winter demand tails off,
stocks usually build fast and availability increases, traders
said.
    The lower supply levels result from a number of different
factors around the globe.
    Delayed shipments from Peru to Mediterranean countries
because of production and transport problems, lack of Spanish
exports since the closure last year of Cia La Cruz's smelter at
Linares and lower output in Morocco and Greece have all meant
additional demand being directed to merchants who in turn have
been drawing on LME stocks.
    In addition Broken Hill Associated Smelters' Port Pirie,
South Australia, smelter is halting production for five weeks
for maintenance. Although the company said it would meet
commitments, this will put further pressure on stocks.
    And the U.S. Company Doe Run has kept its 140,000 tonnes
per year Boss, Montana smelter closed. This cut producer stocks
and contributed to a closer supply/demand balance within the
U.S. Market, for many years depressed by surplus production and
a regular supplier to the world market.
    Mexican supplies, which have sometimes swelled LME stocks,
have been normal but are finding ready buyers, traders said.
    On the demand side, winter battery manufacture has held up
quite well and some U.S. Buying of lead sheet has been reported
in the U.K. Soviet lead buying, notably absent in Europe in the
first two months of the year, was resumed when a large buying
order was filled by merchants in March.
    Merchant demand has fuelled the rise in LME lead prices
this week and has seen cash metal move above 320 stg and
establish a premium of around 10 stg over three months
delivery. Specific demand has been directed towards metal in
Gothenburg and Trieste warehouses. Gothenburg material is often
a target for merchants shipping to the USSR, traders said.
    On stocks, the popular LME Continental warehouses, Antwerp
and Rotterdam, have little more than 3,000 tonnes of lead each,
and this is believed to be in strong hands.
    Out of a total 22,125 tonnes in LME stocks, the lowest
level since June 1980, just over half is in U.K. Warehouses
which are not popular with merchants putting together
shipments.
    But even U.K. Stocks have dropped around 6,000 tonnes since
the start of the year. Traders said this is partly due to
secondary smelters buying ingots to supplement feed supplies
affected by environmental controls, which put restrictions on
the transport of used batteries.
    Labour negotiations in North America will play an important
part in determining the direction of prices, with contracts
expiring end-April at Cominco's Trail and Kimberley, B.C.,
Mine/smelter and at Doe Run's Herculaneum, Mo, smelter.
    Noranda's New Brunswick mine/smelter also has a contract
expiry in July which may cause some nervousness in view of
strikes by its zinc and copper workers over recent months.
    Traders said LME three months delivery, already attracting
speculative buying, could rise to 320/330 stg on current
firmness, while nearby tightness could widen the cash premium
to 20 from four. Three months was quoted at 313 stg at
midsession.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>E.F. Hutton LBO Inc said the tender
offer by its wholly owned unit, PC Acquisition Inc, for
Purolator Courier Corp &lt;PCC> expired at 2400 EDT yesterday
without the purchase of any Purolator common stock.
    Hutton added that PC Acquisition also terminated its merger
agreement with Purolator.
    Hutton said the offer, which had been conditioned upon the
tender of at least 5,116,892 Purolator shares, or about
two-thirds of the outstanding shares, was terminated because
the minimum number of shares was not tendered.
    Purolator had entered into a definitive agreement with PC
Acquisition, part-owned by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc, a unit of E.F.
Hutton, and some officers of Purolator's U.S. courier division,
in which PC offered to purchase 6,332,471 Purolator common
stock shares for 35 dlrs a share.
    Following that move, PC Acquisition planned to merge a
subsidiary into Purolator, converting all outstanding Purolator
common it did not own into an aggregate 46 mln dlrs principal
amount of 12 pct guaranteed debentures due 2002 and warrants to
purchase 15 pct of a Purolator unit comprised of Purolator's
U.S courier operations.
    Hutton said as of 2400 EDT yesterday about 181,000 shares
of Purolator common stock, or about 2.4 pct of the outstanding
shares, had been validly tendered and not withdrawn.
    PC Acquisition has instructed its depository for the offer
to return promptly the Purolator stock deposited by, or on
behalf of, tendering shareholders, Hutton said.

<TITLE>INDIA FOODGRAIN TARGET 160 MLN TONNES IN 1987/88</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW DELHI, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>India's national foodgrain target has
been fixed at 160 mln tonnes in 1987/88 (Apr-Mar), unchanged
from the 1986/87 target, the Agriculture Ministry said in its
annual report for 1986/87.
    Actual output was estimated at 151 mln tonnes in 1986/87
due to failure of monsoon rains in 15 out of 35 meterological
sub-divisions of the country.
    The report gave the targets for various crops with
estimated harvested crops in 1986/87 in brackets as following,
in mln tonnes - rice 65 (60), wheat 49 (49), coarse grains
including sorghum and millets 32 (29) and pulses 14 (13).
    Despite failure of monsoon rains in recent years, it was
possible to maintain higher foodgrain production, signifying
growing resilience in agricultural sector, the report said.
    The strategy for increasing irrigation potential along with
greater use of high yielding seed varieites and improvement in
fertiliser efficiency is yielding results, it said, adding
total foodgrain output in 1985/86, 1984/85 and 1983/84
respectively was 150.5 mln tonnes, 145.5 mln and a record 152.4
mln.
   India has targeted to produce between 178 and 183 mln tonnes
of foodgrains by the last year of the seventh five-year
development plan ending March 31, 1990.
    Taking the midpoint of 180 mln tonnes as the target and the
1986/87 estimated production of around 151 mln tonnes, the gap
of 29 mln tonnes has to be made up during the remaining three
years of the plan by increasing grain output annually by more
than nine mln tonnes. But the target can be achieved only with
good weather, the report said.
    "The major thrust programme will, therefore, be better water
(irrigation) management. Simultaneously, efforts for spread of
improved technology including timely use of inputs (farm
materials like fertilisers) in adequate quantities have to be
vigrously pursued," it said.

<TITLE>REICHHOLD CHEMICAL &lt;RCI> SETS ANTI-TAKEOVER PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WHITE PLAINS, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Reichhold Chemical Inc said its
board adopted a warrant dividend plan in which one preferred
stock purchase right will be distributed as a dividend on each
common share outstanding.
    The company said its warrant dividend plan is designed to
protect its shareholders against unsolicted, coercive attempts
to aquire control without making an adequate offer for all
shares.
    Reichhold said the adoption is not a response to any
specific takeover attempt.
    Reichhold said each right will entitle shareholders to buy
one one-hundreth of a share of a newly created series of
preferred stock at an initial exercise price of 120 dlrs, with
dividend and voting rights approximately equal to those of one
share of the company's common stock.
    The rights will be exercisable only if, without Reichhold's
prior consent, a person or group a acquires 20 pct or more of
the voting power or announces a tender offer which would result
in 20 pct ownership, the company said.
    Reichhold said it is entitled to redeem the rights at five
cts apiece before a 20 pct position has been acquired, or
before an existing 20 pct shareholder buys an additional two
pct or more of the voting power of the company, or in
connection with certain transactions afterward.
    The tax-free distribution will become effective May 1,
1987, and will expire 10 years later, the company said.
    Details of the plan are outlined in a letter to be mailed
to stockholders.

surplus in February compared with a 68 mln dlr surplus in
January and a 355 mln dlr surplus in February last year, Bank
of Spain figures show.
    Spain's trade deficit narrowed to 581 mln dlrs compared
with 664 mln dlrs in January but the large increase in non-oil
imports contributed to the substantial increase over the 159
mln dlr deficit registered in February 1986.
    Exports at 2.58 billion dlrs were up 19 pct compared with
February last year, but imports were 46 pct higher than last
February, totalling 3.16 billion dlrs.
    Non-oil imports totalled 2.79 billion dlrs compared with
1.91 billion in February last year, reflecting the large
ammount of investment goods entering the country with the
recovery of the Spanish economy, the Bank of Spain said.
    Spain's tourism earnings continued to grow and totalled 655
mln dlrs in February, compared with 103 mln dlrs in January and
502 mln dlrs in February last year.

mln in 1985/86 but down from 12.95 mln harvested in 1984/85,
the Agriculture Ministry's 1986/87 report said.
    But the forecast for 1986/87 is well below a target of 14.8
mln tonnes fixed for the year, it said, adding bad weather hit
groundnut and other oilseed crops.
    The National Oilseeds Development Program will invest 300
mln rupees in 1986/87 on supplying improved high-yielding seeds
and other support services to help boost production, it added.
India imports about 1.2 mln tonnes of edible oils a year.

<TITLE>VW SAYS 480 MLN MARKS MAXIMUM FOR CURRENCY LOSSES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WOLFSBURG, West Germany, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Losses for Volkswagen AG
&lt;VOWG.F>, VW, linked to an alleged foreign currency fraud will
not exceed the 480 mln marks provision already made, a VW
spokesman said.
    The spokesman was commenting after VW had confirmed it
would pay an unchanged 10 mark dividend for ordinary shares on
1986 business, despite the provision.
    One West German newspaper today quoted foreign currency
dealers in Frankfurt as speculating that the total losses from
the currency affair could be as high as 1.5 billion marks, but
the VW spokesman described 480 mln marks as an "upper limit."
    VW said in a statement following today's supervisory board
meeting that it had discussed the foreign currency scandal in
detail, and was setting up a new probe into its foreign
currency activities to be carried out by an unnamed auditing
company.
    VW has said computer programs were erased and documents
were faked in the alleged fraud in which it believes
transactions intended to protect it against possible foreign
currency losses were not completed.
    VW's former foreign currency chief Burkhard Junger was
arrested on Monday on suspicion of embezzlement and of having
evaded justice.
    Earlier VW had said that its 1986 results would match 1985
profits. VW's group net profit in 1985 was 596 mln marks and
parent company net was 477 mln marks. It also said it recommend
an unchanged dividend to the supervisory board. The company has
also set a dividend of 11 marks for new preference shares,
which were issued last year. Analysts have described the held
dividend as a move to reassure worried shareholders.
    VW increased nominal capital by 300 marks last year to 1.5
billion marks, with the result that its total dividend payment
on 1986 will be 306 mln marks compared with 240 mln on 1985,
since the new capital was in preference shares.
    The share analysts say VW will have to dig into reserves in
order to maintain the disclosed 1986 profit at 1985 levels. At
the end of 1985, VW had parent company reserves of slightly
less than three billion marks.

<DATELINE>    MINNEAPOLIS, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>National Computer Systems Inc
expects fiscal year earnings to improve by about 20 pct, the
company told analysts, although it said the April 30 first
quarter should show "down earnings and virtually flat
revenues."
    Chairman Charles Oswald said National Computer has taken
steps to improve margins. He said revenues are expected to
increase modestly because of the company's decision to downsize
its leasing business, nonrecurring revenueslast year from a
one-time Texas teacher assessment project and the impact of the
discontinuance of products last year.
    Oswald said National Computer's first quarter results will
be down as a result of a major financial systems sales last
year, a higher effective tax rate and the increased number of
shares outstanding.
    The company said the next three consecutive quarters should
demonstrate "excellent earnings growth."

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>LAWSON SAYS SOME COUNTRIES COULD CUT RATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Nigel Lawson, Britain's Chancellor of
the Exchequer, said some countries may need to cut interest
rates with the aim of maintaining exchange rate stability.
    Speaking to journalists one day after the Group of Seven
countries reaffirmed goals set in Paris six weeks ago, he said
central banks would continue to intervene "as and when
necessary."
    He said the G-7 countries were concerned that Japan do more
to stimulate domestic demand and welcomed measures outlined by
Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa yesterday.
    Lawson said he was still worried about  the risk of a
simultaneous recession in the United States, Japan and West
Germany, though less so than when he gave his March 17 budget
speech to the British Parliament.
    "If anything I'm a little bit less concerned, but there is
still a risk," he said.
    Asked if the United States should consider increasing
interest rates to support the dollar, he said, "If there is a
need for changes in relative interest rates, it doesn't need to
be a rise in interest rates in the United States."
    Lawson said there was some concern expressed in yesterday's
meetings at the slow progress the United States had made in
reducing its budget deficit.
    "We believe there will be some worthwhile progress in
reducing the deficit this year. The important thing is that it
continue year after year," Lawson said.
    The February 22 Louvre accord called for efforts to
stabilize currencies at then-current exchange rates. In the six
weeks that followed the Japanese yen continued to rise against
the dollar despite massive central bank intervention.
    Asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness in
the Louvre accord, he said, "I don't think so. If there had been
no intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness."
    Although intervention could be a cause of inflation, Lawson
said, "the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode
... but one has to be vigilant."
    He said yesterday's G-7 statement, which affirmed that
"current levels" of exchange rates were appropriate, had been
"carefully worded." "We know what we mean, and we all mean the
same thing," he said.
    Lawson said financial markets seem to believe that Japanese
measures outlined in the Louvre accord were the source of
weakness for that agreement.
    Therefore, the G-7 countries welcomed Miyazawa's
presentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulate
domestic demand.
    They particularly welcomed the goal of an immediate
increase in public works spending, but Lawson said the package
also involved a second stage to increase expenditures during
the second half of this year.

<TITLE>U.K. POTATO FUTURES TRADING NOT TO BE SUSPENDED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Trading on the London potato futures
market will not be suspended, Richard Harris, Chairman of the
London Potato Futures Association (LPFA), said in a statement
to floor members.
    It was in response to strong representations by the Potato
Marketing Board (PMB) complaining of a gross distortion of
price which they say will result in large deliveries into the
physical market when the April futures position expires.
    The PMB had sought an immediate suspension in futures
trading and asked the LPFA to take action to restore the
relationship between futures and physicals.
    Farmers and merchants have alleged a squeeze and cornering
of the market but Harris pointed out that recent investigations
by the Association of Futures Brokers and Dealers (AFBD), the
International Commodities Clearing House (ICCH) and other
parties, found no evidence to substantiate this.
    The main complaint from some sections of the physical
market is what they say is an unrealistic futures premium over
the PMB's average ex-farm price. April futures traded this
morning between 168 and 170 stg per tonne compared with PMB's
average price of 104 stg.
    Bill Englebright, joint secretary of the LPFA said there is
a two-tier market for physical potatoes. He said quality
potatoes are in short supply and prepackers have been paying
between 145 and 165 stg per tonne for best samples. But lesser
quality grades have traded below 100 stg.
    Some merchants fear that a large tonnage will be delivered
against the April futures contract between now and the end of
the month, and possibly disrupt the physical market.
    Harris said the LPFA rule book allows the management
committee to take steps as necessary to correct any malpractice
and he assured the committee is monitoring the situation.

<TITLE>DOLLAR ENDS LOWER IN LACKLUSTRE FRANKFURT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Allan Saunderson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The dollar drifted down to end one
pfennig lower after a lacklustre session, held in limits by the
lack of concrete news from the Group of Seven meeting and
comments on the edge of the Washington IMF/World Bank meeting.
    Dealers said the communique early in the European morning
from the G-7 meeting contained no significant new factors and
although the dollar dipped it generally resisted further
attempts to push it lower through the day.
    The U.S. Currency ended at 1.8270/80 marks, below
yesterday's last 1.8365/75.
    Koch said the assessment of the dollar's direction was
based on a global view, with operators paying most attention to
comments by finance officials to see how closely they stated
adherence to international agreements such as those set at the
Plaza Hotel in 1985 and in Paris on February 22.
    Koch described the wording of the communique from the G-7
as "soft as wax."
    Bundebank vice-president Helmut Schlesinger told Reuters in
a telephone interview that the German central bank sees no
current reason to change monetary course at present.
    Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks
yesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and West
Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss, which dealers
said revived some speculation that German interest rate cuts
may be under consideration.
    German call money was slightly softer today, at around 3.70
pct after 3.80 yesterday.
    Some dealers said rates on new liquidity injections added
via Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements may be cut next
week. Hopes of a cut were dashed on Tuesday with an allocation
at an unchanged 3.80 pct.
    But speaking of the pact tender rate next week, Schlesinger
said, "since the central bank council gives its opinion on this
theme only every 14 days, this is hardly probable."
    Euromark rates scarcely responded to the central bankers
comments, with six months funds ending unaltered at around
3-7/8 pct. Eurodollars for the same maturity rose a fractional
1/16 pct from yesterday to around 6-11/16 pct.
    Sterling dipped to end at 2.952/956 marks after 2.960/965
last night. The Swiss franc firmed slightly to 120.30/45 marks
per 100 from 120.25/40, with the yen soaring however to
1.2570/90 marks per 100 from 1.2515/35 yesterday.
    EMS currencies saw the French franc end unchanged from last
night at 30.03/06 marks per 100, with the Belgian franc easing
however to 4.829/831 marks per 100 from 4.831/833.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>TALKING POINT/STEEL COMPANIES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Steven Radwell, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Steel stocks, which have had a healthy
runup recently, still present some short term investment
opportunities, according to some steel analysts.
    But others say the upturn, based on strong orders and firm
prices this spring, has been strictly seasonal and will end
soon. They recommend taking profits.
    "It's that time of year. This is strictly seasonal," said
Charles Bradford of Merrill Lynch and Co. "Orders will be
strong for about two months, and there are signs that some
(order rates) are starting to dive already."
    But Dean Witter Reynolds Inc analyst Clarence Morrison sees
some short-term potential in the group, which includes USX Corp
&lt;X>, Bethlehem Steel Corp &lt;BS>, Armco Inc &lt;AS> and Inland Steel
Industries Inc &lt;IAD>.
    "There is still some attractiveness to steels over the
short- to intermediate-term based on improved order rates and
rising prices," Morrison said. He only recommends one stock,
however, Inland, which is modernizing steelmaking operations to
make them more efficient.
    Despite his bearishness, Merrill's Bradford continues to
recommend Armco, which he sees as a major turnaround.
    Armco's steelmaking operations are profitable, the balance
sheet has been improved, and its oilfield equipment business
has been slimmed and put in a joint venture with USX, Bradford
noted. "It's not a high-quality investment situation yet but
they've come a long way," he said.
    "We think the stock will do moderately better than the
market," he said. Armco shares, trading off 1/4 at 10 today,
could go to 12, and possibly as high as 15, he said.
    Bradford sees Armco earning 50 to 75 cts a share in 1987,
before special gains from recouped investment tax credits,
against losses last year.
    Armco's 1988 earnings could be significantly higher, he
said.
    Bradford is recommending sale of USX shares. "We had a buy
on it below 20 but when it gets to 28, let somebody else have
it," he said.
    The steel and energy concern will earn about one dlr a
share in 1987, about half of that coming from asset sales, and
from two dlrs to 2.50 dlrs in 1988, Bradford said. "But a lot
depends on oil prices," he added. About 60 pct of USX's sales
come from oil and natural gas.
    Other analysts, including Michelle Galanter Applebaum of
Salomon Brothers Inc, recommend USX. "The company's done a lot
(of restructuring), more than the market's given them credit
for," she said.
    She sees the stock going to the mid 30s or higher. USX was
trading up 1/8 at 28-1/2. She predicts USX will earn 18 cts a
share this year and 2.73 dlrs next year against large losses in
1986.
    Applebaum, who is also positive on Armco and Inland, has
been recommending the stocks since last November.
    Peter Marcus of Painewebber Inc is neutral on the group
although he said the earnings outlook is improved through the
third quarter.
    But he sees potential trouble beyond then. "I think (steel)
prices on a bookings basis will start to drop by the summer,"
he said.
    Applebaum of Salomon Brothers also sees some seasonal
dropoff later in the year. "But there are more positives than
negatives," she said, citing reduced capacity in the domestic
industry, better prices, and a weaker dollar, which should
cause steel imports to drop off slightly from last year.

<TITLE>BRAZIL COTTON CROP LOWER -- USDA REPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil's 1986/87 cotton crop estimate
has been reduced to 710,000 from 735,000 tonnes (lint basis),
the U.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Sao Paulo said in
a field report.
    The report, dated April 7, said the reduction is based on
an expected smaller harvest in the center-south region.
    The center-south crop is now estimated at 550,000 tonnes --
25,000 tonnes below the previous estimate.
    Hot, dry weather during part of January and excessive rains
in some areas in February reduced yield prospects and may have
affected quality, the report said.
    Nearly 60 pct of the crop has been harvested in Parana and
slightly less in Sao Paulo, it said. Cotton entering gins is of
fairly good quality, according to trade sources, it said.

<TITLE>BRAZIL COCOA EXPORTERS UNLIKELY TO LIMIT SALES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, APRIL 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazilian cocoa exporters are not
likely to follow the example of Cocoa Producers Alliance, CPA,
members, who may limit sales of the product in an effort to
boost world prices, trade sources said.
    They said a similar procedure was taken in the past in
Brazil and that it did not work out according to plans.
    "The cocoa market is completely free. Unlike coffee, which
is controlled through export registrations, cocoa exporters in
Brazil operate at their own free will," a trade source said.
    The traders were responding to questions whether they would
follow the example of CPA members meeting in Yaounde.
    The sources said the Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade
Department, CACEX, never interferes in the cocoa market by
rejecting sales that do not meet certain price or shipment
criteria.
    "The position of local producers is always to negotiate as
they please. If they buy for ten and sell for eleven and think
it's a good deal, they are free to go ahead," one source added.

<TITLE>U.S. TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS RATE SHIFTS ORDERLY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker said
that changes in exchange rates have generally been orderly and
have improved the prospects for a reduction in external
imbalances to more sustainable levels.
    In remarks before the IMF's policy-making Interim
Committee, Baker reiterated a Group of Seven statement last
night that the substantial exchange rate changes since the
Plaza agreement 18 months ago have "now brought currencies
within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals."
    Baker said, "These exchange rate shifts have generally been
orderly, and have improved prospects for the reduction of
external imbalances to more sustainable levels."
    As they are today, the trade and current account imbalances
"simply are not sustainable," Baker told the ministers.
    He said that the Reagan administration was resisting "strong
domestic pressure" for trade protection and was working closely
with the U.S. Congress in crafting a trade bill.
    "While we cannot yet be sure of the outcome, we are doing
what we can to ensure that the bill is not protectionist," he
said.
    Baker also urged the International Monetary Fund's
executive board to review possible modifications to the Fund's
compensatory financing facility before the annual meeting this
fall.
    "We should pay particular attention to the lack of
continuing conditionality associated with the use of the CFF
and to whether shortfalls in export earnings are indeed
temporary," he said.

Beryl Sprinkel said the Reagan Administration remains strongly
opposed to a tax increase, including 18 billion dlrs of new
revenues in the budget plan by Congressional Democrats.
    "We believe that significant increases in taxes would not
reduce deficits and could have adverse effects on growth,"
Sprinkel told the House Rules Committee.
    He said the Administration wanted to continue its policy of
gradually reducing deficits through restraining government
spending and promoting economic growth. Sprinkel said cutting
the budget deficit was the best way to lower the trade deficit.

<TITLE>NATIONAL DISTILLERS &lt;DR> SEES SECOND QTR GAIN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>National Distillers and Chemical Corp
expects to realize a second quarter after-tax gain of four dlrs
per share from the 545 mln dlr sale of its spirits business to
American Brands Inc &lt;AMB>.
    National Distillers' stock rose 1-1/8 to 65-1/2, after an
opening delay on the New York Stock exchange for an imbalance
of orders.
    "I think the sales price was higher than most people
expected," said John Henry of E.F. Hutton Group.
    A company spokeswoman said the four dlr per share gain will
be included in second quarter net, which compares with 31 cts
per share last year, including the spirits and wine business
    "They netted over 700 mln dlrs for spirits and wine. That
will ease their interest cost burden," said Henry.
    National Distillers sold its wine business last month to
Grand Metropolitan PLC's Heublein Inc for 128 mln dlrs.
    Henry said he had anticipated National Distillers would net
only 600 mln dlrs at the most from the sale of the two liquor
businesses.
    Henry said the company recovered from the sales the cost of
buying Enron Chemicals in the fourth quarter last year.
National Distillers paid 570 mln dlrs cash for Enron and
assumed 34 mln dlrs in debt. National Distillers said at the
time it bought Enron it would sell the spirits and wine
businesses, moving more into the chemical area.
    For 1986, two thirds of income were from chemicals and
propane. National Distillers earned, excluding the liquor
businesses, 2.21 dlrs per share for 1986. Income from
discontinued operations, including the liquor businesses, was
67 cts per share.

<TITLE>BRAZIL SOYBEAN YIELDS SEEN AVERAGE - USDA REPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Based on field travel in the
Brazilian state of Parana, soybean yields should be about
average or 2.0 to 2.2 tonnes per hectare, the U.S. Agriculture
Department's officer in Sao Paulo said in a field report.
    The report, dated March 24, noted Parana accounts for about
20 to 24 pct of Brazil's total soybean crop.
    It said generally favorable weather from early December
through February helped compensate for earlier dryness.
    However, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 days
followed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the second
week of march has raised concern about late planted soybeans
which are still immature, but the impact may be localized, the
report said.
    The corn crop is expected to be a record and will create
serious storage problems, the report said.
    Due to favorable support prices, corn area increased by
more than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields are
expected to be above average, it said.
    Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn crop
crop has been harvested.
    During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grain
elevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn, the
report said.
    New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline  -- Parana
accounts for about 60 pct of total production. Major reasons
for the decline are expected reduced government support price
and good summer crop harvests.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Reserve was detected buying
dollars for yen in the open market as the dollar fell to a
40-year low of 144.60 yen in nervous late morning trading,
currency dealers said.
     They said the size of the intervention was relatively
modest so far but it was a clear indication that the U.S.
remained committed to the late February Paris currency
stabilization accord, which was reaffirmed in Washington last
night.
    A Fed spokeswoman had no comment on the dealer reports.
    The dollar hovered around 144.70 just before midday.

arriving at a system of target zones for currencies despite the

    He told reporters that "our ideas are progressing," adding

<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>No raw sugar is being unloaded at Tate
and Lyles refinery at Silvertown on the River Thames following
a fire yesterday afternoon, Tate and Lyle Plc said.
    The fire destroyed a large sector of the main conveyor from
the raw sugar jetty to the weighhouse.
    The company said it is not yet known how long the jetty
will be out of use but it hoped that by tomorrow unloading of
the bulk carrier Mykon Wave will be able to continue using
temporary arrangements, Tate and Lyle said.
    The Mykon Wave arrived in the port recently with about
18,300 tonnes of bulk sugar from Maputo in Swaziland. About
1,600 tonnes remain to be discharged.
    Five other ships loaded with raw sugar are awaiting at
Silvertown to be discharged, Tate and Lyle added.

<TITLE>MONSANTO &lt;MTC> UNIT SEES OPERATING LOSS IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Monsanto Corp's G.D. Searle and Co unit
said it will report an operating loss for 1987, mainly due to
expenses for research and development.
    Searle chairman Sheldon Gilgore said Searle's operating
loss in 1987 will be less than the 87 mln dlr operating loss in
1986.
    He said Searle's first quarter sales will be up 21.8 pct to
179 mln dlrs from 147 mln dlrs in the year ago quarter. In 1986
Searle's sales were 665 mln dlrs.
    Gilgore said the company intends to have sales of three
billion dlrs by the mid-1990s.
    He said the company anticipates approval in Japan, the
U.S., Italy, Spain and the U.K. for its ulcer treatment drug
Cytotech.
    He also said that in a paper not yet published the drug was
shown to prevent a flare-up of ulcers for a longer period of
time than Tagamet, made by SmithKline Beckman Corp &lt;SKB>.
    Other drugs in Searle's pipeline include tissue plasminogen
activator (TPA), made by a different process than Genentech's
&lt;GENE> TPA, expected to be approved for marketing this year.

    The company also said Santa Cruz has advised it that it
owns 24.7 pct of Foothill's outstanding common stock.
    In addition, Santa Cruz and Sierrita have agreed to vote
their shares in accordance with instructions from the Foothill
board in connection with certain business combinations and
certain anti-takeover matters, Foothill said.
    Foothill said the arrangement also bars Santa Cruz and
Sierrita fron tendering any Foothill securities owned by them
into any tender offer unless certain unspecified conditions are
met.

<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Commission was authorised
to buy up to one mln tonnes of maize into intervention stores
in the second half of June, although sales into intervention
normally end on April 30, Commission sources said.
    They said approval was given by the EC's Cereals Management
Committee because of the possible disturbance of the market due
to heavy imports of maize under the agreement between the EC
and the United States.
    The agreement guarantees access to the Spanish market for
two mln tonnes of non-EC maize a year for the next four years.
    The sources said the intervention price for the maize would
be 201.49 Ecus a tonne.
    They said at this price it seemed unlikely that the full
    They added the decision is also designed to prevent massive
offers of maize for intervention just ahead of the normal April
30 deadline, which could be caused by speculation about the
implementation of the accord with the United States.

<TITLE>SOUTHMARK &lt;SM> TO OFFER SPECIAL DIVIDEND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DALLAS, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Southmark Corp said it will issue its
shareholders a special dividend right to acquire 22 shares of
American Realty Trust &lt;ARB> for each 100 shares of Southmark
they own.
    Each right entitles the holder to buy one share of
beneficial interest of American Realty Trust at a price of 3.75
dlrs per share, Southmark said.
    Southmark said the offer's record date is May 1, with an
ex-dividend date of April 27, adding that the it will issue the
rights to shareholders on May 6 and the offer will expire on
May 22.
    Southmark said it received the rights on April 6 as the
holder of about 84 pct of American Realty Trust's outstanding
shares.
    Holders of fewer than 455 Southmark shares who would
receive rights to acquire fewer than 100 American Realty shares
will be paid cash in lieu of the rights distribution, the
company said.
    Southmark said it will compute the cash price paid based on
the average closing market price of the rights on the American
Stock Exchange for the first ten days the rights are traded,
beginning April 6.
    In order to get the dividend for these rights a Southmark
shareholder must own common stock on the ex-dividend date,
April 27, the company said.
    After that, Southmark said its common stock will be traded
on an ex-rights basis.

<TITLE>U.S. MARCH RETAIL SALES CUT BY LATE EASTER</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    BY Susan Zeidler, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. retailers' lackluster March sales
were due to a late Easter, according to analysts who expect a
recovery in April.
    "Sales look soft because of the Easter shift, but
underlying business is better than the numbers indicate," said
Bear Stearns analyst Monroe Greenstein.
     Analysts generally average the sales results of March and
April to account for the variation of Easter's occurance. This
year, Easter is being observed on April 19, which is three
weeks later than last year.
    Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said
sales for March rose an unadjusted 2.5 to 3.0 pct, and a
seasonally adjusted 5.5 pct to six pct, compared to an adjusted
5.7 pct last year.
    "The obvious question is whether these numbers indicate
that the consumer activity is slowing, but it does not appear
to be because liquidity and employment are rising," said
analyst Jeff Edelman, analyst of Drexel Lambert and Burnham.
    Overall, analysts said first half sales are coming in
according to expectations. Sales for all of 1987 are expected
to rise about 5.5 pct to six pct, up a bit from 1986's rise.
     In March, sales of housewares, furniture and big ticket
items were stronger than apparel sales, signaling to many
analysts that apparel sales will be strong in April as the
holiday nears.
    "Sales gains in home appliances and home fashions reflect a
continuing strength in the housing market," said Edward
Brennan, chairman of Sears Roebuck and Co &lt;S> which reported an
overall sales gain of 4.2 pct. Brennan said sales of women's
sportswear were also excellent.
    "Sears' total apparel sales was up only modestly, but even
a modest improvement in apparel is a very good accomplishment
due to the fact that most people will buy apparel in April,"
said C.J. Lawrence analysts Harry Mortner. 
    J.C. Penney Co Inc &lt;JCP> and Dayton Hudson Corp &lt;DH> were
among the weaker performers with comparable stores sales
declining 1.5 pct and 4.9 pct, respectively. Penney's store and
catalog sales declined 1.3 pct overall and Dayton Hudson's
overall sales rose 4.8 pct.
    Penney chairman William Howell said, "Sales continued
strong for catalog operations and, geographically, ranged from
very active in the east to weak in the economically depressed
southwest."
    "Penney's been shifting away from leisure time activity
wear to other apparel lines, which yield higher profit margins,
but are currently hurting sales," said Greenstein of Bear
Stearns.
    Hudson chairman Kenneth Mackes cited the late Easter for
the decline. Edelman of Drexel said that "Hudson had a tougher
comparison because it had an exceptionally good 1986."
    Most analysts agreed that promotions are slightly lower
than last year.
    "Retailers are not planning for much - inventories are
being kept lean, markdowns are lower than last year, but sales
are coming through anyway," said CJ Analyst Harry Mortner.
    Mortner said he expects profits in the first quarter to  
be better than he had originally expected in the beginning of
the year.
    Most retailers report their first quarter in the middle of
May.

<TITLE>LONDON EURODOLLAR BONDS CLOSE LOWER</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Norma Cohen, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Eurodollar bonds closed as much as a full
point lower as the dollar fell to a post-war low against the
yen and interest rates on U.S. Treasuries rose almost to eight
pct.
    The dollar fell to 144.30 yen and recovered only slightly
after foreign exchange traders in New York said the Federal
Reserve intervened to buy dollars for yen.
    But despite the dollar's woes, Japan Development Bank,
wholly owned by the Japanese government, raised 150 mln dlrs in
a seven-year eurobond carrying an eight pct coupon.
    Lead manager for the issue, Bank of Tokyo, said the deal,
at the time of pricing, was to yield 60 basis points over
comparable maturity Treasuries. However, by the close of
trading, that spread had narrowed to 55 and continued to slide
in aftermarket activity.
    Dealers noted that the spread to Treasuries is wide for a
newly-priced AAA-rated borrower like Japan Development Bank.
For example, earlier this week, the World Bank raised U.S. Dlrs
at only 25 basis points over Treasuries. Dealers said that
because the borrower comes to market fairly infrequently -- the
last time was about nine months ago, the spread appears wide.
    But officials at Bank of Tokyo said the spread is intended
to compensate for the lack of liquidity and for the uncertainty
currently associated with owning dollar securities.
    The officials said the borrower opted to raise funds in
dollars, despite the currency's weakness, because it is the
only market deep enough to accommodate an issue of that size.
Japan Development Bank is not allowed to raise euroyen.
    Market sources said the deal is likely to be swapped into
yen as the borrowers previous issues were.
    Late in the day, the deal was trading just inside its fees
at less 1.75 less 1.55.
    Also issued today was a 40 mln dlr five-year offering from
Toshiba International Finance (Netherlands) carrying a 7-3/8
pct coupon and priced at 101-1/2.
    Three equity linked dollar denominated deals were offered,
the largest of which was a 200 mln dlr offering by Sekisui
Chemical Co and guaranteed by Sanwa Bank Ltd. The issue has
equity warrants attached and late in the day it was quoted on
brokers' screens at 106-1/2, bid only.
    The Australian dollar market continued active, with
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce offering a bond of 125 mln
five-year with a zero coupon priced at 54.
    Late in the day, the deal was quoted at less 1-1/4 bid. A
similar deal yesterday by Toronto Dominion, priced slightly
higher at 54.37 pct for an effective yield of 13.52 pct, was
quoted slightly lower at less 1.37 less 1.25 pct.
    Dealers said that investors are apparently willing to
accept zero-coupon bonds yielding 50 to 100 basis points less
than annual-pay bonds because their are tax benefits for retail
buyers. Also, the bonds are more volatile and if interest rates
fall in Australia as many analysts expect, the potential for
capital gains is greater with a zero-coupon. The bonds are also
better for those who expect the australian dlr to appreciate.
    Dealers said that the Australia dlr zero coupon bonds are
apparently being placed with retail accounts on the European
continent with very little placement being done in Japan.
    Euroyen issues sank slightly in line with prices on
domestic Japanese bond markets but recovered in late trade as
the yen soared. After the markets closed, the dollar fell to
144 yen.
    The European Investment Bank (EIB) issued a 40 mln euroyen
issue paying 4-5/8 pct over seven years. This is the second
seven-year yen issue in two days -- a sector of the yield curve
in Japan that dealers feel has not yet become overpriced.

four dlr series, redeem certain outstanding long-term
indebtedness and repay outstanding short-term indebtedness.
    Fitchburg said this would lower its cost of capital in the

<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Northern Trust Corp said its first
quarter earnings were reduced by 875,000 dlrs by placing 53.2
mln dlrs of loans to Brazil and six mln dlrs in loans to
Ecuador on a cash basis.
    Should these loans remain on nonperforming basis for the
rest of 1987, net income for year will be cut by about 3.2 mln
dlrs, the bank said.
    Earlier it posted net income for the period of 14.7 mln
dlrs or 87 cts a share, up from 11.7 mln dlrs or 73 cts a
share.
    Total nonperforming assets were 114.1 mln dlrs at March 31,
up from 53.4 mln dlrs at December 31 and 79 mln dlrs at March
31, 1986 the bank said.
    The provision for loan losses for the first quarter was
eight mln dlrs compared to 11 mln a year ago. Net loan charge
offs were six mln dlrs, down from 11 mln dlrs a year ago.
    The reserve for loan losses was 78.1 mln dlrs, or two pct
of outstanding loans, higher than the 56 mln dlrs of 1.65 pct
of loans outstanding at March 31, 1986.

<TITLE>SWISS AGREE ON NEW PROSPECTUS RULES FOR NOTES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Conradi</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Swiss franc notes issued after May 1 must
be provided with a prospectus, virtually erasing the difference
in information requirements between notes and public bonds,
according to a convention drafted by the Bankers' Federation.
    The convention requires that lead managers draw up a
prospectus naming all syndicate members and providing certain
details about the borrower.
    In contrast to public issues, though, the prospectus must
merely be made available to clients on request via all
syndicate banks rather than published and distributed in
printed form.
    The convention, which was approved by banks earlier this
month, replaces an earlier convention dating from 1984 and
deals with what had been widely seen as an increasingly
anachronistic distinction between notes and public issues.
    Its publication follows a long debate among bankers on the
amount of information that should be provided by borrowers,
heightened by difficulties with Swiss franc issues here on
recent occasions .
    It applies to all notes in units of at least 50,000 Swiss
francs, the usual denomination, which are placed directly with
customers by the syndicate and not quoted on the bourse.
    Anything smaller than 50,000 francs will be governed by the
unchanged, more demanding rules that apply to public issues.
    Bankers contacted by Reuters said they did not envisage
that the new requirement would present them with problems or
push up fees. Many banks said that they had for some time been
providing more than the legal minimum of information.
    Traditionally, notes or private placements, as they were
also known, were medium term instruments denominated in 50,000
francs and placed largely with institutional investors.
    They were normally not brought onto the open market and
never quoted on the stock exchange.
    But over the years the distinction between notes and the
publicly quoted and traded bonds gradually broke down. The
National Bank therefore last May abolished all remaining
restrictions on maturities and denominations which still
formally divided them.
    However, it was not in the competence of the National Bank
to rule on prospectuses and banks have since continued largely
as before: public issues, generally quoted on stock exchanges,
have been provided with detailed prospectuses, while notes,
virtually always not-quoted, have been equipped only with
"information memorandums" with varying degrees of detail.
    The new convention attempts to put an end to this. It says
each notes prospectus must contain the following seven points:
    - The precise terms of the issue
    - Details of the company performance if it is more than six
months since the last annual report
    - Naming of all guarantors
    - The source of the information
    - Details of ratings, insofar as they have been made
    - For equity linked notes, details of where the company's
shares are listed and price high and lows over at least the
last three years.
    - That the lead manager has required the borrower to
provide information during the lifetime of the notes on the
progress of his business.
     According to figures from Swiss Bank Corp, total note
issues by foreign borrowers reached 18.6 billion Swiss francs
last year, compared with 23.6 billion francs borrowed in the
form of public bonds.
    A majority of the note issues were for Japanese borrowers.

measured on a cash basis, widened sharply to 134.9 billion
francs last year from 17.5 billion in 1985, the Finance
Ministry said.
    The increase was due almost entirely to a sharp rise in the
goods trade surplus to 126.1 billion francs from 20.4 billion.
    The services trade surpluses increased to 52.4 billion
francs from 38.9 billion while the deficit on transfers rose
slightly to 43.6 billion from 41.8 billion.
    Private sector capital operations showed a steeply higher
deficit of 160.7 billion francs after 56.9 billion in 1985.

<TITLE>DISEASE PUTS ZIMBABWE BEEF EXPORTS IN JEOPARDY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HARARE, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Zimbabwe's beef exports to the European
Community (EC), potentially worth 70 mln Zimbabwean dlrs this
year, may be jeopardised by an outbreak of foot and mouth
disease in southwestern Matabeleland, industry sources said.
    The country has temporarily suspended beef exports to the
EC because of the outbreak and awaits a decision from the EC
veterinary committee, which is considering a formal ban.
    The outbreak in the country's main ranching province has
already led neighbouring beef-producing Botswana and Zambia to
bar beef and dairy imports from Zimbabwe, threatening the dairy
industry with a loss of at least one mln dlrs in export
revenue.
    "The situation is still uncertain at the moment. Normally
when an outbreak occurs there is an automatic suspension of
beef exports," one industry source said yesterday.
     Commenting on EC policy, he explained, "Depending on the
seriousness of the outbreak the (veterinary) committee then
decides on three options, allowing us to continue exporting
beef from disease-free areas, clamping a three-month suspension
on exports or banning us from exporting for a year. We are
still awaiting their decision," he added, asking not to be
identified.
    Zimbabwe was granted an export quota of 8,100 tonnes of
high-grade beef to EC markets in 1985 after the country had
spent millions of dollars erecting disease-control fences and
upgrading abattoirs to meet stringent EC rules.
    Should the EC ban Zimbabwean exports, the country will be
forced to sell its beef on glutted world beef markets at low
prices, the source said. Projected earnings from beef sales
could fall about 23 mln dlrs as a result, he said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., introduced
in the House of Representatives legislation proposed by the
Reagan administration to slash the U.S. sugar price support, a
spokesman for Porter said.
    The spokesman said the bill was introduced without any
changes from the administration's proposal sent to Congress
last month.
    That plan calls for a cut in the sugar loan rate to 12
cents per pound from 18 cents now. Sugar growers would be
compensated for the price cut with targeted direct payments,
to be gradually phased-out through 1990. The payments to
growers would cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs.
    Representatives of sugar growers have rejected the
proposal, saying it would ruin the domestic sugar industry.

3,000 billion lire offer of short-term bills (BOTs) was mixed,
with six month paper oversubscribed but 12-month bills little
in demand, Bank of Italy figures show.
    Rates were unchanged on those indicated at the time the
offer was announced on April 4.
    The market was assigned all the 1,500 billion lire worth of
six-month bills on offer after requesting a total of 1,660
billion. Effective net annualized compound yield on the bills
is 9.19 pct, against 9.24 pct at the end-March auction.
    Of the 1,500 billion lire of 12-month paper offered,
operators requested and were assigned 911.975 billion lire at a
net annualized compound rate of 9.02 pct.
    The Bank of Italy took up the remaining 588.025 billion
lire of 12-month paper.
    The bills replace maturing paper worth 2,485 billion lire
of which 1,985 billion was in the hands of market operators and
the remainder with the Bank of Italy.

    UAL rose 1-5/8 to 73-5/8 on volume of more than two mln
shares, after trading with little upward movement earlier in
the session.
    Traders said rumors, which began yesterday, added to
speculation that the company would be the target of a takeover.
    They said it was believed Coniston Partners and the
Pritzker family of Chicago were buying the stock.
    Coniston declined comment and the Pritzkers had no comment.
    Traders said there was speculation a bidder might appear,
and also that real estate developer Donald Trump, who holds a
stake in UAL, might participate in a takeover bid. UAL pilots
said they would be willing to pay 4.5 billion dlrs, which
includes debt, for the company's United Airlines unit.

<TITLE>GREYCOAT GROUP SEEKS TWO FINANCINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.K. Property company Greycoat Group Plc
is seeking two financings, one for 120 mln stg and the other
for 16 mln stg, in connection with its Embankment Place
development above and around Charing Cross station in London,
banking sources said.
    The first transaction, a 120 mln stg credit, will be
arranged by N.M. Rothschild and Sons Ltd and Bank of Tokyo
International Ltd on behalf of a special purpose Greycoat
subsidiary yet to be incorporated.
    It matures in June 1993 but will be extendible by up to two
years to June 1995 at the option of the borrower.
    The first credit, a project financing, will carry a basic
margin of 5/8 point over London Interbank Offered Rates
(LIBOR), with an additional 1/4 pct per annum payable on
outstanding amounts to the extent that the property is not
substantially pre-let.
    In addition, if the property is pre-sold while amounts are
still outstanding, the basic margin will be reduced to 1/2
point over LIBOR, the banking sources said.
    For a one year extension of the maturity an extra 1/8 point
margin will be paid, with a further 1/8 point if the maturity
is lengthened for the optional second year.
    There will be a commitment fee of 1/4 pct per annum on
available amounts and of 1/8 pct on unavailable amounts, the
sources said. Rothschild is sole agent for this transaction.
    The second transaction, a 16 mln stg credit for the purpose
of working capital, is being arranged by Rothschild alone on
behalf of the Greycoat Group Plc itself. It will be secured on
a property called Brettenham House.
    The margin will be 1/2 point over LIBOR in years one to
four, 5/8 point over LIBOR in years five and six and 3/4 point
over LIBOR thereafter. The credit will mature in June, 1995.
    The sources said that a commitment fee of 20 basis points
will be payable on the available tranche, with 10 basis points
on unavailable amounts.

<TITLE>CONSENSUS SEEN ON TIN PACT EXTENSION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The quarterly session of the
International Tin Council (ITC) continued without formal
agreement on an extension of the sixth International Tin
Agreement (ITA), but delegates said it was apparent there was a
general consensus the Agreement should be prolonged.
    Some delegations are still awaiting formal instructions
from capitals, but informally most have indicated they favour
an extension, delegates said.
    This afternoon's session was used by delegates to seek
further clarification on some of the issues involved, and to
discuss internal matters.
    Some sources were optimistic a resolution on an extension
could be passed tomorrow but others suggested a special session
would be convened to adopt the resolution after the Association
of Tin Producing Countries meeting April 14 to 16.
    The full Council session resumes tomorrow at 1330 GMT after
a European Community coordination meeting at 1100.

<TITLE>IRT PROPERTY LAUNCHES DEBENTURE IN EUROMARKET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>IRT Property Co, a real estate investment
trust based in Atlanta, Georgia, has launched a 30 mln dlr
convertible subordinated debenture in the Euromarket, a partner
of Chandler Partnership Ltd said.
    The issue is unique in several respects and is only one of
a handful of such deals to be brought to this market, he said.
    Unlike most eurobonds, the issue will not be underwritten.
Instead, IRT mandated Chandler Partnership to find potential
investors with whom the issue can be preplaced and to then
place on a "best efforts" basis what ever amount may not be
subscribed.
    Chandler itself was set up in the Isle of Jersey in the
middle of last year as a partnership, whose members have been
involved in financial markets.
    The deal has two sponsors who assist in the placement--
Interallianz Bank Zurich AG and Nivison Cantrade Ltd, a small
U.K. Trading firm that formerly was broker R. Nivison and Co.
    The debentures are due June 1, 2002 and pay a semi-annual
coupon of two pct and are priced at par. They can be converted
into shares of the company's stock at 23-1/2 dlrs a share.
    IRT's shares closed last night on the New York Stock
Exchange at 19-7/8.
    The debentures can be redeemed at par at maturity and are
callable at the company's option after the first two years.
    On or after August 1989 the company can call half the
debentures if the stock trades for 30 days at 123 pct of the
conversion price and half if it reaches 140 pct of the
conversion price, Nivison said.
    In addition, holders will be able to surrender half the
bonds during May 1991 at 123 pct for a semi-annual yield of
7.043 pct and the other half in May 1993 at 140 pct, for a
yield of 7.383 pct.
    The payment date is June 1, 1987. The debentures will be
listed in London and the fees for the deal total 2-1/4 pct.
    Nivison said that the deal contains a convenent which
states that if the company's debt to equity ratio exceeds two
to one the debentures cannot be converted unless the company
obtains a bank guarantee or a letter of credit.
    Nivison said IRT's debt to equity ratio currently is less
than one to one.
    The Chandler partner said that this type of deal gives the
borrower funds that are less costly than if it had done an
issue in the U.S. Domestic market.

trade and Egyptian official sources said.
    Trade sources said the cancellation followed an offer by an
Egyptian company, Islamic Corp, at 85.80 dlrs/tonne cost and
freight, undercutting other traders' offers of between 93.90
and 94.49 dlrs/tonne.
    An Egyptian trade official in Paris confirmed cancellation
of the tender following the Islamic Corp offer, which he said
the government had refused for legal reasons.
    The official denied trade reports that the government might
have substituted a private deal with Islamic Corp for the
original tender.

<TITLE>HOUSE PANEL WANTS PENTAGON MANAGE U.S. STOCKPILE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The House Armed Services Committee
has voted for a transfer in the management of stockpiled
materials for national defense to the U.S. Defense Secretary.
    The committee also voted for legally-binding quantity and
quality requirements on the materials, mostly metals.
    The measures are a part of the Defense Authorization Bill
which will be voted on in the House next month.
    The purpose of the measures, passed by the committee
yesterday, is to improve stockpile management and discourage
sell-offs of materials that could jeopardize strategic needs, a
staff member of the committee told Reuters.
    "They (the stockpiles) stand to gain the most by being
managed properly," said the staffer. "Management of the stockpile
over the last 10 years has been atrocious."
    Responsibility for stockpile management now belongs to a
White House agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
    The staffer said under the measures passed by the committee
the Secretary of Defense would have more influence over
decisions to keep or sell strategic stockpile materials.
    The administration has proposed a goal of 700 million dlrs
worth of strategic materials to be held in the stockpile. The
stockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials.
    He said several agencies currently helped FEMA to manage
the stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit.
    These agencies included the Office of Management and Budget

<TITLE>CANADA TRADE RISE SEEN AS START OF RECOVERY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Russell Blinch, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canada's trade picture has brightened
considerably, underscoring economists' predictions the sector
would post a long awaited recovery this year.
    The federal government reported today that the monthly
surplus soared to 1.25 billion Canadian dlrs in February,
double January's 623 mln dlrs surplus and sharply higher than
February 1986's 189 mln dlr tally.
    "Hopefully it's the beginning of a trend," said Richardson
Greenshields of Canada Ltd economist Susan Clark in Toronto.
    Economists generally don't expect such large gains over the
next months, but are looking for an upward trend throughout the
year.
    "We thought the trade balance would improve ... over the
year, and it certainly looks as if this morning's figure is
indicative of that," commented economist James Donegan at the
Toronto securities firm of Midland Doherty Ltd.
    Statistics Canada reported the surplus was driven by a 23
pct gain in automobile product exports to a record 3.2 billion
dls in the month.
    "Recovery in the automotive sector helped push the value of
exports up by 5.9 pct in February," the agency said in its
monthly report.
    Total exports expanded to 10.44 billion dlrs from 9.85
billion dlrs in February, while imports slipped to 9.19 billion
dlrs from 9.23 billion dlrs.
    Economists have predicted the 1987 trade surplus would end
up three to five billion dlrs higher than last year's dismal
10.1 billion dlr total. In 1985 the surplus was 17.48 billion
dlrs.
    Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched
off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85
U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after
closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.
    The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early
afternoon trading.
    Economists have been banking on an improved trade
performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish
Canadian economy.
    Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched
off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85
U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after
closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.
    The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early
afternoon trading.
    Economists have been banking on an improved trade
performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish
Canadian economy.
    They say the country's consumers, who have been spending at
a torrid pace in recent years, will sharply curtail outlays
this year and this should help curtail the flow of imports into
the country.
    Meanwhile, demand for Canadian exports in the United
States, by far the country's largest market, is expected to be
strong as a result of a projected rise in American consumer
spending and the relatively low value of the Canadian currency.
    "We maintain what's going to drive Canada's export
performance is income growth in the U.S.," said Midland's
Donegan.
    But at the Bank of Nova Scotia, deputy chief economist
Warren Jestin was less optimistic about the U.S. outlook and
said it could be a mistake to read too much into February's
trade upturn.
    Jestin said, "Given the fact the U.S. economy is showing
signs of weakening--particularly car sales--it would indicate
that part of the strength (in Canada's trade figures) is
probably transitory."

<TITLE>FIRST BANK &lt;FBS> SEES LOSS ON BRAZILIAN LOANS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MINNEAPOLIS, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>First Bank Systems Inc, in reporting
higher first quarter net, said that if interest is not paid on
the 140 mln dlrs in Brazilian loans and nine mln dlrs in
Ecuadorian loans for the rest of 1987, its profits for the
entire year will be cut by 6.9 mln dlrs.
    The banking firm said the non-performing status of these
loans cut first quarter net by 1.7 mln dlrs.
    Earlier it reported first quarter profits of 57.4 mln dlrs
or 95 cts a share, up from 46.6 mln dlrs or 80 cts a share in
the year-ago period.
    Nonaccrual loans, restructured loans and other real estate
were 637 mln dlrs, or 2.24 pct of total assets, compared to 514
mln dlrs or 1.84 pct of assets at the end of 1986 and 636.1
mln, or 2.46 pct of assets at March 31, 1986.
    The provision for loan losses in the quarter was 35 mln
dlrs, compared to 152.1 mln in the first quarter 1986, when
there was a special addition to the reserve of 100 mln dlrs.
Net charge offs were 34.7 mln, compared to 41.1 mln dlrs a year
earlier.

<TITLE>CLEVITE &lt;CLEV> AMENDS RIGHTS PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GLENVIEW, ILL., April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Clevite Industries Inc, which
earlier received a 96 mln dlr takeover offer from J.P.
Industries Inc &lt;JPI>, said it amended its Shareholder Rights
Plan so that certain provisions of the plan cannot occur until
the board determines that it is in the best interests of the
company and stockholders.
    The plan, adopted in December 1986, permits Clevite to
issue shares at half price to existing stockholders and allows
stockholders to buy shares of an unfriendly bidder at half
price.
    Clevite said the amendments by its board effectively mean
that the so-called flip-in and flip-over provisions of its
rights plan can only be triggered by affirmative board
approval.
    The company said it acted inview of the proposed
acquisition and because certain debt restrictions could block
its ability to redeem the rights.

unlikely that all reported quantities will be exported.
    USDA gave detailed breakdowns for the 1986/87 and 1987/88
seasons as follows, in thousand tonnes unless stated --
 (A) - Firm sales to a declared destination.
 (B) - Ultimate destination not yet declared.
 (C) - Sales made on exporters' own account.
 (D) - Exporter holds option to fill commitment with supplies 
from origins other than U.S.
 (E) - Accumulated exports since season began based on data 
reported by exporters.
 (F) - Indicated total for season.
 (G) - USDA-projected exports for season.

<TITLE>HOUSE PANEL WANTS PENTAGON MANAGE U.S. STOCKPILE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The House Armed Services Committee
has voted for a transfer in the management of stockpiled
materials for national defense to the U.S. Defense Secretary.
    The committee also voted for legally-binding quantity and
quality requirements on the materials, mostly metals.
    The measures are a part of the Defense Authorization Bill
which will be voted on in the House next month.
    The purpose of the measures, passed by the committee
yesterday, is to improve stockpile management and discourage
sell-offs of materials that could jeopardize strategic needs, a
staff member of the committee told Reuters.
    "They (the stockpiles) stand to gain the most by being
managed properly," said the staffer. "Management of the stockpile
over the last 10 years has been atrocious."
    Responsibility for stockpile management now belongs to a
White House agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
    The staffer said that under the measures passed by the
committee the Secretary of Defense would have more influence
over decisions to keep or sell strategic stockpile materials.
    The administration has proposed a goal of 700 million dlrs
worth of strategic materials to be held in the stockpile. The
stockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials.
    He said several agencies currently helped FEMA to manage
the stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit.
    These agencies included the Office of Management and Budget
and the Departments of Interior and Commerce, he said.
    The committee believed the shared involvement in stockpile
management was counter-productive, he said.

<TITLE>SOVIET UNION TO IMPORT MORE GRAIN IN 86/87-USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Agriculture Department
increased its estimate of 1986/87 grain purchases by the Soviet
Union to 28 mln tonnes, up two mln tonnes from last month.
    In its monthly report on the Soviet grain situation, the
USDA said imports will be higher than earlier estimated because
Soviet grain buyers have been actively purchasing in the last
month.
    USDA said the increased purchasing is "somewhat surprising"
because of recent higher Soviet crop estimates.
    All of the increase in estimated imports will be in corn,
USDA said.
    Of the 28 mln tonnes total, 15 mln tonnes will be wheat, 12
mln tonnes coarse grains, and the remaining one mln tonnes
miscellaneous grains and pulses, USDA said.
    USDA noted that the Soviet winter grain crop suffered
through a severe winter and spring field work has been delayed.
    The severe winter "is believed to have resulted in above
average winter-kill," USDA said.
    Some grain trade analysts have said abnormal winter losses
maybe one reason why the Soviet Union has been actively buying
grain recently.
    USDA said Moscow already has purchased over 25 mln tonnes
grain for delivery in 1986/87, including 14 mln tonnes wheat
and 12 mln tonnes coarse grain.

<TITLE>DISNEY FAMILY MAKES BID FOR HOLLY SUGAR &lt;HLY></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Roy Disney family disclosed in a
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it made
a bid to acquire Holly Sugar Corp for a package of cash and
securities.
    Shamrock Holdings of California Inc, a Disney family
company, said it submitted the bid on April 8 to Salomon
Brothers Inc, Holly Sugar's investment banker.
    The offer was for 45 dlrs in cash, securities with a face
value of 70 dlrs, and a "contingent payment certificate" that
would pay out as much as 70 dlrs over a 20-year period for each
share of Holly Sugar outstanding.
    The Disney family already holds 101,300 Holly Sugar shares
or 9.0 pct of the total outstanding following purchases of
12,500 shares March 13-April 17, Shamrock told the SEC.
    Shamrock said it had asked for certain information about
Holly Sugar's financial condition but had been turned down. It
said its offer was therefore subject to further discussions.
    "Once we have had an opportunity to complete our due
diligence evaluation of the company, including inspections of
certain facilities and meetings with key management personnel,
we would be prepared to negotiate all aspects of our proposal,
including price," it said in its April 8 letter.

Morita said Sony's profits would be sharply down in 1987 as a
result of the dollar's decline.
    Sony Corp posted net consolidated income of 41.89 billion
yen (290 million dollars) in 1986, 42.6 pct down on 1985's
73.02 billion yen (506 million dollars).

yen by saving on its energy import bill and he expected profits
to recover from 1988 onwards.

<DATELINE>    New York, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Agriculture Department's
latest estimates on 1986/87 Florida orange production and
orange juice yield are bearish for the frozen concentrated
orange juice futures market because the yield increase was
greater than expected, FCOJ traders and analysts said.
    The USDA projected an average yield of 1.50 gallons of FCOJ
per box versus last month's estimate of 1.47 gallons.
    The government estimated Florida orange production
(excluding Temples) at 122.9 mln boxes versus 124 mln last
month. Temples were unchanged at 3.4 mln boxes.
    Traders and analysts said the unexpectedly large yield
increase outweighed the anticipated drop in box count.

<TITLE>NORANDA BEGINS SALVAGE OPERATIONS AT MURDOCHVILLE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     Toronto, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Noranda Inc> said it began salvage
operations at its Murdochville, Quebec, mine, where a fire last
week killed one miner and caused 10 mln dlrs in damage.
     Another 56 miners were trapped underground for as long as
24 hours before they were brought to safety.
    Noranda said the cause and full extent of the damage is
still unknown but said it does know that the fire destroyed
6,000 feet of conveyor belt.
     Noranda said work crews have begun securing the ramp
leading into the zone where the fire was located. The company
said extreme heat from the fire caused severe rock degradation
along several ramps and drifts in the mine.
     Noranda estimated that the securing operation for the zone
will not be completed before the end of April.
    Noranda said the Quebec Health and Safety Commission, the
Quebec Provincial Police and Noranda itself are each conducting
an investigation into the fire.
    Production at the mine has been suspended until the
investigations are complete. The copper mine and smelter
produced 72,000 tons of copper anodes in 1986 and employs 680
people.
     The smelter continues to operate with available
concentrate from stockpiled supplies, Noranda said. Reuter

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>U.S. OIL DEPENDENCY SEEN RISING TO RECORD LEVEL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAN FRANCISCO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States' dependency on
foreign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid-1990s,
according to John H. Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry
Research Associates.
    Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conference
here, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as much
as 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous high
level of 47 pct in 1977.
    "The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil is
inevitable," Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oil
imports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said.
    Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for
33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to
40 pct by 1990.
    "However, the rate of this growth can be affected
positively or negatively through government action or
inaction," Lichtblau said.
    He said that one of the government's negative actions is
the maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as a
disincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cash
flow for oil exploration.
    Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floor
price for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices.
    "An international floor price adopted by all or most
industrial countries would clearly be a much more effective
measure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than if
we imposed it alone," Lichtblau said.
    Development of alternate energy sources such as synthetic
fuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessen
U.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said.
    A potential for alternative supplies could limit the
willingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said.
    Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offer
tax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plans
for alternative energy.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Treasury said its auction of
9.76 billion dlrs of 52-week bills produced an average rate of
5.92 pct.
    The rate was up from 5.68 pct at the last auction of
one-year bills on March 12.
    At today's sale, the bond-equivalent yield was 6.30 pct. 
Accepted bids ranged from 5.88 pct to 5.93 pct and 80 pct of
bids at the high, or stopout, rate were taken.
    The Treasury received 26.7 billion dlrs of bids, including
554 mln dlrs in non-competitive bids from the public.
    The average price of the one-year bills was 94.014 and the
range was 94.055 to 94.004.
    The average rate of 5.92 pct was the highest since 5.98 pct
on July 8, 1986.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Fundamental Brokers Institutional
Associates, a leading inter-dealer broker in U.S. government
securities, said it has agreed to acquire certain assets of MKI
Government Brokers Inc for undisclosed terms.
    Acquisition documents have been signed and are being held
in escrow pending the receipt of certain consents, it said.
    In conjunction with the sale of assets, MKI has ceased
brokering treasury bills, notes and bonds, Fundamental said.
    Industry sources told Reuters yesterday that Fundamental
was close to acquiring the government securities brokerage
division of MKI, a major broker of corporate bonds.
    Fundamental said it intends to use the facilities formerly
used by MKI to provide a new block brokering service in the
most active Treasury issues.
    By separating the execution of wholesale trades from the
heavy volume of smaller lots, large-scale transactions will be
facilitated, the company said.
    "The new system is expected to substantially enhance the
liquidity and effiency of markets," Fundamental said.
    The wholesale brokering service will begin on or around
April 20.

<TITLE>USDA COMMENTS ON EXPORT SALES REPORT </TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. corn sales of just over 1.0 mln
tonnes in the week ended April 2 were eight pct above the prior
week, but 25 pct below the four-week average, the U.S.
Agriculture Department said.
    In comments on its latest Export Sales Report, the
department said Iraq, Japan and the USSR were the largest
buyers.
    Sales for the next marketing year, which begins September
1, totaled 503,200 tonnes and were mainly to Iraq and Taiwan.
    Wheat sales of 119,300 tonnes for the current season and
net reductions of 13,700 tonnes for the 1987/88 season were
four-fifths below the combined total for the prior week and the
four-week average, it said.
    Sri Lanka was the most active wheat destination with
purchases of 52,500 tonnes for the current year, it said.
    Other significant purchasers for the current year were
Mexico and Honduras, it said.
    Soybean sales of 240,500 tonnes were one-fifth below the
prior week and nearly one-third below the four-week average.
    Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Italy and Israel were the major
purchasers, the department said.
    Net sales of 117,700 tonnes of soybean cake and meal fell
31 pct from the previous week and 38 pct below the four-week
average. Major increases for West Germany, Venezuela, the
Netherlands and Saudi Arabia were partially offset by
reductions for unknown destinations, USDA said.
    Activity in soybean oil resulted in decreases of 2,400
tonnes, with sales to unknown destinations down by 2,700
tonnes, while sales to Canada increased 200 tonnes, the
Department said.
    Combined sales of 71,300 running bales of cotton -- 60,200
bales for the current season and 11,100 bales for 1987/88
season -- were four-fifths higher than the prior week's level
but nine pct below the four-week average.
    Mexico was the dominant buyer for the current year followed
by Zaire, Italy, and Spain, the department said.
The primary buyers for the 1987/88 season were South Korea,
Spain, Japan and Taiwan, the department said.
    Sorghum sales of 143,300 tonnes were 25 pct less than the
prior week, with Japan and Venezuela the main buyers.

Douglas Danforth said he was encouraged by first quarter
results for fiscal 1987, and said the company was positioned to
capitalize on the economy's modest growth for the rest of the
year.
    "I am encouraged by the continuing improvement in
earnings," Danworth said. "The first quarter met our
expectations."
    Westinghouse recorded net income for the first quarter of
151.6 mln dlrs, or 1.05 dlrs per share, on revenues of 2.32
billion dlrs.
    Danworth attributed the results to an increase in the
operating profit in the energy and advanced technology,
industries and commerical segments.

<TITLE>U.S. BANK DISCOUNT BORROWINGS 361 MLN DLRS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. bank discount window borrowings
less extended credits averaged 361 mln dlrs a day in the week
to Wednesday, April 8, the Federal Reserve said.
    Total daily borrowings in the week fell 99 mln dlrs to 591
mln dlrs, with extended credits down 35 mln dlrs at 230 mln
dlrs. The week was the second half of the two-week statement
period that ended Wednesday. Net borrowings averaged 425 mln
dlrs in the first week of the period.
    Commenting on the two-week statement period that ended on
April 8, the Fed said banks had average net free reserves of
447 mln dlrs.
    A Fed spokesman told a press conference that there were no
large one-day net misses in the Fed's estimates of reserves in
the week ended Wednesday.
    Of the week's borrowings, money center banks accounted for
65 pct, and small banks for almost 35 pct. On Wednesday, when
net borrowings were 1.36 billion dlrs and Fed funds averaged a
high 6.45 pct, money center banks accounted for more than 90
pct of the borrowing.
    Borrowings in the latest two weeks averaged 393 mln dlrs a
day, the highest since the statement period ended January 28.
    Float ranged from about 250 mln dlrs on Thursday to between
one and 1.25 billion dlrs on Monday and Tuesday.
    The spokesman said Monday's float included 500 mln dlrs in
holdover float at one Fed branch due to mechanical problems.
    About 500 mln dlrs of Tuesday's float reflected
non-weather-related transportation float in one Eastern Reserve
bank.
    As-of adjustments ranged from minus 500 mln dlrs on Monday,
when cash letter errors at two eastern reserve banks were
corrected, to plus 500 mln dlrs on Thursday, when a correction
was made to unposted funds at a single bank.
    In the first half of the statement period ended Wednesday,
banks held excess reserves on the first four days of the week
but ran a deficit on Wednesday.
    In the second week, they ran a deficit on Thursday, Friday
and Monday but held excess reserves on the final two days.

<TITLE>NORANDA BEGINS MURDOCHVILLE MINE SALVAGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     TORONTO, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Noranda Inc said it began salvage
operations at its Murdochville, Quebec mine where a fire last
week killed one miner and caused 10 mln dlrs in damage.
     Noranda said the cause and full extent of the damage is
still unknown but the fire destroyed 6,000 feet of conveyor
belt.
    The company said extreme heat from the fire caused severe
rock degradation along several ramps and drifts in the mine.
    Production at the mine has been suspended until
investigations are complete. The copper mine and smelter
produced 72,000 tons of copper anodes in 1986.
     The smelter continues to operate with available
concentrate from stockpiled supplies, Noranda said.

<TITLE>IF DOLLAR FOLLOWS WALL STREET JAPANESE WILL DIVEST</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Yoshiko Mori</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>If the dollar goes the way of Wall Street,
Japanese will finally move out of dollar investments in a
serious way, Japan investment managers say.
    The Japanese, the dominant foreign investors in U.S. Dollar
securities, have already sold U.S. Equities.
    But "if the dollar falls steeply, which did not happen
yesterday, Japanese investors will definitely try to withdraw
significant funds from U.S. Shares," said Akira Kawakami, deputy
manager of Nomura Investment Trust and Management Co Ltd's
international investment department.
    An unstable, lower dollar would also affect Japanese
investment in U.S. Bonds. "Japan-U.S. Interest rate
differentials, which currently look wide enough, mean nothing
in the absence of dollar stability," said Kawakami.
    U.S. Bonds could benefit due to a gloomy economic picture
following the estimated huge losses in stocks by major U.S.
Institutional and individual investors, he said. The effect
should be to rule out any U.S. Interest rate rise.
    But most Japanese investors in U.S. Bonds are still wiating
to see if the dollar really is stable, he said. The dollar was
holding firm at above 142 yen on Tuesday morning.
    "Although Japanese investors sold huge amounts of stocks in
New York yesterday, most are still looking for chances to
lighten their U.S. Stock inventories," Hiromitsu Sunada, manager
of Meiji Mutual Life Insurance Co's international investment
department said.
    Their sales helped send Wall Street stocks down 508 points
to 1,738, the market's biggest percentage drop since 1914.
    "Investment in U.S. Stocks and bonds is difficult,
considering the dangers," said Katsuhiko Okiyama, deputy general
manager and chief adviser of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's fixed
income securities marketing group.
    Japanese investment at home could start to pick up once
markets have stopped reacting to Wall Street, the managers
said. The Tokyo yen bond market is likely to stabilise in one
or two weeks, which is what investors have been waiting for.
The bottom for yen bonds should be around a 6.3 pct yield for
the 5.1 pct 89th bond, they said.
    "The basic background which has supported the stocks and
bonds markets has not changed," said Norio Okutsu, assistant
general manager of Nikko Securities' bond department. "But new
outflows of funds to the U.S. Will be decreasing."  However,
this was already evident three months ago, he said.

<TITLE>ASIAN COCOA PRODUCERS EXPAND DESPITE CRITICS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jeremy Clift</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Asian cocoa producers are expanding
output despite depressed world prices and they dismiss
suggestions in the London market that their cocoa is inferior.
    "Leading cocoa producers are trying to protect their market
from our product," said a spokesman for Indonesia's directorate
general of plantations. "We're happy about our long-term future."
    Malaysian growers said they would try to expand sales in
Asia and the United States if Malaysian cocoa was not suitable
for European tastes.
    They were responding to comments by London traders that
large tonnages of unwanted cocoa beans from Malaysia, Indonesia
and Papua New Guinea (PNG) were helping to depress cocoa
prices.
    London traders said the Asian cocoa was considered
unsuitable for western palates because of an acrid odour and a
high level of free fatty acids.
    Ng Siew Kee, the chairman of Malaysia's Cocoa Growers'
Council, said Malaysia should expand its sales to Asia and the
United States if it did not produce a type suitable for Western
Europe.
    A spokesman for the PNG Cocoa Industry Board said the
London market was mistaken if it linked PNG cocoa with
high-acid Malaysian and Indonesian beans.
    "When the market is declining, buyers seize on anything to
talk down prices," the spokesman said.
    He said that PNG could sell whatever cocoa it produces.
    PNG exported 33,000 tonnes of cocoa in the 1986/87 cocoa
year ending September 30, of which nearly 50 pct was exported
to West Germany, 16 pct to the U.S. And the rest to the
Netherlands and Britain.
    The Indonesia spokesman, an Agriculture Ministry official
who wished not to be identified, said Indonesia had no problem
with quality and would continue to expand sales. He described
criticism of the quality of Indonesian beans as "trade politics"
and said Jakarta's traditional links with Dutch buyers meant it
did not have any difficulty with exports.
    Indonesia and Malaysia, Asia's two biggest commodity
producers, are expanding cocoa output and are both outside the
International Cocoa Organization (ICCO).
    Officials have said Malaysian production is expected to
total 150,000 to 155,000 tonnes in calendar 1987.
    This is up from 131,000 tonnes in 1986, partly because of
the end of a three-year drought in Sabah, the country's largest
cocoa growing area.
    Production of Indonesian cocoa beans tripled to 31,600
tonnes in calendar 1986 from 10,284 tonnes in 1980. Output is
projected to rise to 50,000 tonnes in 1988 from 38,000 tonnes
this year as young trees mature.
    Both Malaysia and Indonesia are low cost producers and
traders said they could last out low prices longer than West
African countries.
    According to one Kuala Lumpur trader, world prices would
have to fall another 1,000 ringgit per tonne (about 250 stg) to
make cocoa production in Malaysia uneconomic.
    Some traders believe the main quality problem is with
harvesting and fermentation techniques.
    One trader said Malaysian cocoa is virtually
indistinguishable from West African output if treated in the
same way but this is not possible on the larger Malaysian
estates.

<TITLE>MALAYSIA ADVISED TO RAISE CRUDE OIL OUTPUT IN 1988</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Malaysia's national oil company,
Petronas, has advised the government to raise crude oil output
to 540,000 barrels a day (bpd) in 1988 from a current 500,000
bpd, a senior company official said.
    "We have the capacity to produce the amount," Rastam Hadi,
Petronas's Vice-President for Upstream Sector said.
    The government will announce its decision on Friday when it
unveils the country's budget. Malaysia raised output this month
to current levels from 420,000 bpd after reviewing the world
oil market. In May, Malaysia cut output to 420,000 bpd from
459,000 in response to a call by OPEC to boost prices.

he welcomed Monday's U.S. And West German joint confirmation of
their commitment to the Louvre accord.
    Sumita said in a statement that world stockmarkets were
excessively concerned about the economic future.
    The Bank of Japan will continue to adhere to a system of
policy coordination based upon the Louvre accord of February,
he said. The accord called for stability in foreign exchange
rates. Exchange rates generally are regaining stability and the
economies of industrialised nations are heading for a steady
recovery, he said.

<TITLE>NEW ZEALAND WILL CONTINUE FIRM MONETARY POLICY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Reserve Bank of New Zealand said
there was no evidence to suggest the fall in share prices had
affected financial stability and it would maintain its firm
monetary policy.
    Governor Spencer Russell said in a statement the central
bank did not accept arguments that the battle against inflation
should now take a low second priority after the sharemarket's
plunge.
    Russell said the bank had two statutory responsibilities --
to implement the government's monetary policy to bring down
inflation, and to ensure the financial sector's stability.
    "Unless the bank is directed otherwise, the firm monetary
policy will continue because it is very much in the national
interest that it do so," he said.
    "And there is yet no evidence available to the bank to
suggest that the fall in share prices has affected the
stability of the financial sector."
    The Barclays share index fell a record 504.75 points to
2,925,26 on Tuesday, a decline of 14.7 pct.

    The cotton, worth one billion shillings, cannot be moved to

Many mills are not working because of a lack of spare parts, it
added.

<TITLE>AQUINO SAYS MANILA WATCHING INTEREST RATES CLOSELY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Corazon Aquino said the
Philippines was closely monitoring interest rates in the wake
of Monday's record drop on Wall Street and steep declines in
Manila and other Asian stock markets.
    "We will monitor these developments closely and will
continue to hope that they do not precipitate large declines in
economic activity around the world," Aquino told a meeting of 13
major Philippine business groups.
    "The Philippines, as a trading country in the world economy,
depends on the continued health and growth of both the world
economy and the world trading system," she said.
    The Manila Stock Exchange composite index plunged 105.49
points or 11.79 pct by the midday close to 789.54, depressed by
the record 508 point fall of the Dow Jones industrial average
on Monday.
    "The Philippines, in addition, as a large borrower nation,
is affected by developments in interest rate levels around the
world and will carefully monitor the impact of these
developments on interest rates, on gold and on commodity
prices," Aquino said.
    "We welcome the statements from world leaders that urge calm
in the present difficult situation," she added.

the rate of increase was 11.0 pct.

<TITLE>WORLD COULD COPE WITH HORMUZ CLOSURE, SUBROTO SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Oil prices would skyrocket for a time if
conflict in the Gulf closed the Strait of Hormuz, but oil
supplies could be adjusted to take care of world demand,
Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said.
    He made no explicit reference to the latest U.S. Military
action in the Gulf.
    But in an address to a conference of the Indonesian
Petroleum Association, he said, "If worst comes to worst and say
the flow of oil through the Straits of Hormuz is completely
shut off, I believe the world oil supply, given time to adjust,
can take care of the situation."
    "But this is not to say that prices, at least for a short
duration, will not skyrocket as speculators take advantage of
the situation," he declared.
    Tensions in the Gulf, however, usually had a relatively
short-term impact on prices, he added.
    Assessing future price trends, he said, "Short-term spot
prices will probably still fluctuate, but they will most likely
hover around the official Opec price basket of 18 dlrs per
barrel.
    "The upward deviations, however, are likely to be greater
than the downward ones."
    "The balance between supply and demand in the short term
will still be delicate," he added. "Non-Opec production may still
go up, competing with Opec for the expected additional increase
in world demand."
    Subroto, a member of Opec's three-man quota committee which
has been touring cartel members, said speculation may play
havoc with spot prices, but Opec was trying to stabilize the
situation by urging cooperation by non-Opec producers.
    In the medium term, non-Opec production would reach a
plateau in the early 1990s, leaving Opec much stronger, he
said.

<TITLE>POEHL SAYS RATE RISES ARE CAUSE FOR CONCERN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Rises in West German and international
interest rates are a cause for concern and the Bundesbank has
no interest in higher capital market rates, Bundesbank
President Karl Otto Poehl said.
    "We consider the interest rate increase that has occurred
here and internationally to be a problem and cause for concern,"
Poehl told an investment conference.
    "I would like to stress that the Bundesbank has no interest
in higher capital market rates," he said.
    Shortly after Poehl spoke, the Bundesbank announced a
tender for a securities repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80
pct.
    Previous tenders over the last month by interest rate have
seen the allocation rate on these facilities rise to 3.85 pct
at last week's pact from 3.60 on the last fixed-rate tender in
late September.
    The Bundesbank's reduction of the key allocation rate to
3.80 from 3.85 pct was heralded Monday by repeated injections
of money market liquidity at between 3.70 and 3.80 pct.
    These moves to cap interest rates followed a meeting
between Poehl, Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.
Treasury Secretary James Baker Monday in Frankfurt.
    Officials said afterwards the three men had reaffirmed
their commitment to the Louvre accord on currency stability.
    Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of the tightening in
West German monetary policy had prompted a sharp fall of the
dollar on speculation that Louvre cooperation had ended.
    But the dollar rallied on news of Monday's meeting in
nervous trading to trade above 1.79 marks Tuesday.
    Poehl said that the recent rise in interest rates was not
due to central bank policy, but to markets' expectations, and
currency developments.
    Commenting on the inflationary expectations, Poehl said "You
have to get to the root of the problem, you have to pursue a
policy which reveals that there are no grounds for such fears."
 The inflationary fears were unjustified and exaggerated, he
said.
    Poehl rebuffed recent U.S. Criticism of West Germany,
saying the Bundesbank had made a substantial contribution to
international cooperation in interest and monetary policy.
    The Bundesbank has tolerated an overshooting of its money
supply target, arousing criticism from other quarters, he said.
    "Today we still have lower interest rates than at the end of
1986... Quite the contrary of other countries, where interest
rates have risen substantially more," Poehl said.
    This had to be taken into account when considering recent
rises in repurchase pact allocation rates, which were due to
rising international money market rates that had spilled over
into the German market, he said.
    Poehl expressed surprise that financial markets had so far
ignored improvements in the U.S. Deficits.
    "The adjustment process in the U.S. Trade balance is
definitely underway," he said, noting that this was not so
noticeable in absolute figures.
    The spectacular improvement in the budget deficit had also
attracted little attention, he said.

<TITLE>LAWSON SAYS BP SHARE OFFER GOING AHEAD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson said the Government was going ahead with this month's
flotation of British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L> shares despite the
collapse on international stock markets.
    "We are going ahead because the whole issue has been
underwritten - we had it underwritten because there is always a
risk of this sort of thing happening," Lawson said in a BBC
radio interview.
    Lawson's remarks came as renewed selling on the London
stock market took BP shares down a further 33p to 283, well
below the 330p price set for the around seven billion stg
issue.
    Lawson said the U.K. Economy is fundamentally sound and
added that stock markets had reflected that recently.
    "I profoundly believe in the market system as the best way
for securing economic prosperity (but) that does not mean to
say the markets are infallible."
    "My advice to small investors...Is to remain calm. There is
absolutely no reason not to do so," Lawson said.

<TITLE>PHILIPPINES APPLAUDS DEFEAT OF U.S. LABELLING BILL</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Diane Stormont</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Philippine coconut industry has
greeted with relief the defeat in the U.S. Senate of a bill
requiring some edible oils to be labelled as saturated fats.
    The bill, which was defeated by the Senate Agriculture
Committee on Monday, could have cost about 60 mln dlrs a year
in lost exports, the Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) said.
    "Naturally, we welcomed the defeat but there is a chance the
bill will be resurrected and attached as a rider to another
Senate bill," a spokesman for the United Coconut Association of
the Philippines (UCAP).
    PCA chairman Jose Romero noted the vote was close, with
eight senators voting for it, 10 against and one abstaining.
    The UCAP spokesman said the American Soybean Association
(ASA) had spent about 25 mln dlrs lobbying for the bill.
    He said the ASA also had obscured the health issue during
the debate.
    "Coconut oil is high in saturated fats, but unlike saturated
animal fats, they do not enter the blood and lymph systems
leaving fatty deposits connected to heart disease," he said.
    U.S. Soybean and cottonseed producers had argued that
saturated fats cause heart disease and that the labels would
discourage consumption by health conscious consumers in favour
of domestic unsaturated alternatives.
    Opponents of the bill said the proposal discriminated
against imports and would damage the Philippines, Malaysia and
Indonesia.
    The Philippines earned 488 mln dlrs from coconut products
in 1986, up from 477 mln in 1985, UCAP figures show.
    Exports to the United States for edible and non-edible use
account for about half of that total, PCA's Romero said.

<TITLE>TOKYO STOCK PLUNGE COULD FORCE EASIER MONEY POLICY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rich Miller</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Plunging Tokyo stock prices will prevent
the Bank of Japan from raising its discount rate and could even
force it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues,
government and private economists said.
    A rise in interest rates now would only serve to spark
further selling of shares that could ultimately have a major
deflationary impact on the real economy, they said.
    Although Bank of Japan officials have consistently
maintained that they had no plans to raise the 2.5 pct discount
rate, many in the markets have thought otherwise. 
    Fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by the
central bank's apparent decision last week to countenance
higher rates on commercial bills, dealers said.
    But today's stock market collapse -- prices fell nearly 15
pct -- means that the Bank of Japan would be hard pressed to
raise the discount rate now, despite its concerns about a
renewed outbreak of inflation, dealers and economists said.
    Japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as the
markets concluded that the stock market's collapse precluded
the central bank from carrying out the widely-rumoured discount
rate increase.
    A senior government economist suggested that both the U.S.
And Japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent a
further drop in New York and Tokyo stock prices. "They need to
support the stock and security markets," he said.
    But Bank of Japan officials said they saw no need to change
policy for the moment, although one admitted that the central
bank may have to rethink its strategy if Tokyo stock prices
continue to plunge during the rest of the week.
    Both government and Bank of Japan economists agreed the
economy is better placed now to cope with the deflationary
impact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago.
    With the economy recovering strongly, the steep drop in
stock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer and
business confidence, one government economist said.
    "There will be some impact on the real economy, but it won't
be that big," said another.
    Individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on their
own, although they do participate through trust funds and other
investment vehicles. And while many manufacturing firms turned
to financial market investments for profits during last year's
economic downturn, the recent rebound has allowed them to
refocus their attention on their core businesses, he said.
    Paradoxically, it is the pick-up in the economy that is
partly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies have
shifted funds away from financial investments to increase
inventories and step up capital spending, one government
economist said.
    In deciding what response to make to the steep stock price
drop, the Bank of Japan must first determine whether prices
will continue to fall further and then decide if they pose a
greater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation,
one central bank official said. "That will at least take a
couple of days, if not weeks," he said.

<TITLE>AQUINO SAYS GROWTH HAS PRIORITY OVER DEBT PAYMENTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Corazon Aquino said economic
growth took priority over debt repayments but she sought to
dispel fears that the Philippines would not honour a July
agreement rescheduling 13.2 billion dlrs of debt.
    In a speech to 13 major business groups, Aquino said, "Our
policy has been very clear fm the start -- growth must take
priority, for the plain and simple reason that if we have no
money to pay, we can't. And if we starve the nation of
essential services, there may be no one around to honour the
debt."
    Aquino said her officials would try to get all 483 creditor
banks to sign the debt rescheduling pact by the November 15
effective date.
    "That should end speculation and remove at least one excuse
for hoarding dollars," Aquino said.
    Violent fluctuations in the peso's exchange rate and the
end of a 17-month bull run in local stock markets have
triggered dollar-hoarding.
    Aquino said the country's foreign debt, which rose to
nearly 29 billion dlrs in April, was growing even without fresh
borrowing.
    Debt servicing took up 40 pct of the budget and 45 pct of
export earnings, Aquino said. Over the next six years, the
Philippines would be paying its creditors 20 billion dlrs while
getting only four billion dlrs in new loans.
    Aquino acknowledged there were grave doubts about her
government's ambitious privatisation program.
    "There is always an excuse for government not to sell," she
said, but she added: "I want government to get out of business."
She said non-performing assets would be sold in open bidding
and Filipinos and foreigners would compete on equal terms.

International Natural Rubber Organization (INRO) has been
adjourned until Thursday as tomorrow is a Malaysian national
holiday, officials of the organisation said.
    The main issue at the talks, which opened here yesterday,
has been the INRO buffer stock and the manner in which the
buffer stock manager should continue to sell rubber after the
current international pact for the commodity expires on October
22, they said.
    The deadline for the start of the new pact is January 1989.
    Buffer stock manager Aldo Hofmeister has been mandated to
continue selling rubber during the interim period.
    Other issues discussed include ratification of the new
accord, the officials said.
    Only Malaysia of the pact's 32 producing and consuming
member countries had ratified the new agreement by the
beginning of this month.
    The meeting is due to end on Thursday.

<DATELINE>    BONN, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg declined to comment on whether unpublished target
zones for currencies agreed at last February's Louvre accord
had been changed as a result of the meeting on Monday with U.S.
Treasury Secretary James Baker.
    He was asked about target zones at a news conference in
Bonn. Stoltenberg referred to a statement released after
Monday's meeting, which said continuing cooperation was aimed
at promoting currency stability at current levels. This was the
same formula used in the text of the Louvre accord, he noted.

    However, he added that in the end, it was market forces

<DATELINE>    NICOSIA, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Attacks on two Iranian oil platforms
in the Gulf -- both of which were still blazing -- caused
damage estimated at 500 mln dlrs, Tehran Radio quoted Iranian
Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying.
    The rigs, one of which was heavily shelled by four American
destroyers on Monday, were still burning almost 24 hours after
the attack and could cause widespread pollution in the Gulf,
the minister told a news conference in Tehran. He said the
Reshadat rigs, 120 miles (200 km) east of Bahrain in
international waters, were in the final stages of
reconstruction after an attack by Iraqi jets last year.

<TITLE>INDONESIA FINDS NEW OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS RESOURCES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Indonesian state-owned oil company
Pertamina has found new offshore oil and gas resources in East
Aceh, on the western tip of northern Sumatra, a company
spokesman said.
    The spokesman said the discovery was made at the GOS IA-1
offshore exploratory well about 38 kms east of Langsa in Aceh.
    "Oil and gas are found in sand layers at the depth of 2,300
metres within the Baong formation," he said.
    He said preliminary tests showed that the well could flow
oil at the rate of 1,320 barrels a day with 50 degrees API at
20 degrees centigrade through a 5/8 inch choke.
    "The well also flows natural gas at the rate of 12 mln
standard cubic feet a day," he added.
    GOS IA-1 well, located at a water depth of 41 metres, was
drilled under a production sharing contract between Pertamina
and Japex North Sumatra Ltd, each having 50 pct shares.
    "Petroleum operations are to be carried out by Pertamina as
operator through a joint operating body established by the two
companies," the Pertamina spokesman stated.
    The contract covers the Gebang block contract area. The two
companies have previously completed the drilling of GOS IIA-1
exploratory well, around 14 kms south of GOS IA-1.

<TITLE>INDONESIA SAYS IT WILL EXTEND OIL CONTRACTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesia told the oil industry on
Tuesday it will extend contracts on producing blocks and
improve the investment climate, but wants to see increased
expenditure on exploration in return.
    President Suharto, in an opening speech to the Indonesian
Petroleum Association, said Indonesia was ready to extend
contracts held by foreign oil companies on producing areas.
    "In order to boost investment in the petroleum industry, the
government of Indonesia has basically approved of extending
production sharing contracts under the present laws," Suharto
said.
    "Apart from that, the government will keep improving the
investment climate in order to accelerate the development of
the petroleum industry," he said.
    Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto told the Association he
was aware that the oil industry needed to be assured that
contracts on blocks expiring within the next 10 years would be
renewed before they would invest in further exploration.
    "As we all have heard this morning, the President is fully
aware of this situation," Subroto said.
    "The government has already made the political decision to
entertain this time problem by inviting the existing producers
to continue their activities in Indonesia, albeit on a
selective basis."
    Indonesia, one of the 13 members of OPEC, must find new oil
reserves if it is to remain an exporter in the next decade, oil
industry sources say.
    Subroto said the government was also working to ease other
problems, including granting easier terms for remote areas or
deep water conditions.
    But Subroto said relations with oil companies were two-way
and that they should step up expenditure on oil exploration now
that the oil price had recovered.
    President Suharto said he wanted to see greater transfer of
technology to Indonesian companies, and more help from the oil
industry for the regions in which companies operated.
    Abdul Rachman Ramly, the President of state oil company
Pertamina, has said that budgeted exploration and production
expenditure for all oil companies in Indonesia was forecast to
fall to 3.1 billion dlrs in calendar 1987 from 3.4 billion in
1986.
    Pertamina has 69 production-sharing or joint operation
contracts with foreign oil companies.
    Subroto said speeding up necessary approvals for field
operations was a government priority. There had been
misunderstandings between the government and the oil industry
in certain areas, such as when a field is designated
commercial, and a thorough evaluation was being made.
    He said the government wanted to finalise contract
extensions as soon as practical, and urged the industry in the
meantime to maintain its exploration drive.
    Subroto said Indonesia needed the companies to maintain
exploration efforts, even if their contract was due to expire
within 10 years. "This need in itself is some sort of guarantee
that we will soon have to come up with an extension agreement."
    Eleven major contract areas are due to come up for renewal
between 1991 and 2001, industry sources said.
    Extension of the contracts on the blocks has involved
detailed negotiations but so far no extension has been granted.
    Subroto told reporters afterwards that contract extensions
would be selective, based on how much capital would be
invested.

<TITLE>IRAN PLANS TO FILE LAWSUITS OVER U.S. RAID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NICOSIA, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iran is preparing lawsuits to file for
compensation from the U.S. Over the American raid on its Gulf
oil platforms, Tehran radio quoted Iranian Oil Minister
Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying.
    The lawsuits would be filed with competent international
bodies once the exact damage was calculated, he was quoted
telling a news conference in Tehran. He earlier estimated the
damage from the U.S. Raid at about 500 mln dlrs.
    The rigs, one of which was heavily shelled by four American
destroyers on Monday, were still burning almost 24 hours after
the attack, he said.
    Aqazadeh said the half-billion-dollar damage estimate was
preliminary. Washington has said the attack was in response to
a missile strike against the American-flag tanker the Sea Isle
City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday.
    He denied that there was any military hardware on the rigs
"except a 23 mm machinegun for air defence." Reacting to
Weinberger's remark that Washington considered the case closed,
Aqazadeh said: "Iran will also consider the case closed after
its retaliatory measure." Iranian officials have said their
response would not be limited to the Gulf and U.S. Interests
around the world might come under attack.
    Aqazadeh said the U.S. Military presence in the Gulf
aggravated the regional crisis and made access to the region's
oil more difficult, but he did not see the U.S. Attack
significantly affecting oil prices.
    IRNA said he gave no explicit reply when asked if the
attack would prompt Iran to block the Hormuz Strait at the
entrance to the Gulf.
    "If Iran cannot use the Hormuz Strait, no other country can
either, and this would be to everyone's harm," the radio quoted
him as saying.

    Multi-family permits were up 5.0 pct in September to
503,000 units after falling 3.0 pct in August.
    Housing starts in September were down 1.2 pct from a

<TITLE>CHEMICAL &lt;CHL>, MARINE MIDLAND &lt;MM> CUT PRIME</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chemical Bank and Marine Midland Banks
Inc said they are cutting their prime lending rate to 9-1/4 pct
from 9-3/4 pct, reversing an increase that they announced just
last week.
    The reduction is effective immediately.
    No other major U.S. bank had followed the lead of Chemical
and Marine Midland, preferring to keep their prime rates at
9-1/4 pct while they waited to see what course money market
rates would take.
    Following Monday's record fall in Wall Street stock prices,
money market rates fell sharply on Tuesday as investors
ploughed proceeds into short-term instruments and the Federal
Reserve said it is prepared to provide liquidity to support the
economy and the financial system.
    Eurodollar deposit rates in London fell by as much as 9/16
percentage point, Treasury bill rates fell by as much as half a
point (after falling between 59 and 84 basis points on Monday),
and the Fed funds rate dropped to 7-1/4 pct from Monday's
average of 7.61 pct. Speculation even surfaced of a discount
rate cut to calm the markets, dealers said.

<TITLE>U.S. COFFEE IMPORT REPORTING SYSTEM QUESTIONED</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    BY Susan Zeidler</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>A voluntary compliance system for
monitoring U.S. coffee imports under quotas is viewed
skeptically by many in the coffee industry, said analysts and
trade sources.
    "Many sectors of the trade, including large roasters and 
importers, are adamant against voluntary compliance because of
the past, which was subject to tremendous irregularities as it
became a matter of the trade monitoring each other," one
analyst said.
    On Monday, a National Coffee Association newsletter said
the Office of U.S. Trade Representative will implement a
voluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation to
monitor imports is tied up in the Congressional trade bill.
    Under the arrangement, milar to one in 1980, coffee
importers would voluntarily present needed documents to the
U.S. government until Congress approves the monitoring
authority, but if coffee arrives without valid certification,
it will still be allowed entry.
    While many believe producers will not seek to add to the
overburdened stock situation in the U.S., others believe some
will ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu of
monitoring controls, trade sources said.
    "Last time, there was a lot of false information submitted
to customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines," a
U.S. Customs spokesman said.
    "Customs can do a good job when given the tools, but when
its hands are tied, it doesn't have the authority to demand
Form O (documents tracking merchandise from source to
destination)," he said.
    Many see it as a true test of whether producers and
importers will abide by the quota system.
    "It is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in the
quota agreement," said one major U.S. roaster.
     "Last time we had a gentleman's agreement, the trade did
not act as a gentleman," said another analyst adding, "without
the need to submit documents, the ball will be in the
producers' hands."
    Some feel that importers will take advantage of the
voluntary compliance due to development of a two-tier market,
in which non-member countries buy coffee at a big discount.
Many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non-member
countries at discounts and then bring it into the U.S. falsely
labelled.
    According to customs officials, several green coffee
importers confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffee
fraudulently after buying it for non-member destinations,
forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navy
beans.
    "If there's that much of a discrepancy between prices for
one country and another, producers may be teted to get rid of
their stocks of coffee by selling to non-member nations and by
circumventing the quota provisions," said Paine Webber analyst
Bernie Savaiko.
    Still, others believe that producers will not be hard
pressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation in
the U.S. in the near term.
    "It would be naive to suggest that any agreement would not
have some share of connivance, but I think the voluntary system
seemed to suffice and, coupled with the fact that we have so
much coffee, I don't think that it poses that much of a
threat," one trader said.

<TITLE>OILMEAL DEMAND STILL STRONG IN U.S., SOVIET UNION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HAMBURG, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Oilmeal demand remained strong in the
United States in July and August and six pct up on levels seen
in the same months last year, with most of the rise coming in
soymeal, the Hamburg based publication Oil World said.
    Total U.S domestic usage of the nine major oilmeals rose to
a record 19 mln tonnes in October 1986/August 1987, up 4.2 pct
on the same year-ago period, with the increase in soymeal at
seven pct, it said.
    Soviet soymeal demand rose by 310,000 tonnes in July and
330,000 tonnes in August over the respective year-ago months
following a huge increase in soymeal imports.
    Oil World presumed some imports were not used immediately
but went into stocks. With imports again large in September, it
estimated Soviet soymeal stocks sharply up at 800,000 tonnes by
October 1 from around 130,000 at the same time last year.
    EC oilmeal demand rose 100,000 tonnes in August from a year
earlier, with soymeal up 45,000 tonnes. Crushings of rapeseed,
sunseed and soybeans will probably rise from last year due to
bumper EC crops. It estimated the EC rapeseed crop at a record
5.9 mln tonnes, up from 3.7 mln last year. Rapeseed disposals
were reported at 2.1 mln tonnes by September 20 against 1.4 mln
at that time last year.

<TITLE>CRAZY EDDIE &lt;CRZY.O> AMENDS SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    EDISON, N.J., Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Crazy Eddie Inc said its board of
directors amended the company's shareholder rights plan in
moves it said were designed to preserve stockholder protection
and provide flexibility to the plan.
    Yesterday, Crazy Eddie agreed not to oppose a slate of
candidates to its board proposed by the Committee to Restore
Stockholder Value, a shareholder group led by the
&lt;Oppenheimer-Palmieri Fund L.P.> and Entertainment Marketing
Inc &lt;EM>, that has been seeking to oust current management.
    Crazy Eddie said the new amendments limit future amendments
to the plan, modify the definition of "continuing directors"
and permit amendment or termination of the plan with the
consent of the company's shareholders if there are no
continuing directors in office or the approval of at least
three such directors cannot be obtained.
    The company also said it approved a certificate of
designation with respect to its 4.5 mln shares of authorized,
but previously undesignated and unissued shares of preferred
stock and adopted an employee stock ownership plan.
    Crazy Eddie also that it requested that the shareholder
group make a commitment not to take the company private until
Crazy Eddie has had a chance to recover from current financial
difficulties, a committment that the group rejected.
    Crazy Eddie said it will hold its annual shareholders
meeting on November 6.

    Reagan said the accord is designed to stabilize rubber
prices without disturbing long-term market trends and to foster
expanded natural rubber supplies at reasonable prices.
    It continues a buffer stock of not more than 550,000 tonnes
established by a 197agreement. This will be used to defend a
regularly adjusted price range and will be financed equally by
importing and exporting members of the agreement.

<TITLE>NO PRESSING NEED FOR SOVIET WHEAT SUBSIDY - LYNG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Soviets have not indicated an
urgent need for a U.S. wheat subsidy offer, and it is unlikely
that such an offer will be ma during the U.S./Soviet summit
expected to be held next month, Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng told Reuters.
    In an exclusive interview with Reuters, Lyng said he did
not know if the United States will offer Moscow another wheat
subsidy offer this year or when that offer will be made.
    "Last year it was well into the year before we offered it.
There's been nothing that's taken place to indicate to me that
there's a pressing need on their part for that sort of deal (a
wheat subsidy)."
    When asked if a subsidy would be offered at a U.S./Soviet
summit, Lyng said, "No, I don't think so. I don't think that."
    The Agriculture Secretary said a U.S. wheat subsidy deal to
Moscow would not be the kind of topic appropriate for
discussion at a summit.
    "It would not be the kind of issue that the President or the
Chairman would get into specific negotiations or discussions
about," Lyng said.
    "When Mr. Nikonov (communist party secretary for
agriculture) was here ... he indicated that trade in wheat was
not something that would be discussed with the President of the
United States. He said it's not presidential," Lyng said.
    Lyng said uncertainties about wheat quality in some major
producing areas of the world, volatile wheat prices and the
still unfinished Soviet grain harvest could delay any final
decision on the timing of another wheat subsidy to Moscow.
    The future of the U.S./Soviet long-term grains agreement
will be discussed the first of next year, Lyng said, but the
Agriculture Secretary questioned the benefits of the
long-standing agreement.
    "We've had three years in a row in which the Soviets have
failed to live up to their end of the agreement ... We would
love to continue to keep doing busines with the Soviet Union,
but do we need a long-term agreement. Who benefits from that.
These are some of the questions we need to discuss."
    When asked if he felt the United States has benefitted from
the agreement, Lyng said, "I don't know. It certainly hasn't
been what we had hoped it would be. For three years running
they've (Moscow) failed to live up to what we considered was an
agreement."

<TITLE>LYNG SAYS INDIA FOOD AID PACKAGE NOT READY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States and India have
not yet agreed on a food aid package to help the
drought-stricken Asian country, Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng said.
    Lyng told Reuters in an interview that the two countries
have been discussing a package but that he did not expect the
specifics of the offer to be announced during Indian Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi's visit here this week.
    "We have been talking about the potential needs that India
might have for both their commercial market and purchases needs
as well as the possibilities of assistance," Lyng said.
    "At this point, there is no detailed plan or program. The
amounts of what commodities are uncertain. But we have
indicated to the Indians that we stand ready to assist in
whatever way they deem most valuable," he said.
    There has been speculation in trade circles that USDA would
offer India subsidized vegetable oil under the export
enhancement program and donate surplus corn under Section 419
of an amended 1949 law.
    Lyng indicated the two countries have been unable to agree
on the mix of concessional and commercial aid, and that
Washington would prefer the package include something other
than donated food.
    "The Indians are capable of purchasing a lot, of taking care
of themselves. India is a country that has come a long way in
its ability to produce food and they have a great pride in
that," Lyng said.
    "We (the United States) obviously, with the surpluses we
still have of many commodities..., would like to share in the
import business the Indians do, and then we have some, as we
always do, compassion for the people of India and would like to
cooperate with them," he said.
    Lyng said he had no plans to meet with Indian officials
during Gandhi's visit here, adding, "I just don't know of
anything that might be announced specifically."
    Asked if "the ball was in the Indians' court," he said, "Yes."
    Gandhi is to leave Washington Tuesday evening.

SHULTZ SAYS U.S. ECONOMY IS STRONG LONDON, Oct 20 - U.S.
Secretary of State George Shultz, after discussing Monday's
record selling spree on the world's stock markets with British
Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe, said the American economy
"is in very strong shape." Shultz, a former economics professor
and former Treasury Secretary, said "the underlying fact ... If
you look at the U.S. Economy, is that we continue to have a
very strong economic performance." He cited as positive factors
declining U.S. Unemployment and low inflation.
    Shultz said he did not know to what extent the stock
selling frenzy reflected concerns about U.S. Trade and budget
deficits.

<TITLE>LOUVRE REAFFIRMATION NOT ENOUGH - U.K. ANALYSTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rowena Whelan</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. And West German reaffirmation of
support for the Louvre Accord cannot cure the fundamental
problems bedevilling the world economy which lie behind the
current collapse in stock markets, London economists said.
    "There's going to have to be some acknowledgement that the
dollar is going to be allowed to slip," said Richard Jeffrey of
Hoare Govett. "If not, there is going to be continued fear that
when pressure emerges on the dollar, the Fed will be forced to
tighten. This throws up the economic abyss of recession in the
U.S. With obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world."
    But some economists added that Wall Street's crash, which
dragged other major markets down with it, may help curb the
very problems that sparked the turmoil - namely world inflation
fears and the massive and persistent U.S. Trade deficits.
    "If there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in Wall Street
...It's some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide," said
Geoffrey Dennis of brokers James Capel, echoing comments from
other London and Tokyo analysts.
    Lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears of
further falls should dampen credit growth, curbing inflationary
pressures and import demand in the U.S., They say.
    Such considerations may be helping bond markets resist the
equity crash, according to Mike Osborne of Kleinwort Grieveson.
    "It would be suicidal for any government in the context of
what happened in the last couple of days to jack up their
interest rates," he added.
    Stocks surged after news Chemical Bank cut its prime
lending rate half a point to 9.25 pct Tuesday and U.S. Fed
chairman Alan Greenspan pledged support for the financial
system.
    The news eroded the most immediate fears that the stock
collapse would spill over into the economy, via a banking
crisis for example, thus precipitating recession.
    It also helped the dollar rally sharply, to a high of
1.8200 marks from a European low of 1.7880. But economists said
today's whiplash moves do not have long term significance and
that markets should try to keep the underlying fundamentals in
mind.
    "The United States has been able to live on borrowed time.
If the effect of this (crash) is to produce slower economic
growth not recession...It contains good news (and) provides a
more realistic assessment of the U.S. Economy," said Capel's
Dennis. But he added that markets are still very much in
danger.
    "The liquidity doesn't disappear...All it's doing is
disappearing from the equity markets," Dennis noted.
    David Morrison of Goldman Sachs International said world
market turbulence will be exacerbated if the Group of Seven
(G-7) leading western nations confirms a base for the dollar,
as implied by West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg's remarks that intervention to support currencies
is still on.
    Last week's dollar fall was partly triggered by
expectations that the Germans were more worried about the money
supply impact of such intervention than maintaining currency
stability.
    But rigid adherence to dollar ranges would be bad, said
Morrison. "The Louvre Accord is fundamentally misconceived. To
stabilise the dollar at too high a level is wrong," he said.

<TITLE>U.K. CREDIT POLICY SEEN STEADY, DESPITE BANK DATA</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Sandy Critchley</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>An unexpectedly heavy 4.4 billion stg
surge in U.K. September sterling bank lending is unlikely to
nudge the Bank of England towards tightening monetary policy as
long as sterling remains in its present robust state,
economists said.
    An acute crisis of confidence in equity markets over the
past two days will in any case subdue personal consumer credit
demand which has largely been behind growth in lending.
    "In the normal course of events the markets would have been
extremely worried about that figure," noted Peter Spencer, U.K.
Economist with Credit Suisse First Boston.
    After an initial dip in reaction to the bank lending data,
which compared won stg August rise, U.K.
Government bonds (gilts) soared as investors continued to flee
from plummetting equities into the relative security of
government securities.
    Equity markets dropped sharply on the news, touching a
day's low of 1,766.7 on the FTSE 100 index after the data,
before staging a recovery. Sterling held its buoyant tone
throughout.
    U.K. Money market rates, in a similarly calm response,
resumed the slightly easier trend of earlier in the morning
after little more than a token blip as the figures came out.
    Noting that such a huge rise in credit extended by banks
would under other circumstances have prompted market fears of a
rise in clearing bank base rates from the current 10 pct, "With
the financial markets doing what they're doing, that's the last
thing the Bank of England would want to do," Spencer said.
    "The monetary situation is clearly very bad but as long as
sterling is firm, the authorities are unlikely to put rates up,"
said Kevin Boakes, chief U.K. Economist at Greenwell Montagu
Gilt Edged. Boakes pointed to a rise in the narrow money
measure M0 to 5.2 pct year-on-year from August's 4.5 pct
growth, which he said must cause some concern at the Treasury.
    But "The fact that overall broad money growth has slowed
down is a rather encouraging sign," noted Paul Temperton, U.K.
Economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. He pointed to a
fall in the year-on-year growth rate of the M3 broad money
aggregate to 19.5 pct in September from August's 22 pct.
    It was concern about credit growth which prompted the Bank
of England to engineer a one point rise in U.K. Bank base rates
to 10 pct in early August, caution endorsed subsequently by
news of a massive 4.9 billion stg July rise in bank lending.
    Temperton noted that a particular focus of bank worry in
that period had been the behaviour of U.K. Asset markets.
    Housing and equities were the key two asset markets in
influencing consumer behaviour, he said.
    In the light of the precipitous falls on U.K. Equity
markets in the past few days, "There will almost certainly be a
straightforward impact on consumer spending and on retail
sales," Temperton said.
    "Almost certainly we can look forward to slower growth in
consumer borrowing if the equity shakeout continues," he added.
    "I think the stock market has decided that the bank lending
figure is a thing of the past...We are talking about a very
serious panic and a flight to quality," Spencer said.
    A U.K. Treasury official said that it was important to look
at all the monetary information, not just the bank lending,
adding that monetary aggregates were growing much more slowly
than bank lending.
    Senior banking sources noted that the surge in bank lending
was evidence of the continuing recent trend of fairly heavy
personal sector borrowing.
    Figures from the Banking Information Service showed
personal sector lending by U.K. Clearing banks rose by 1.66
billion stg in September after a 978 mln stg August rise. Much
of the rise reflected quarterly interest payments.

repurchase agreements, economists said.
    They expected the amount to total around 1.5 billion to two
billion dlrs.
    Economists added that the low rate on federal funds
indicates the Fed is unlikely to add funds agressively through
overnight system repurchases, unless it feels the need to calm
volatile financial markets.
    Federal funds were trading at 7-1/8 pct, down from
yesterday's average of 7.61 pct.

by rising exports, have hit a record high and are likely to
soar to 72 billion U.S. Dlrs by the year end, central bank
officials said Tuesday.
    Central Bank Governor Chang Chi-cheng told reporters the
reserves totalled about 69 billion U.S. Dlrs, compared with
about 42 billion at the same time last year and 68 billion on
October 5. He declined to elaborate.
    A senior bank official, who declined to be named, told
Reuters the reserves were likely to reach 72 billion dlrs at
the end of the year.
    "The surge in reserves is the result of our trade surplus
and recent purchases of U.S. Dollars on the local interbank
market," Chang said.
    Taiwan's trade surplus hit a record 14.95 billion U.S. Dlrs
in the first nine months of 1987 compared with 11.05 billion a
year earlier, official figures show.
    Vice Economic Minister Wang Chien-hsien said the surplus
will rise to about 20 billion dlrs by the end of the year.
About 80 pct of the surplus will come from the island's trade
with the United States. 
    Chien said Taiwan's trade will reach 80 billion U.S. Dlrs
this year compared with 63.96 billion last year.
    Its exports are expected to total 50 billion and imports 30
billion against exports of 39.79 billion and imports of 24.17
billion last year.

shortcovering demand at the Colombo rubber auction, brokers
said.
    One-X brown was traded at 19.75 rupees per kg, up 15 cents
from last rates while other grades also showed improvements.
The rise was attributed to a shortage of rubber available to
manufacture this type.
    Latex crepe prices were unchanged with the best one-X
selling at 20.92 rupees. Crepe one was traded at 20.68 and
crepe two at 20.45 rupees.
    Sheet was firm as in previous weeks with RSS1 averaging
22.05 rupees against 22 previously. The total quantity of
rubber offered at the sale was 320 tonnes.

<TITLE>NORWAY BOOSTS OIL OUTPUT BY 22 PCT IN SEPTEMBER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OSLO, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Norway's September oil output rose by 22.2
pct to 1.07 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 830,492 bpd in
August, according to a Reuter survey of firms operating here.
    Operators said the sharp rise reflected higher output at
several of Norway's biggest fields and resumed production at
fields shut down for 27 days in August for the Ekofisk field
rescue project.
    Industry analysts said the increase did not exceed Norway's
voluntary move to curb by 7.5 pct planned growth in its oil
output, a move designed to back OPEC-led efforts to stabilise
oil prices by limiting supplies to world crude markets.
    Norway, not an OPEC member, decided in June to extend the
production restraints, enforced since February 1 1987, on all
its North Sea fields for the rest of the year.
    Oil Minister Arne Oeien said last month he expected Norway
would extend into 1988 its policy of slowed production growth.
    The biggest increase was seen on the Ekofisk field, which
pumped 168,023 bpd in September against 48,195 bpd in August,
field operator Phillips Petroleum Norway Inc said.
    Ekofisk and the nearby Valhall and Ula fields, which use
the Ekofisk pipeline, were shut down for most of August while
Phillips raised Ekofisk platforms to counter seabed subsidence.
    BP Petroleum Development Norway Ltd, operator of the Ula
field, said September output rose to 86,727 bpd after dropping
to 27,237 bpd in August because of the shutdown.
    Valhall, operated by Amoco Norway A/S, flowed 74,694 bpd
last month compared with 69,748 bpd in August, the company
said.
    September production was also sharply higher at the
Statfjord field. Norway's 84 pct share of Statfjord, which
extends into the British North Sea sector, was 611,138 bpd
against 552,646 bpd in August, operator Den Norske Stats
Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil) said.
    Norway's 22.2 pct share of the Murchison field which, like
Statfjord, extends into the British sector, yielded 15,388 bpd
in September, a slight 920 bpd decrease from the previous
month, Norwegian partners on the British-operated field said.
    Statoil boosted output at its Gullfaks field to 109,670 bpd
in September, compared with 100,188 in August.
    Norsk Hydro, operator of the Oseberg field, said test
output at the field from the mobile production ship Petro Jarl
totalled 1,719 bpd last month, down sharply from 16,170 bpd in
August.
    Hydro said the drop was caused by failure to bring on
stream a second well, cutting September production to just two
days.

Corp said it acquired a five pct stake in Cosmo Communications
Corp, and is considering a move to seek control of the company
or to secure a role in its affairs.
    "Bastian Technologies believes that with the appropriate
management policies and business strategies, the company can
once again become profitable and maximize for all shareholders
the underlying value of their company," Bastian said in a
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
    Bastian said alternatives being considered include an
attempt to acquire Cosmo through a merger, tender or exchange
offer, seeking to influence the company's management and
policies, and seeking representation on Cosmo's board of
directors through a proxy contest or otherwise.
    Bastian said it may contact third parties regarding its
intentions toward Cosmo, adding it intends to request a meeting
with Cosmo representatives to discuss its investment in Cosmo
stock.
    Bastian currently holds 253,700 Cosmo common shares, or
five pct of the total outstanding.
    The shares were purchased from Nasta International Inc
&lt;NAS> on October 16 for about 1.15 mln dlrs, Bastia said.

<TITLE>IRAN LEADER VOWS REVENGE ON US RAID IN COMING DAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NICOSIA, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iran's top war spokesman Ali Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani on Tuesday called the U.S. Attacks on two of
its Gulf oil platforms an escalation and promised retaliation.
    "God willing, we will carry out our duty in the coming days
and make them sorry," said Rafsanjani in a speech to Parliament
later broadcast by Tehran Radio.
    The Tehran leadership have been quick to threaten vengeance
after the U.S. Raids on the rigs, one of which was destroyed.
    President Ali Khamenei, Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi
and now Rafsanjani within 24 hours of the U.S. Action have all
vowed retaliation.
    Rafsanjani, the parliamentary speaker, said, "It is not a
threat or an attempt at intimidation when we say we will
respond to aggression -- it is a reality and we have proved it
in practice." He added that the American attack "squares neither
with its superpower image nor its claim of concern with
security, nor reason and wisdom."
    U.S. Warships shelled an Iranian offshore oil platform and
American special forces boarded another, destroying equipment.
    The U.S. Government said the attack was a measured response
to an Iranian missile attack on the American-flagged Kuwaiti
tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters last Friday.

<TITLE>LYNG PLEASED EC TO OFFER GATT FARM PROPOSAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng said he is pleased the European Community plans to offer a
global farm reform plan at GATT later this month, although the
United States opposes key parts of the proposal.
    "We're pleased that they have moved in tabling a proposal.
It will help us in getting the negotiations underway," Lyng
told Reuters in an interview Tuesday.
    Lyng's comment came after EC ministers in Luxembourg
endorsed a farm reform package drafted by the EC Commission.
The EC plan will be presented at the next meeting of Uruguay
round agriculture negotiators in Geneva on October 26.
    Lyng said the United States would oppose parts of the plan
seeking a market sharing agreement for grains, and proposing
curbs on U.S. soybean and cereal substitute exports to Europe.
    The U.S. in July proposed to GATT the elimination of all
farm subsidies affecting trade within ten years, and has
pressed the EC to make a counter-offer with the aim of reaching
a global farm subsidy agreement by the end of 1988.
    However, the EC and some U.S. domestic groups have said the
Reagan administration plan to end all farm trade subsidies is
unrealistic.
    Asked about such criticism, Lyng said "The alternative to
doing that is to say that we preserve them and maintain them. I
think that is the unrealistic position."
    "I would suggest that they (EC) listen to what we are
trying to say."
    Lyng also rejected suggestions the U.S. and EC agree a
freeze in export subsidies to get the GATT negotiations 
started.
    "All that some countries would like to have would be a
wheat agreement where we would stop export subsidies on wheat.
That doesn't do a thing for us," Lyng said.
    The United States wants an end to subsidies in a range of
agricultural products from dairy products to vegetable oils, he
said.
    At the GATT negotiators meeting next week Canada is
expected to offer a proposal as well as the EC.
    The United States will be represented at the meeting by
former agriculture undersecretary Daniel Amstutz, recently
appointed special U.S. negotiator on agriculture.

<TITLE>BETHLEHEM STEEL &lt;BS> SETS STEEL PRICE INCREASES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BETHLEHEM, Pa., Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bethlehem Steel Corp said prices
for steel sheet products will be increased up to 30 dlrs a ton
effective January 3.
    The increases will affect certain non-contract or spot
transactions and will be achieved through reductions in
competitive discounts.
    The company said transaction prices for contract accounts,
which have a duration of six months or more, will also be
increased to commensurate levels.
    Percentage increases were not immediately available.
    Prices for flat-rolled steel sheet, used in automobiles,
appliances and other products, vary widely between about 350
and 800 dlrs a ton.
    The company said it was taking the actions to restore sheet
transaction prices to more equitable levels. In many cases,
prices are still lower than those attained in 1984, it said.
    Bethlehem also said that in response to changing market
conditions and potential inflationary pressures, efforts will
be made to mininize the number and the duration of firm price
contracts.

<TITLE>IBC SEEKS EXPORT DETAILS TO SET COFFEE QUOTAS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Brazilian Coffee Institute
(IBC) has given shippers until close of business on Thursday to
submit details of past export performance in order that
individual quotas can be allocated, an IBC spokesman said.
    He told Reuters IBC President Jorio Dauster has confirmed
acceptance of National Coffee Policy Council (CNPC) proposals
to establish individual export quotas based 65 pct on export
performance, 25 pct on stocks and 10 pct by auction.
    Shippers can choose their best period of 12 consecutive
months between April 1, 1985, and September 30, 1987, to be
used for calculating the export performace portion.
    The IBC will total all the figures, calculate each shippers
participation and use this as a basis for allocation of
individual quotas, the IBC spokesman said.
    He said the IBC has already settled with the Sao Paulo
Mercantile Exchange how the auction system will operate.
Shippers can bid a premium over the contribution quota payable
on coffee exports and the succesful bidder will add this
premium to the contribution quota when he submits his export
sales declaration form.
    Auctions will not start until after the opening of export
registrations. The spokesman could not say when this might be
but trade sources said an announcement could come at the end of
the week, opening registraions from Monday.
    A meeting has been set for tomorrow in Brasilia of the
CNPC's export marketing committee to establish a system for
allocating the 25 pct of export quotas based on stock levels,
the spokesman added.
    A system of individual export quotas is being reestablished
in Brazil - a previous system was abandoned in 1985 - to ensure
shipments are kept in line with the country's ICO quota.

<TITLE>COPA URGES TAX ON VEGETABLE PROTEINS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community's farmers'
pressure group Copa has urged EC farm ministers to agree a tax
on vegetable proteins similar to the oils and marine fats tax
which has already been proposed by the EC Commission.
    Copa president Hans Kjeldsen told a news conference on
Tuesday he had also urged ministers to seek a similar mechanism
for cereal substitutes.
    He was speaking after a meeting of farm leaders with the
Danish foreign and agriculture ministers, who currently chair
meetings of their EC colleagues.
    Kjeldsen said taxes on the products concerned would help
the EC's budget problems and would provide some price stability
for producers.
    This would in turn help the market position for certain
crops of which the EC is a net importer such as oilseeds, peas
and beans, but for which the Commission is now proposing severe
output restrictions.
    A minority of EC ministers opposed to an oils and fats tax
on imported and domestically produced oils and marine fats
succeeded in blocking the idea during this year's annual EC
price fixing.
    However, the EC Commission has said it maintains its
proposals for a tax.
    Kjeldsen said Copa had urged the ministers to pursue
international negotiations on farm trade with the aim of
bridging the gap between EC and world prices.

<TITLE>JACOBS SELLS STAKE IN GILLETTE &lt;GS></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs said he
sold the stake he held in Gillette Co &lt;GS> after deciding that
he could not force Gillette to accept a 47 dlr a share takeover
bid made by Revlon Group Inc &lt;REV>.
    Revlon's bid expired last week after being repeatedly
rejected by Gillette. Jacobs had earlier considered waging a
proxy fight over Gillette.
    Jacobs told Reuters he sold the Gillette stake, which he
called "substantial" but under five pct, a few weeks ago over a
period of several days. He said he sold the stock at a profit,
but did not disclose the selling price.
    Gillette's stock was at 24-1/8, up 1/8, in morning trade,
off the high of 45-7/8 reached after Revlon announced its bid.
    Jacobs said he sold his Gillette stake based on an
"investment decision. I surely did not see this happening," he
said of Monday's stock market free-fall.
    A Gillette spokesman said the mpany had no comment.
    Jacobs said he and fellow investor Carl Pohlad continue to
hold a stake in Allegheny International Inc &lt;AG>. In August
they disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing
that they had acquired 854,900 shares, or 7.9 pct, of Allegheny
and would consideer seeking control of the company.

<TITLE>DONALD REGAN SAYS U.S. SHOULD EASE CREDIT SUPPLY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Donald Regan, President Reagan's
former chief of staff, said the government should loosen the
money supply, try to keep interest rates down and try to reduce
the federal budget and trade deficits to avoid a recession.
    "I think what we have to face now is trying to preserve our
economy," the one-time chairman of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc
&lt;MER> said in an interview on the ABC television network.
    "We've got to loosen money, we've got to keep interest rates
down. We can't afford to let them go up. That means we're going
to have to work on our twin deficits, both the budget deficit
and the trade deficit," Regan said.
     "I certainly wouldn't tighten money at this particular
moment," Regan said when asked about the prospects for a
recession following Monday's price drop on Wall Street.
    "I think that if they were to do that, they'd create the
same conditions that we did in '29...They choked off the money
supply and what happened? We went into a major recession. I
think that's the one thing we've got to avoid right now."
    Regan also called on the government to impose restrictions
on program trading. "I think that that's exacerbated,
exaggerated this decline, and I think it's something that they
must stop," he said.

Farren opposed language in the trade bill before Congress to
limit foreign takeovers of U.S. companies.
    "Anything that would serve to have a chilling effect on
foreign investment is going to cost us jobs and economic
growth," Farren said before a congressional coittee.
    House and Senate negotiators are ironing out differences in
trade bills passed by both chambers. Once the negotiators reach
agreement, the bill will be sent to President Reagan for his
signature.

<TITLE>GATT CASE AGAINST JAPAN A MODEL FOR U.S. - LYNG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
said the ruling of a GATT panel on a U.S. trade complaint
against Japan, expected soon, may influence the U.S. stance in
negotiations with Tokyo on beef and citrus import quotas.
    The ruling of a GATT tribunal on a U.S. demand that Japan
end quotas on 12 categories of food items is expected by the
end of the year. Lyng said he is optimistic the ruling will
favor the U.S.
    "These are quota items, and the principles that apply to
them, it seems to me, will have some bearing on the question of
whether you would have quotas or not on beef and citrus," Lyng
told Reuters in an interview.
    He repeated the U.S. demand that Japan lift the quotas on
beef and citrus after March 31, next year.
    The Japanese quotas on 12 food categories which the United
States has challenged include items such as tomato paste, some
cheeses and specialty fruit juices.
    U.S. officials had hoped a ruling against the quotas would
be issued earlier this year but the GATT panel decision has
been delayed by the illness of the tribunal's chairman.
    The U.S. has taken a hardline stance on the beef and citrus
quotas, which Tokyo says must remain in place to protect
Japanese farmers.
    "We will not negotiate new quotas or accept new quotas (on
beef and citrus). If they impose them we would consider that an
illegal action in the GATT, Lyng said.
    He declined to say what action the U.S. would take next
April if Japan continues to resist U.S. demands.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Britain's highest court has decided the
International Tin Council (ITC) can appeal over the use of ITC
documents in court actions.
    On November 2 the House of Lords will decide if and to what
extent ITC documents, whether circulated or not, are admissible
as court evidence. Lawyers working in the legal tangle left
from the October 1985 collapse of the tin market said this
hearing is likely to last a few days.
    On Wednesday the Court of Appeal will link the outstanding
ITC cases that have so far reached it and a single set of
hearings could begin in early January, they added.
    The House of Lords ruling on the use of ITC documents will
be referred back to the action by two Shearson Lehman companies
against the London Metal Exchange although the underlying case
is not expected to be resumed until mid-1988.
    The Court of Appeal hearings include action between brokers
and cases by brokers and banks against the ITC and the member
governments of the tin council.
    Action taken by brokers seeking both the winding up of the
ITC or and placing it into receivership will also be covered by
the Court of Appeal legal schedule.

<TITLE>ASA SAYS EC OILSEED POLICY ILLEGAL UNDER GATT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>        LONDON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The American Soybean Association (ASA)
denounced European Community (EC) oilseed policies as illegal
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and
threatened to make an unfair trade complaint if the EC does not
remedy the situation.
    ASA Vice President James Adams told an ASA-sponsored
Outlook 87 conference: "It will be filed unless the EC takes
drastic and immediate steps."
    "These subsidies are blatantly unfair and are GATT illegal,
since they were established after the zero soybean duty was
established in 1962," he said.
    The ASA's unfair trade petition against the EC would ask
for an investigation and modification of EC oilseed policies to
make the regime non-discriminatory.
    The EC in 1962 ruled all EC oilseed imports duty-free, in
an effort to fill its oilseed needs. But EC oilseeds production
has risen dramatically since then.
    The EC now guarantees oilseed prices to farmers above world
market levels and is considering implementing a controversial
oils and fats tax.
    The subsidies "are obvious attempts to circumvent the zero
duty binding and that makes U.S. Farmers mad as hell," Adams
said.
    The ASA is confident the U.S. Congress will support its
trade complaint, Adams said. The ASA also strongly opposes an
EC proposal to tax vegetable and marine oils consumed in the
EC, which will be considered by the EC Commission in December.
    U.S. Soybean world market share has declined 35 pct in
volume and 40 pct in value since 1982, primarily as a result of
EC policies, Adams added.
    Lord Plumb, European Parliament President and a speaker at
the conference, said the EC expanded oilseed production in 1973
when the U.S. Halted overseas sales of soy products.

<TITLE>U.S. TAKES TOUGH STAND ON GATT FARM ISSUES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Lisa Vaughan</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States is prepared to "pull out
all the stops" to defend its agricultural trade rights under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), U.S. Ambassador
to GATT Michael Samuels said.
    Those rights are now being challenged by the European
Community's (EC) agricultural support policies, he told a
conference sponsored by the American Soybean Association.
    He reiterated Washington's firm intention to retaliate if
the EC goes ahead and bans imports of hormone-fed beef without
the issue being investigated by a GATT special committee.
    The U.S. claims the EC directive, due to come into effect
on January 1, threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of U.S. meat
shipments into the EC.
    The U.S. also will oppose all EC efforts to impair U.S.
trade via the EC oilseeds regime, which supports EC oilseed
prices over the current market level and which may be extended
to include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax, Samuels said.
    Reduction of trade-distorting world agricultural subsidies,
an aim of most key participants in GATT multilateral trade
negotiations, "is meaningless if import barriers continue to be
erected," Samuels said.
    Samuels called the U.S. plan to eliminate world farm
subsidies by the year 2000, proposed at GATT in July, "visionary"
and "very serious."  The EC and Japan have said it is
unrealistic.
    The EC Commission this month announced its draft proposal
on farm trade reform, expected to be tabled at GATT formally
next week.
    The EC scheme involves emergency measures to reduce
tensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cereals
substitutes, dairy and sugar. It also calls for reduction of
farm subsidies.
    The U.S. Is not opposed to short-term measures, as long as
they are directly linked to long-term commitments to end major
trade distortions, Samuels said.
    Washington will review the EC proposal when it is formally
submitted and respond to it officially then.
    "We will consider its relation to the Punta del Este
declaration to correct trade problems and expand market access,"
the U.S. Ambassador said.
    The U.S. can say no to the EC proposal if the EC ignores
the U.S. plan when it tables its own proposal, he added.
    The key difference between the two approaches is that the
U.S. wants farm subsidies eliminated, while the EC is pushing
only for a reduction in farm suppports, Samuels said.
    If the EC farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze,
there would be little incentive for the Community to work to
correct the international trade situation, he added.
    Samuels cited the animal hormones complaint, the EC
oilseeds regime and an EC regulation concerning meat imports to
third countries as three crucial barriers to trade which the
U.S. wants to see resolved under the auspices of GATT.

<TITLE>US WARNS IRAN, BEGINS ESCORTING TANKER CONVOY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States warned Iran again 
that it was ready to retaliate for any further hostile military
action in the Gulf as U.S. warships began escorting another
tanker convoy southward from Kuwait.
    U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said the U.S.
sought no further Gulf hostitilies but was ready to deal with
any Iranian response to Monday's attack on an Iranian oil rig.
    Several hours later, the Pentagon announced that U.S.
warships had begun escorting two U.S. flag Kuwaiti tankers --
the 80,000 ton product carrier Ocean City and 46,000 ton
liquified petroleum tanker Gas King -- southward from Kuwait.
    The Defense Department said the 12th such convoy of U.S.
flagged Kuwaiti tankers through the Gulf began at 0230 EDT
under the escort by the U.S. guided missile frigate Ford. It
did not say what oth U.S. warships were in the area.
    "It (the convoy) is now progressing uneventfully in the
central Gulf," the Pentagon statement said.
    Asked on NBC's "Today" program if the United States was
prepared for a major war with Iran, Weinberger said, "Well we
are prepared I think for whatever eventualities emerge from
this situation but we don't look on it as a war."

<TITLE>LYNG DEFENDS U.S. EXPORT SUBSIDY PROGRAM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng said the United States will continue its policy of
subsidizing farm exports to regain lost markets until there is
a global agreement to end such subsidies.
    In an interview with Reuters, Lyng also acknowledged he was
troubled by the prospect that the export enhancement program
(EEP) could prove so indispensable to boosting U.S. exports
that the U.S. would have difficulty abandoning it.
    "Yes, I'm troubled with that a little bit," he said. "There's
no question about it, the longer you feed the calf on the cow,
the longer it is to wean it."
    In recent months, USDA has offered subsidies on a growing
list of commodities to an increasing number of countries.
    Lyng called U.S. and European Community export subsidies
"just plain nonsensical as a long-term policy" and said he saw an
end to the expansion of the EEP.
    "I'm sure there's an end to the expansion, but we are doing
this to accomplish our goal which is to regain the markets that
we've lost, to keep our products competitive and to let those,
particularly the European Community, who, we are convinced, are
the worst offenders in terms of the export subsidization, that
we are prepared to continue to do this until we can come to
some agreement to put an end to it," he said.

<TITLE>SOVIET 1988 OIL OUTPUT TARGET AT 625 MLN TONNES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MOSCOW, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Soviet oil production target for 1988
has been set at 625 mln tonnes, a rise of eight mln tonnes over
this year's planned output.
    Oil Minister Vasily Dinkov announced the figure on Tuesday
at the Supreme Soviet, the country's nominal parliament.
    He said a new development strategy, fuller use of oil
deposits and better housing and pay for oilmen had allowed an
upsurge in the oil industry after three years of stagnation
which began in late 1983.
    Last year the Soviet Union produced 615 mln tonnes of oil,
slightly short of the target of 616.7 mln.
    January-September figures released at the weekend showed
Soviet oil output in the first nine months of this year at 467
mln tonnes. The 1987 target is 617 million.
    Dinkov said the Soviet Union would develop 38 new oil
deposits in the coming year. He called for speedier geolog
prospecting across the country to spur the oil industry.
    The Supreme Soviet convened on Monday to endorse the 1988
budget and plan. The session is expected to end on Tuesday.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson said the recent dispute between the United States and
West Germany over economic policy was responsible for much
financial turmoil and that it should never have happened.
    He said in a television interview the dispute had fanned
fears of a breakdown in the cooperation which is so important
between finance ministers of the major nations.
    He said the dispute was a row which should not have
happened and agreed that much of the blame lay with U.S.
Treasury Secretary James Baker who had publicly criticised West
Germany for having raised its key interest rates.

<TITLE>BAKER SEEN WINNING GERMAN INTEREST RATES BATTLE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Felix Dearden</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BONN, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States appears to have won a
transatlantic battle by forcing the Bundesbank to trim interest
rates, European economists said.
    But they added Washington set the stakes high by testing
the limits of the Louvre accord while global stock markets were
plunging.
    West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.
Treasury Secretary James Baker reaffirmed their commitment to
currency stability at a secret meeting yesterday in Frankfurt,
according to official statements released late Monday.
    Only 13 hours after the statements were released, the
Bundesbank reduced short-term interest rates by offering banks
liquidity at a fixed bid rate of 3.80 pct, down from a 3.85 pct
facility rate offered last week.
    While the two ministers were meeting with Bundesbank
president Karl Otto Poehl, the central bank had also added
money market liquidity repeatedly, signalling it did not want a
strong rise in the tender allocation rate on Tuesday.
     "It's round one to the Americans, " said Richard Reid,
senior European economist for brokers UBS/Philips and Drew in
London.
    But Reid added, "We shouldn't forget that it has taken one
of the biggest stock market crashes in decades to get the West
Germans to cut their security repurchase rate by a 0.05
percentage point."
    Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of earlier tightening
of West German monetary policy led to a sharp dollar fall and
fuelled speculation that the Louvre accord was no longer valid.
    Six leading industrial nations agreed under February's
Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies and coordinate monetary
policies. It has since been reaffirmed by the Group of Seven -
the US, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
    The Frankfurt meeting on Monday soothed currency markets
and the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours trading
in New York. At the Frankfurt fixing on Tuesday, the dollar was
quoted at 1.7918 marks compared with 1.7740 on Monday.
    Guenther Aschoff, chief economist at Deutsche
Genossenschaftbank in Frankfurt said massive declines on world
stock markets had been the main reason for the fall in West
German short-term interest rates on Tuesday.
    "The Bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock market
losses... That was the responsible thing to do and if it fits
with Baker's wishes, then all the better," he said.
    No central bank wants to let interest rates rise, and the
Bundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following rises
in the U.S., Aschoff said.
    Poehl told a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday the central
bank has no interest in higher capital market rates and he
thought the global rate increase was a cause for concern.
    Giles Keating, economist with Credit Suisse First Boston
Ltd in London said "The cautious Bundesbank has beaten a retreat
and Baker has won a battle...But he hasn't won the war as the
security repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it was
before the IMF meeting last month in Washington."
    Before the IMF meeting, when the Louvre Accord was
reaffirmed, the Bundesbank was offering money market liquidity
at 3.60 pct, Keating noted.
    Economists said the United States now appeared to have
agreed to play by the rules of the Louvre Accord and support
the dollar in return for the German action on interest rates.
    Any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinder
Washington's efforts to reduce its trade deficit, Stoltenberg
told a news conference on Tuesday. He added he would not rule
out central banks of leading industrial countries intervening
on exchange markets to defend the dollar's value.
    Deutsche Genossenschaftbank's Aschoff stressed West
Germany's heavy dependence on exports and the need for currency
stability. In addition, both the U.S. And West German central
banks were keen to avoid a dollar slide which would force them
to again spend vast sums intervening to support the dollar.

<TITLE>EC AGREES TRADE DEAL WITH ARGENTINA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community (EC) agreed a
trade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the country
following the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group, EC
officials said.
    Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers, Argentina
will gain additional trading rights on a series of products
including meat, fish and cereals by-products.
    But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals with
Canada and Japan and are due to study these again, the
officials said.
    The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of EC
states after West Germany withdrew objections to increased
quotas for Argentina on high-quality beef.
    Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat,
saying that the main dispute was over sales of cereals
substitutes, but they were outvoted by the other states, the
officials said. Under the deal, Argentina will benefit from
improved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular the
quota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4,500
tonnes to 34,300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will
be increased by 3,000 tonnes to 53,000 tonnes.
    Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of
5,000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced
levies on 550,000 tonnes of wheat bran, the officials said.
    The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina said
that Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected their
exports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. They
have been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade).
    But officials said ministers had been unable to resolve
Canadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain had
been affected by the country's EC membership.
    Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on the
fish dispute with Canada.
    Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan. The EC
claims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group has
improved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfied
with Japanese offers of compensation.
    Japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems on
citrus fruits to aid EC exports, to improve tariffs for some
other farm produce, to increase tariffs for leather footwear
and to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal.
    EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq told
journalists: "We maintain our position that the (Japanese)
concessions were not enough."
    "We hope that there will be an improvement," he said.

<TITLE>LAWSON SAYS UK INTEREST RATE PROSPECTS UNCHANGED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson said the collapse of British share prices this week held
no implication so far for domestic interest rates.
    He said in a television interview that "there is nothing in
the events of the past few days to increase the upward pressure
on (U.K.) interest rates."
    Sterling has so far stayed solid during the crisis, backed
by strong economic fundamentals and by 10 pct bank base lending
rates, analysts said. Lawson's comments followed another
frantic day in London's financial center, where British shares
closed 12.2 pct down on the day.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>West Virginia has been declared free
of tuberculosis and brucellosis from its cattle population, the
U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    It said a state is recognized as tuberculosis-free if no
case of the disease is diagnosed for at least five years and if
the state complies with the uniform methods and rules of the
state-federal cooperative eradication program.
    To achieve brucellosis-free status, a state's cattle
population must remain uninfected for the previous 12 months.
    There are 33 states, plus the U.S. Virgin Islands,
classified as free of bovine tuberculosis and 24 states, plus
Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which have eradicated
brucellosis. Only 20 states and the U.S. Virgin islands have
eradicated both diseases, it noted.

<TITLE>US SENATE CUTS OFF STALL TACTICS ON GULF BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Confronted by new hostilities
involving U.S. forces in the Gulf, the U.S. Senate voted to end
Republican stalling tactics and limit debate on a measure that
could give Congress a larger role in Gulf policy.
    The measure, however, does not require President Reagan to
comply with the 1973 War Powers Act as does a related Senate
bill. The controversial War Powers Act could require a pullout
of U.S. forces from the Gulf.
    The Senate voted 67-28 to stop a filibuster and limit
debate to 30 hours on a bipartisan measure that requires Reagan
to report to Congress on Gulf policy within 60 days and calls
for a resolution to be passed in the House and Senate on the
situation in the volatile waterway 30 days later.
    The resolution could be about any Gulf-related issue,
including an expression of support or of disapproval for
Reagan's policy of protecting 11 Kuwaiti tankers from Iran in
the waterway. The Pentagon said the 12th U.S.-protected convoy
began moving through the Gulf early Tuesday.

<TITLE>STOLTENBERG SAYS CRITICISM NOT "ONE-WAY STREET"</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said he
was surprised by recent criticism of West German economic
policies voiced by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker but
added that the criticism was not purely one-sided.
    Stoltenberg told the West German Trade and Industry
Association (DIHT) that before a meeting with Baker on Monday,
"There had been surprising notes of criticism (from the United
States)." He added. "Criticism is not a one-way street."
    He did not elaborate, but Bonn has often called on the U.S.
To reduce its federal budget deficit.
    Over the weekend Baker had criticised West German economic
policies, saying that rises in domestic interest rates here
were not in the spirit of last February's Louvre pact to
stabilise currencies.
    Stoltenberg told the DIHT that his meeting on Monday with
Baker had resolved differences between the two countries.
    At a news conference earlier on Tuesday Stoltenberg had
declined to comment specifically on Baker's criticisms, but he
had said that after three hours of discussions on Monday, "one
remark or another has been clarified."

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>US RULED OUT ATTACK ON IRANIAN SILKWORMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. military planners ruled out
Iran's Silkworm missiles as a target in the retaliatory attack
mounted on Monday for fear of being drawn more deeply into the
Iran-Iraq war, defense and Middle East experts said.
    U.S. naval forces destroyed an offshore oil platform and
raided another in what the administration called a "measured and
appropriate response" to an Iranian Silkworm missile attack last
Friday on a U.S.-flagged tanker in Kuwaiti waters.
    Private analysts generally agreed that going after the rig
rather than an onshore economic or military target such as
Silkworm launch sites reflected a careful bid by Washington to
limit the political, military and diplomatic fallout both at
home and in the Gulf.
    "It simply demonstrated the United States will take military
action when they (Iran) take military action," Norman Polmar, a
defense analyst and author, said.
    He said hitting the platforms had spared Iran the
embarrassment of casualties on its own soil, possibly avoiding
an escalating spiral of attack and counterattack.
    In addition, it minimized the risk to U.S. forces and the
potential embarrassment of any losses, including aircraft that
could have been shot down had they taken part in an attack.
    Anthony Cordesman, author of a new book on the Iran-Iraq
war, said the United States apparently chose a limited target
to keep alive the possibility that U.N. Secretary General
Javier Perez de Cuellar might still persuade Iran to accept a
Security Council call for a ceasefire.
    "We want the U.N. peace initiative to work if there's any
chance at all," he said, adding that the action made it clear
tougher steps would follow if Iran to attack Gulf shipping.

   In targeting an oil rig -- albeit one said by the Pentagon
to have been turned into a military command post -- Washington
also sent a message that it might be willing to attack Iran's
economic lifeline. Pentagon officials said the platform had
been used as a base for Iranian raids against shipping in the
lower Gulf.
    "We have chosen a military target, but we also have shown
Iran that we are willing to interfere with its oil-exporting
capabilities," Cordesman said.
    He predicted the United States would respond to any future
major Iranian challenges by hitting Iran's naval base at Bandar
Abbas on the Straits of Hormuz, followed by mining the
approaches to Iran's oil export terminal on Kharg Island.
    Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Monday the
United States did not seek further confrontation with Iran, "but
we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action
by Iran with stronger countermeasures."

<TITLE>SPAIN APPEALS FOR EC HELP ON MAIZE IMPORTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Spanish farm minister Carlos Romero,
speaking at a meeting of EC farm ministers, called for action
to help the Spanish maize market, Spanish diplomatic sources
said.
    Spain is threatened with massive imports from third
countries by the end of the year, they said.
    They said the imports are due to come in as a result of the
accord by which the EC has promised the United States it will
import two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum
into Spain from third countries this year.
    Around a sixth of this tonnage has so far come in under a
reduced levy system and the EC cereals management committee may
decide this week to authorise the Spanish intervention board to
make direct purchases.
    The sources said Romero urged that other EC countries
should take some of the imports to prevent disturbance of the
Spanish market.
    They said he threatened to withhold support for the EC
Commission plan for new limits on farm output which if breached
would mean price cuts unless Spain received some help.
    The sources said no direct reply was given to Romero at the
meeting.

<DATELINE>    ANCHORAGE, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas
lease sale number 97 in the Beaufort Sea, tentatively
schedualed for January 1988 has been postponed, the U.S.
Department of Interior said.
    Alan Powers, chief of the Minerals Maanagement Service for
the department, said the delay is to have more time to study
the effects of drilling noise on whale migrations.
    Powers said the state has asked for additional noise data
for the sale area off Alaska's North Slope. A new date has not
been set, but it will likely be no sooner than next March,
Powers said.
    Some 3,930 blocks encompassing about 21 mln acres are
involved in the proposed sale. The area is between three and
160 miles off the northern coast of Alaska in the Artic Ocean
between the Canadian border and 162 degrees west longitude.

Administration to take steps to reduce volatility in the

Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker to coordinate
international credit and montary policies among major nations

<DATELINE>    QUITO, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ecuador posted a trade deficit of 71.3 mln
dlrs in the first eight months of 1987, compared with a surplus
of 468.6 mln dlrs in the same period of 1986, central bank
figures show.
    Ecuador suspended oil exports, which made up 55 pct of the
value of its total exports in 1986, for five months this year
after an earthquake in March shattered the country's pipeline.
    The central bank said the value of exports from January to
August 1987 stood at 1.132 billion dlrs and imports 1.204
billion dlrs. Net international monetary reserves declined to
57.5 mln dlrs at end-September from 146.8 mln dlrs at end-
September 1986.

<TITLE>TELEX &lt;TC> ADOPTS SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DALLAS, Oct 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Telex Corp said its board adopted a
shareholder rights plan which will allow shareholders to
purchase one common share for two dlrs if a hostile group
acquires 15 pct or more of the company.
    However, the company said the plan will not be triggered by
purchases pursuant to the 65 dlrs a share tender offer
commenced on October 9 by a unit of TLX Partners, a group
controlled by New York financier Asher Edelman.
    It said the rights will be distributed on a one for one
basis to all shareholders as of October 30 and may be redeemed
before they become exercisable at five cents per right.
    The company said the rights will expire on the later of
February 17 next year or 60 days from the date they become
exercisable. It said the plan was intended to protect
stockholders against any attempt to take unfair advantage of
the recent decline in stock prices or to use abusive tactics
such as market accumulations which would interfere with its
ability to maximize stockholder value.
    The rights become exercisable if any person or group
acquires 15 pct or more of the company's common stock other
than through an all cash tender offer for all outstanding
shares at 65 dlrs per share.
     It said the rights will also not become exercisable if the
company is acquired by a group under an agreement made with its
board.
     A spokeswoman told Reuters the company would have an
official response to Edelman's bid by Friday, Oct 23.

<TITLE>SPHINX MINING &lt;SPNXF.O> FINDS GOLD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FORT SMITH, Ark., Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sphinx Mining Inc said leased
mining claims in Alaska could produce revenues between 322 mln
dlrs and 966 mln dlrs from gold reserves.
    The range of the value of the reserves is attributed to the
wide range of grade estimates of the ore, the company said.
    A 1984 feasibility study put the grade at 0.008 ounces per
cubic yard, while subsequent exploration work proved that areas
of higher-grade gravel of up to 0.027 ounces/yard do exist,
Sphinx said.
    The claims are located 80 miles northwest of Fairbanks.

<TITLE>SAUDI ROLE IN GULF PRAISED BY U.S. OFFICIALS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Abdullah
bin Abdul Aziz was thanked by the Reagan administration for his
country's close, and closed-mouthed, cooperation with
Washington in the Gulf, a senior U.S. official said.
    "The Saudis are being very cooperative. It would be nice if
the Saudis would go more public, but it's their real estate,"
said the official who asked not to be named.
    He declined to describe what sort of help the Saudis were
providing, saying that Saudi officials are reluctant to
acknowledge their role in the Gulf where the United States has
stationed forces to protect shipping lanes.
    The prince met Vice President George Bush on Monday after
U.S. naval forces attacked offshore Iranian oil platforms in
what Washington said was retaliation for an Iranian attack on a
ship moored off Kuwait and flying the U.S. flag.
    Asked at the start of the meeting how he felt about the
attack, the prince, who is here on an official visit, replied,
"I believe what the United States has done is their
responsibility as a superpower."
    The senior U.S. official said his remark was an endorsement
of the U.S. attack.

<TITLE>BANK OF NEW YORK REAFFIRMS TERMS FOR IRVING &lt;V></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of New York Corp &lt;BK> said it
reaffirmed the terms of its offer for Irving Bank Corp despite
the drop in the Bank of New York's share price to 30-1/8, a
Bank of New York spokesman said.
    "The offer still stands, we have not changed our offer," a
Bank of New York spokesman said.
    Irving would not comment on how the drop in the market
affects its position on the bid or whether it would buy back
any of its own shares.
    Earlier this month, Irving rejected the bid as inadequate
and said it wanted to retain its independence.
    In late September, Bank of New York offered 80 dlrs per
share in cash for 47.4 pct of Irving. For the remaining 52.6
pct, it offered an exchange of 1.9 shares of its shares for one
Irving share.
    At that time, the stock purchase portion was worth close to
80 dlrs per share, but now that portion is worth 53 dlrs per
share for a net price of 68 dlrs, one analyst said.
    According to the prospectus offer, shareholders may tender
for all cash or all shares on a first come, first serve basis.
    Analysts were mixed about how the stock price drop would
affect the acquisition.
    "If it gets to the Irving shareholders, they would approve
it, but Irving hopes the offer won't go to the shareholders,"
said Mark Alpert, banking analyst with Bear Stearns Cos Inc.
    "And the market is saying the deal won't go through,"
Alpert said.
    "The transaction looks highly unlikely to be completed at
present. If Irving wouldn't go with the offer at 80 dlrs a
share, then they won't go at a lower price," another analyst
said.
    The analyst also doubted that Bank of New York could afford
to retain its original offer.
    However, industry sources were more uncertain about
prospects for the deal.
    "With Irving's price so low, Bank of New York's offer will
look good to Irving shareholders," said Michael Flores, a
consultant at Bank Earnings International, a consulting firm.
    The drop of Irving's share to 44 dlrs per share, which is
about a 26 dlr drop from the beginning of last week, increases
the chance that Bank of New York will succeed, Flores said.
    Analysts said that the drop in bank stock prices is likely
to depress the level of mergers and acquisition in the banking
industry.
    "Bank takeovers are less likely because banks can't use
their own stock to make acquisitions because their share price
is too depressed," Alpert said.
    Since only banks can buy another bank, the only other
possible acquirors would be a foreign bank, Alpert said.
    "In the market drop the stock of acquirors got clobbered
more than the acquirees," another analyst said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The State Department says many U.S.
diplomatic missions overseas are on high alert for possible
retaliation from Iran for Monday's attack on two Iranian oil
platforms by American forces in the Gulf.
    At the same time, the Pentagon announced on Tuesday that
U.S. forces have begun escorting another Kuwaiti tanker convoy
southward through the Gulf from Kuwait.
    The State Department renewed its warning to Americans not
to travel to Iran because of what spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley
called, "its virulent anti-American policies and support for
terrorism."
    "The threat to Americans has increased significantly," she
said in announcing that the department was reiterating advice
it last made in January. The department said about 2,600
American citizens live in Iran, the overwhelming majority dual
nationalities.
    Oakley said no specific warning has been issued to U.S.
diplomats and Americans living abroad in the aftermath of the
U.S. attack on the oil drilling platforms, but "many of our
missions are on a high state of alert."

<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil's September trade surplus
was the best so far this year, totalling 1.494 billion dlrs,
compared with 1.434 billion dlrs in August and 540 mln dlrs in
September last year, Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade Department
(Cacex) director Namir Salek said in a news conference.
    September exports were 2.694 billion dlrs, slightly down
from 2.76 billion dlrs in August. Imports in September amounted
to 1.2 billion dlrs, against 1.32 billion dlrs in August.
    Salek said the accumulated surplus in the Jan-Sept period
was 7.857 billion dlrs, compared with 8.667 billion dlrs in a
similar 1986 period.
    Coffee accounted with 320 mln dlrs of exports, up from 222
mln dlrs in August and 212 mln in September 1986, Salek said.
    The Cacex director said he expected the country's trade
surplus to average 800 mln dlrs in the remaining three months
of the year, estimating the year's overall surplus to reach
10.2 billion dlrs, from 25.6 billion dlrs worth of exports and
15.4 billion dlrs of imports.
    He attributed the good surplus on exports of manufactured
and semimanufactured goods. He mentioned car exports, which
accounted alone with sales of 617 mln dlrs in the Jan-Sept
period, against 194 mln dlrs in a similar 1986 period.

<TITLE>TREASURY'S BAKER UNDER FIRE FOR WALL STREET DROP</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alver Carlson</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>As official Washington sought to
restore investor confidence after Monday's Wall Street
collapse, Treasury Secretary James Baker came under fire from
critics who claimed he helped to precipitate the crisis.
    Baker's weekend blast at the West German Bundesbank for
boosting interest rates seemed to signal an unraveling of an
international accord to stabilize currency values.
    Nigel Lawson, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, was
among those who said the treasury secretary's statements helped
spur a wave of stock sales by making already jittery investors
think that a clash between the two major economic powers would
damage the world economy.
    Lawson told a London television interviewer Tuesday, "I
think the scale of the (stock) fall was very great. That, I
think, was partly due to statements that have been made by
senior figures on the other side of the Atlantic." It was a
dispute that should never have happened, he added.
    Although Baker appeared to patch over the rift at a
hastily-called meeting with West German officials Monday, he  
still faced a storm of criticism on his return to the United
States on Tuesday. Baker cut short a long-planned trip to
Scandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis.
    Said one U.S. analyst of Baker's weekend remarks, "His
timing could not have been worse."
    One government bond salesman in New York said, "He actually
thought that yelling at the Germans, and threatening to smack
the dollar down would work. That doesn't show much
understanding of international monetary gamesmanship."
    However, some analysts said West Germany's stubborn march
toward higher interest rates may have forced Baker's hand.
    "On the surface Baker may look responsible for this, but if
you go back to see what caused it (unsettling of financial
markets), it was West German policy," said Robert Brusca of
Nikko Securities International in New York.
    "All Mr. Baker did was to mention the obvious in public, so
making him responsible for it was a little like killing the
messenger," he said.
    After Monday's talks, the U.S. and West German governments
made it clear that the Louvre currency accord, pieced together
in Paris in February, was still in effect.
    Wall Street feared that collapse of the agreement might be
a prelude to hyper-inflation and economic malaise similar to
the late 1970s. Analysts believe Monday's Wall Street crash
wiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values.
   Treasury sources said that Baker, already unhappy about
Bonn's refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep the
global recovery moving, was angered by a Bundesbank interest
rate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite.
    He felt that the U.S. recovery, inching along in its 59th
month, could no longer be the only engine of global economic
expansion. A growing U.S. economy has been serving as a huge
market for debtor country exports.
    Moreover, Baker, the consummate politician, was worried
that the Republican party might face next year's presidential
election with its main showpiece -- a vibrant economy -- badly
tarnished.
    A rise in global interest rates might worsen the debt
crisis and completely choke off U.S. economic growth that has
already slowed to a tepid 3.2 pct annual rate.
    "There's no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on the
economy, and it's important that the psychology turn around
quickly, or else obviously the panic will feed on itself, and
eventually there'll be a serious price to pay economically,"
former deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman said in a
television interview.
    In many ways, the official response was mild.
    Washington was stunned by the sudden Wall Street retreat,
with President Reagan speaking for most people by admitting
that he was "puzzled."
    U.S. government sources said the secretary immediately
returned to the Treasury to be briefed on market developments
and, presumably, their political impact.
    For all of this, it seems unlikely that Baker's status in
Washington will diminish because of the market fall.
    Asked by reporters if somebody's head should roll because
of the Wall Street retreat, Texas Democratic Senator Lloyd
Bentsen said with some irony, "Oh, I think it's much too late to
be doing that...You have an administration that's taken the
attitude that we can put the country on automatic pilot and ---
retire to the living room to take a nap. You just can't do
that."

<TITLE>REAGAN SEES ROOM FOR INTEREST RATE DECLINES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan said he was pleased
with the actions of some banks to reduce their prime lending
rates today and said he sees room for a further decline in
interest rates.
    "I believe there is room in the market for a further decline
in interest rates," Reagan said in a statement as he left the
White House to visit his wife Nancy at Bethesda Naval Hospital.
    Reagan's statement followed a meeting with his top economic
advisers.
    Reagan said he remains concerned about the market, but that
actions taken by the Federal Reserve have helped.
    "Interest rates are down across the spectrum," Reagan said.
    "Specifically, I am pleased that the bond market is strong
and that foreign exchange markets are stable," Reagan said.

<TITLE>DART GROUP DROPS DAYTON HUDSON &lt;DH> TAKEOVER BID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dart Group Corp &lt;DARTA.O> affiliate
Madison Partners said that given current market conditions it
has dropped its takeover bid for Dayton Hudson Corp.
    The company said it sold 1.4 mln of its 4.6 mln shares of
Dayton Hudson stock.
    It said it intends to sell the rest of its Dayton Hudson
shares. At current market levels, it would suffer a 70 mln dlr
aftertax loss on its holding, a spokesman said.
    Dart said it will not solicit authorization to call a
meeting of Dayton Hudson shareholders.
    Dart had offered to buy Dayton Hudson for 68 dlrs per
share, valuing the Minneapolis based retailer at 6.6 billion
dlrs. That offer was rejected by the company.
    Following the selloff in takeover stocks last week, and the
market's decline this week, Dayton Hudson stock closed at
27-1/2 today, off 2-1/2.
    Dart's holdings amounted to just under five pct of Dayton
Hudson.
    A Dart spokesman said the 1.4 mln shares were sold in the
market today.

<TITLE>CONVOY RUNS GULF GAUNTLET, OTHER SHIPS STAY CLEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>A new convoy of tankers escorted by
American warships headed down the Gulf on Wednesday, towards
Iranian oil platforms still oozing smoke after having being
blasted by U.S. Navy raiders.
    Some Gulf sea captains were reported to be steering well
clear of Iran's Silkworm missiles, however, and frontline
emirate Kuwait redeployed air defences to counter the threat.
    "I think the predominant feeling ... Is of being scared this
conflict will escalate," a top West German Foreign Ministry
official, Helmut Schaefer, told reporters in Bahrain after a
tour of three Gulf states.
b
    Shipping sources said on Tuesday night at least six sea
captains had voiced fears that Iran would avenge Monday's U.S.
Raids by unleashing more Silkworm missiles at ships plying the
Gulf.
    Belgium decided two minesweepers en route for the Gulf
would stay out for the time being following Monday's U.S.
Action.
    But there was no sign that the prospect of more tit-for-tat
assaults had reduced the level of shipping activity in the
area.
    Iran, having vowed to react strongly after Monday's U.S.
Action, launched a barrage of threats and ridicule.
    For its part, Washington warned Iran again on Tuesday that
it was ready for any further hostile action.
    Pentagon officials then announced that a U.S. Guided
missile destroyer began escorting two Kuwaiti tankers flying
the U.S. flag southwards--the 80,000 tonne product carrier
Ocean City and 46,000 tonne petroleum tanker Gas King.

<TITLE>ARTILLERY SHELLS SAID TO FALL ON KUWAIT BORDER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KUWAIT, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Artillery shells from an exchange of fire
between Iran and Iraq fell on Kuwait's northern border on
Tuesday but caused no casualties, the Kuwait News Agency KUNA
said, quoting a Defense Ministry official.
    There were rumors in world oil markets on Tuesday that Iran
had fired shells at an oil camp in northern Kuwait in
retaliation for U.S. Attacks on Iranian oil platforms in the
Gulf on Monday. "Several shells fell in a random manner on the
northern border of the country," the official told KUNA. "It
seems these shells arose from an exchange of fire between Iran
and Iraq... No one was wounded and there were no losses."
    Diplomats said shells from the nearby Iran-Iraq warfront
had in the past fallen in the northern Kuwaiti desert.
    A senior Kuwait Petroleum Corporation official had earlier
told Reuters he was unaware of any attack against Kuwaiti oil
installations.

<TITLE>U.S. MAY END ADDITIONAL SANCTIONS AGAINST JAPAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States may lift an
additional 84 mln dlrs in trade sanctions against Japan later
this month, Reagan Administration officials said.
    President Reagan imposed 300 mln dlrs in sanctions on
Japanese goods last April for its failure to honor a 1986
agreement to end dumping semiconductors in the U.S. and third
country markets and to open its home market to U.S. goods.
    The move raised tariffs to 100 pct from about five pct on
Japanese color television sets, hand-held power tools and
portable computers.
    Reagan lifted 51 mln dlrs of the sanctions last June  after
Japan ended selling the semiconductors on the U.S. market at
below production costs.
    Semiconductors are the small silicon chips used for memory
and recall purposes in a wide variety of computers.
    The Administration officials said Commerce Department 
monitors showed that Japan was ending its dumping of the
semiconductors in third countries, where they had been taking
sales away from American-made semiconductors.
    They said it was likely the 51 mln dlrs in sanctions would
be lifted by the end of the month.
    The United States and Japan remain at odds over opening the
closed Japanese markets to U.S. goods.
    U.S. and Japanese officials reviewed Japan's compliance
with the agreement earlier this week.
    The periodic reviews are to continue and the remaining
sanctions to stay in force, the officials said, until Japan is
in full compliance with the semiconductor agreement.

<TITLE>CANADIAN PACIFIC (CP) UNIT STUDIES PULP MILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     MONTREAL, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>CIP Inc, wholly-owned by Canadian
Pacific Ltd, is considering building a pulp mill in Texas which
would use kenaf fibre instead of wood, CIP president Cecil
Slenniken said in an interview.
     The kenaf plant is a member of the hibiscus family and was
artificially developed several years ago. The plant, which has
been grown in Southern Texas, reaches a height of 10 feet in
three months and is said to produce better quality newsprint
than wood pulp, a CIP official said.
     Slenniken said the company has commissioned studies for a
200,000 tonne capacity pulp mill which would use the fibre but
would need partners to begin the project.
    "We are not yet ready to commit the hundreds of millions of
dollars it would take for such a project," Slenniken said.
     He said CIP has been using the pulp on a trial basis to
make newsprint containing 90 pct kenaf fibre and 10 pct
softwood fibre at its Trois-Rivieres, Quebec plant.
    CIP, Canada's second largest newsprint producer, recently
launched a 366 mln Canadian dlr newsprint mill at Gold River,
British Columbia which is due begin producing 230,000 metric
tonnes per year by fall of 1989.

<TITLE>REAGAN SAYS U.S. COMMITTED TO LOUVRE ACCORD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan said the United
States remains committed to the Louvre accord in which the
seven major industrial nations agreed to stabilize currency
exchange rates.
    "The United States remains committed to the Louvre
agreement," Reagan said in a statement following a meeting with
his top economic advisers.
    Reagan said the United States, Japan and West Germany had
all reaffirmed their commitment to coordinate economic
policies.
    Reagan said Japanese Prime Minister-designate Noboru
Takeshita said in a telephone conversation Tuesday morning that
"his (Takeshita's) top priority was to maintain stable economic
relations with the United States."
    Reagan noted that Treasury Secretary James Baker met with
West German financial officials and reaffirmed their commitment
to the Louvre agreement.
    They "reaffirmed our agreement to coordinate economic
policies to provide for non-inflationary growth and stable
exchange rates," Reagan said.

<TITLE>SOUTHLAND &lt;SLC> TARGETED IN SEC INVESTIGATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Southland Corp said it was told the 
Securities and Exchange Commission ordered a private
investigation into Southland stock trading and statements made
by the company this year.
    "Southland has been advised that the Commission has issued
a private order of investigation concerning the trading of
Southland stock during various times in 1987 and the issuance
of various public statements by Southland," Southland said in a
proxy statement to shareholders.
    Southland did not elaborate on the SEC order of
investigation, and company officials could not be reached for
comment late Tuesday.
    The SEC has a long-standing policy against confirming or
denying the existence of investigations.
    The proxy statement, filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, is required for a November 5 shareholders meeting
called to approve the previously announced acquisition of
Southland by a company controlled by Southland chairman John
Thompson and members of his family.
    Earlier this year, a group led by Thompson acquired
majority ownership of Southland through a 77 dlrs a share
tender offer for 31.5 mln shares of Southland common stock.
    If the merger is approved, common stock still outstanding
will be converted into the right to receive 61.32 dlrs a share
in cash plus a fraction of a share of preferred stock.

<TITLE>EDELMAN GROUP COMMITTED TO TELEX &lt;TC> BID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>TLX Partners, a group led by Asher
Edelman, does not see any problems with its 65 dlr per share
bid for Telex Corp, a Shearson Lehman official advising the
group said.
    Several other takeover proposals have crumbled following
declines in financial markets, leading to speculation that
Edelman might also drop his offer. Telex fell 11 to 34-1/4.
    Earlier today, Carl Icahn dropped his bid to take Trans
World Airlines Inc &lt;TWA> private and Dart Group Corp &lt;DARTA.O>
said it abandoned plans to acquire Dayton Hudson Corp &lt;DH>.
    Both cited market conditions.
    "Nothing fundamental has changed with the company. The
stock price has changed, but the company hasn't changed so
there's no reason for us to change," said Daniel Good, head of
Shearson Lehman merchant banking.
    "Things are proceeding as planned, and we fully expect that
at the time we have to pay for the shares the financing will be
in place," Good said.
    Shearson has agreed to provide bridge financing of up to 
600 mln dlrs for the Edelman group.

<TITLE>SENATE BACKS U.S. RETALIATION IN GULF</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Senate on Tuesday backed
President Reagan's retaliatory strike against Iranian targets
in the Gulf as it moved to take a greater role in making policy
in the volatile region.
    Senators voted 92-1 for a non-binding measure that endorsed
Monday's U.S. attack on two Iranian oil platforms in
retaliation for an Iranian attack last Friday on a Kuwaiti ship
flying the American flag.
    The measure said the attack was a firm indication of U.S.
resolve that Iran "cannot take military action against the
United States with impunity."
    Earlier, the Senate cut off Republican stalling tactics and
set a vote on a measure that could give Congress a larger role
in making Gulf policy. The measure, however, does not require
Reagan to comply with the 1973 War Powers Act, which could lead
to a pullout of U.S. forces from the Gulf.
    While Democrats and Republicans praised the U.S.
retaliatory strike, many voiced new fears about the growing
U.S. involvement in the Gulf and some demanded that Reagan
comply with the War Powers Act.

<TITLE>CANADA SEEKS FIVE YEAR FARM REFORM PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canada will propose at the new round of
international trade talks that most trade-distorting farm
subsidies be phased out over a five year period, Trade Minister
Pat Carney said.
    "Agricultural subsidies and trade barriers have created a
vicious circle which continues to cause problems of
overproduction and low commodity prices," Carney told the House
of Commons.
    Carney was outlining the government's new position on the
farm trade problem that was tabled on Tuesday in Geneva in the
multilateral talks under the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade).
    While few details were released, Carney said the government
would also be pressing for an improvement in market access and
new measures to ensure countries do not erect artificial
barriers.
    "Under the Canadian proposal, all countries would have to
ensure that domestic policies and programs to address the
specific needs of their farm sectors do not distort trade," a
government background paper said.
    "Furthermore, in assessing the trade impact of programs,
credit could be given to countries which effectively control
the output of farm products," the papers said.

<TITLE>US SAYS CANADIAN, ISRAELI PACTS SHOULD SPUR TRADE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter
said on Monday that the U.S. free trade agreements with Canada
and Israel should help to pave the way for liberalizing the
global trading system.
    He said the Canadian and Israeli pacts will not set back
worldwide reform efforts under the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT) as some critics feared but help them.
    The GATT talks began a year ago in Punta del Este, Uruguay
to liberalize the global trading system and to include in it
trade in agriculture and services such as banking.
    Yeutter made his remarks at a U.S.-Israeli trade meeting
marking the second year of their bilateral accord. The
Canadian-U.S. pact, signed by two sides two weeks ago, has yet
been approved by the U.S. Congress and Canadian Parliament.
    The two free trade agreements (FTA) would gradually remove
tariffs and other barriers to cross-border trade in goods and
many services.
    Yeutter said in the aftermath of the Canadian and Israeli
pacts "other countries have realized that if they want to
continue to have access to the world's largest market, they had
better get serious about improving the GATT."
    The pact with Israel, he said, is gradually increasing
shipments both ways and the Canadian pact will substantially
increase the gross national products in both countries.
    Yeutter also said the Canadian and Israeli pacts should
serve as important precedents for progress in GATT.
    Yeutter said, "increasing trade is one of the keys to
enhanced political and economic stability around the globe."
    He said, "a stronger GATT will enhance prosperity, not only
for advanced industrial nations, but also for other countries
that need to increase trade in order to better their standards
of living."
    Yeutter added it was important not to risk the progress
made in the Israeli and Canadian trade pacts by resorting to
protectionism.
    He was referring to trade legislation pending in Congress
that would force the United States to take retaliatory actions
against nations with large trade surpluses with the United
States if the countries practiced unfair trade.
    The legislation was prompted by a growing U.S. trade
deficit that hit 156 billion dlrs last year and is still
rising.
    Yeutter said the pressures for Congress to act were hard to
resist, but the pending legislation would undermine President
Reagan's efforts to liberalize the world trade.
    Yeutter renewed the threat of a White House veto.
    He said, "President Reagan will veto any bill that contains
serious flaws, and I believe that veto would be sustained."

<TITLE>BAKER/STOLTENBERG MEETING SOOTHES MARKETS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jonathan Lynn and Anthony Williams</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>News of a meeting between U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker and West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg on Monday soothed currency markets, allowing the
dollar to recoup much of the day's losses, dealers said.
    News of the meeting, which took place in Frankfurt in great
secrecy, came after the dollar fell sharply on criticism by
Baker of West German monetary policy, which had provoked fears
that the Louvre pact on currency stability was in jeopardy.
    The dollar reacted immediately to the news, rising over two
pfennigs in after hours New York trading, dealers there said.
    The announcement of the meeting, also attended by
Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, was made simultaneously
in Bonn and Washington, timed for after the closure of New York
markets.
    Baker, Stoltenberg and Poehl agreed to pursue the policies
accepted under the February Louvre accord, a finance ministry
spokesman in Bonn said.
    The dollar rose to 1.7970/90 marks from New York's close of
1.7730/40. It had closed there on Friday at 1.7975/85 marks.
    The dollar had tumbled nearly three pfennigs as the market
reacted to Baker's criticism of rising West German interest
rates, and stock markets crashed worldwide. Baker had said that
West Germany was apparently breaching the Louvre accord.
    Under the accord, leading industrial democracies pledged to
coordinate economic policies to foster currency stability, with
the surplus countries, West Germany and Japan, stimulating
their economies and the U.S. promising to cut its budget
deficit.
    West German government sources said rising West German
money market rates could not be seen as a breach of the Louvre
pact. They were rather a direct reaction to higher interest
rates in the United States. U.S. Bond yields have been rising
since May on inflationary fears and in early September the Fed
raised the discount rate to 6.00 pct from 5.50.
    German yields have also risen over this period, but less
markedly, and since late September the Bundesbank has nudged up
short-term rates by changing the terms on its security
repurchase pacts, its principal instrument for steering the
money market.
    The allocation rate on the last facility was 3.85 pct,
compared with 3.60 pct. This was partly due to West Germany's
inability to uncouple itself from U.S. interest rate trends,
but also reflected concern among monetary conservatives in the
Bundesbank central bank council about excessive monetary
growth, which raised fears of domestically produced inflation,
bank economists said.
    This monetary tightening reflected a switch from the
pragmatic line pursued by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl
since early this year to stabilise the mark externally, to the
more cautious approach of Vice President Helmut Schlesinger.
    In an apparent gesture to Baker, coinciding with his visit,
the Bundesbank repeatedly added money market liquidity this
morning. Dealers said this was clearly a move to appease U.S.
anger over the most recent West German interest rate rises.
    "They (the Bundesbank) just don't want to come too much
under American fire," said Chris Zwermann, currency adviser at
Swiss Bank Corp here.
    "It seems to me that this is the Bundesbank beating quite a
significant retreat from its position," added Giles Keating,
economist at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London.
    The significance that retreat will emerge from the terms of
the Bundesbank's next tender for a securities repurchase pact
on Tuesday, and its result on Wednesday, money market
economists said.
    Today's injection of liquidity shows that the Bundesbank
does not want a further strong rise in the tender allocation
rate, which is likely to turn out at between 3.80 and 3.90 pct,
little changed from the 3.85 pct on the last facility.
    The Bundesbank and Finance Ministry had given no indication
that the meeting would take place, although the Finance
Ministry spokesman said it had been arranged last week.
    Earlier on Monday the Finance Ministry spokesman, asked to
comment on the apparent U.S.-German clash over the Louvre
accord, went no further than quoting Stoltenberg as saying he
assumed monetary cooperation would continue.
    The spokesman said he believed Baker had already left West
Germany for Sweden on Monday. This week he is also due to visit
Denmark and Belgium.

<TITLE>EX-ARCO &lt;ARC> CHIEF SEES ENERGY CRISIS BY 1990</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dwindling global crude oil reserves and
the lack of any major new discoveries in recent years will send
the world into an energy crisis by 1990, the former Atlantic
Richfield Co chairman Robert O. Anderson said.
    "It's going to come sooner than anyone thinks," Anderson
told reporters after addressing a Houston business lunch. "I
believe we're going to see a change in the world oil markets in
two to three years because oil is becoming harder to find."
    Anderson, who retired from Arco last year to form Hondo Oil
and Gas Co, said world oil consumption is approaching 60 mln
barrels a day but a current excess capacity cushion of about
4.5 mln barrels a day will rapidly disappear.
    "If you looked around the world, you could not scrape up
one mln barrels a day in shut-in production outside the Middle
East," he said. "We're soon going to be right back where we
were in 1973 and 1979."
    Anderson predicted that world oil prices would end 1987 at
about 24 dlrs a barrel and continue a gradual climb.
    "There's no way prices can stay flat because there isn't
enough supply," he said. "There have been no major oil
discoveries for the past 15 to 20 years."
    Alaska's Prudhoe Bay oil reserves, the last major world
discovery, has already produced about five billion barrels of
oil or more than half of its estimated reserves, he said.

<DATELINE>    BRASILIA, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil will only lift the partial
moratorium on its 113-billion-dlr foreign debt after an accord
is reached with the private banks, the Finance Ministry said in
a statement.
    The statement said such agreement, currently being
negotiated, must place the debt "within the terms proposed by
Brazil on September 25."
    Brazil proposed to the private creditors a refinancing of
the interest on its foreign debt that have expired or will
expire up to 1989, totalling an overall 10.4 billion dlrs.
    Brazil also proposed the end of spreads and conversion into
bonds of part of the 70-billion dlrs owed to private banks.
    Brazil in February stopped interest payments on about 68
billion dlrs owed to private banks, and the Ministry statement
issued on Monday said this would only be lifted "when an accord
is reached."
    The statement said that a token payment, which banks want
from the Brazil as a condition to discuss an agreement, "will
only be made when there is a major progress in the
negotiations."
    Meanwhile, a World Bank mission arrived on Monday to
analyse the performance of the Brazilian economy after the new
plan launched in July by Finance Minister Luiz Carlos Bresser
Pereira.

<TITLE>VENEZUELA BACKS INCREASE IN ECUADOR OPEC QUOTA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CARACAS, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Venezuela will back Ecuador's bid to
raise its OPEC quota above 221,000 barrels per day (bpd)
because it is a justifiable demand, Venezuelan Energy Minister
Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said on Monday.
    He told reporters the country deserved a higher quota in
compensation for the five months it was forced to suspend oil
production when its main pipeline was destroyed by an
earthquake last March.
    "For this five-month period, Ecuador did not exercise its
right to produce 221,000 bpd," he said. "We should recognize
Ecuador's right to increase its quota ... There is a basis of
justice in that country's petition."
    He added however, the quota increase should be gradual to
avoid harming the market, he added.
    Hernandez Grisanti said he understood Ecuador would
formally submit the request for a higher quota at the next
ministerial conference of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) opening December 9 in Vienna.

<TITLE>U.S., AT U.N., CLAIMS SELF-DEFENSE FOR GULF ATTACK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    UNITED NATIONS, Oct 19 -</DATELINE><BODY>The United States invoked the right
of self-defense in destroying an Iranian oil platform in the
Gulf, the American delegation told the United Nations.
    Lieutenant General Vernon Walters sent letters about the
incident to Security Council President Maurizio Bucci, the
delegate of Italy, and Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar.
    U.N. press secretary Francois Giuliani said the Secretary
General had no comment on the attack, which followed his appeal
last Friday for restraint in the crisis while he pursued
efforts to obtain a ceasefire between Iran and Iraq.
    In his explanation, Walters said the United States took
defensive action in response to an Iranian attack against
American ships in the Gulf.
    He cited an Iranian Silkworm missile strike last Friday in
Kuwait waters against the United States-flag ship Sea Isle
City.
    Walters said that military forces on the destroyed Iranian
platform had engaged in a variety of actions against United
States-flag and other nonbelligerent vessels and planes.
    "In accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations
(Charter), I wish, on behalf of my government, to report that
United States forces have exercised the inherent right of
self-defense under internation law by taking defensive action
in response to attacks by . . . Iran against United States
vessels in the Gulf," Walters said.
    Members of the Security Council met behind closed doors on
Monday to discuss developments in the Gulf war, but no
statement was issued afterwards.

<DATELINE>    PARIS, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>France voiced its comprehension for a U.S.
Attack on an Iranian target while calling for a swift halt to
the Gulf War to avoid further escalation.
    "The French authorities reaffirm their attachment to the
freedom and security of navigation and to the right of all
states to take action under international law and the United
Nations charter to halt attacks such as that of October 16," the
Foreign Ministry spokesman said in a statement.
    The United States said its forces destroyed an Iranian oil
platform in the Gulf and struck at a second on Monday in
retaliation for a recent Iranian missile attack on a
U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti ship.
    Washington said the platforms were used to monitor shipping
and to launch small-boat attacks on shipping. The French
statement described the target as "an Iranian military platform."
    But the French statement added that "everything must be done
now to avoid that these military developments lead to a new
escalation of the conflict."

<TITLE>U.S. LAWMAKERS SUPPORT GULF ACTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>American lawmakers rallied behind
President Reagan for the U.S. strike against Iranian targets in
the Gulf but the attack fueled a sharp new White House-Congress
debate over limits on his powers to make war.
    The Pentagon announced on Monday that U.S. warships
destroyed a non-producing oil platform used for monitoring Gulf
ship traffic and military operations, and also raided a second
Iranian oil rig in retaliation for an earlier Iranian attack on
a Kuwaiti ship flying the American flag.
    Many Democrats, who control Congress, and Republicans
expressed support for the attack and praised it as an
appropriate "measured response."
    But Democrats and liberal Republicans voiced new fears that
the growing confrontation between Tehran and the United States
could erupt into a major war, and demanded that Reagan comply
with the 1973 War Powers Act, which could lead to a pullout of
American forces from the waterway.
    "Those who contend the strike was necessary must realize
their words are easily construed as a tacit endorsement of war
with Iran," said Sen Mark Hatfield of Oregon, a Republican.

Lawson welcomed on Monday the reaffirmation by the U.S. And
West Germany of the Louvre accord aimed at stabilising
currencies.
    His office said Lawson had welcomed the outcome of a
meeting between U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker, Bundesbank
President Karl Otto Poehl, and West German Finance Minister
Gerhard Stoltenberg in Frankfurt.
    After the meeting, a Bonn finance ministry spokesman quoted
Stoltenberg as saying he was confident that foreign currencies
could be stabilised at around current levels.
    The meeting came after Baker criticised West Germany for
increasing key interest rates, saying they were not in line
with last February's Louvre accord.

<TITLE>ITALY WORRIED AT RISING TENSION AFTER GULF ATTACK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Italian Prime Minister Giovanni Goria told
the cabinet on Monday he was worried about the increased
tension in the Gulf, but said America's retaliation against
Iran had been limited.
    A statement issued after a cabinet meeting said Goria had
been informed by the United States that it would take action
against an Iranian target in the Gulf, but had not known
beforehand that the action would involve an attack on an oil
platform.
    "The prime minister expressed his concern over the possible
consequences of increased tension in the Gulf, at the same time
recognizing the limited character of the American military
reaction to the attacks it has suffered in the past few days,"
the statement said.
    Goria said Italy's own ships were far from the platform at
the time of the attack and the fleet had been advised to follow
events with caution.
    Italy has sent eight ships, including three frigates and
three minesweepers, to the Gulf to protect Italian merchant
shipping there.

<TITLE>MEDIA GENERAL &lt;MEGA> FAMILY WONT SELL SHARES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RICHMOND, Va., Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Media General Inc's chairman, D.
Tennant Bryant, said his family would not sell its controlling
share block, so it would be impossible for an investor group
led by &lt;Giant Group Ltd> to gain control of the company.
    The investor group, which includes Barris Industries
&lt;BRRS.O>, recently reported that it acquired a 9.8 pct stake of
Media General's class A shares and might seek control.
    Bryant said the company's class A stock elects only 30 pct
of the board, with the remaining 70 pct being elected by class
B shares, two-thirds of which are controlled by the Bryant
family trust, which has no intention of selling its shares.

<TITLE>BONN CONFIDENT OF MAINTAINING CURRENCY STABILITY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker met West
German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank
President Karl Otto Poehl in Frankfurt on Monday, a Bonn
Finance Ministry spokesman said.
    After the meeting the spokesman quoted Stoltenberg as
saying he was confident that foreign currencies could be
stabilised at around current levels.
    The meeting came after Baker criticised West Germany for
increasing short-term money market interest rates. He had said
the rise was not in line with the spirit of the Louvre accord
aimed at stabilizing the U.S. dollar last February.
    The meeting had been arranged last week, the spokesman
said. Baker, Stoltenberg and Poehl had agreed to pursue the
policies agreed under the Louvre pact with reference to
currency stability and monetary policy.
    Earlier on Monday the Bundesbnak injected liquidity into
the West German money market in a move which money market
dealers interpreted as an attempt by the West German monetary
authority to curb interest rate rises.
    The spokesman described Monday's talks, which he called
private, as very positive.

foreign ministry officials on monday on the tense situation in
the gulf, diplomatic sources said.
    They said the envoy's trip, to be followed from tuesday by
a visit to nicaragua, could be linked to a possible mediation
of the non-aligned movement in the seven-year-old iran-iraq war
but they ruled out any prominent cuban role in it.

<TITLE>US TROPICAL OIL LABELING PLAN SUFFERS DEFEAT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>A proposal to require imported
tropical oils to be labeled as saturated fats suffered a narrow
and possibly debilitating defeat in the U.S. Senate.
    The Senate Agriculture Committee rejected the proposal by a
10-8 vote, virtually snuffing out U.S. soybean producers' hopes
the plan would be adopted this year.
    A similar proposal has made no headway in the House.
    Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) offered the proposal as an
amendment to a farm spending reduction package.
    "I don't see this as a trade issue. I see it as giving
American consumers the information they need," he said.
    Proponents of the measure, including the American Soybean
Association, have claimed palm, palm kernel and coconut oils
are high in saturated fat and can contribute to heart disease.
    The U.S. soybean industry believes labels indicating
tropical oils are high in saturated fats would discourage
consumption of the oils, imported primarily from Malaysia,
Indonesia and the Philippines.
    But Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) read a letter from U.S.
Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, who said the proposal
"blatantly discriminates" against imports, would be impossible to
defend under international trade law and would harm relations
with the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia.
    Yeutter's letter also said Americans derive most of their
saturated fats from meat and dairy products and relatively
little from tropical oils.
    The committee voted largely along party lines, with three
Democrats joining seven Republicans to oppose the measure.

<TITLE>DELORS CALLS FOR G-7 MEETING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>European Community Commission
President Jacques Delors called for a swift convening of a
meeting of the G-7 countries following the instability in
today's trading on world money and stock markets.
    He told a press conference here: "G-7 should meet discreetly
and quickly."
    Delors said if the dollar were to fall further against the
mark to levels around 1.60, the European Monetary System would
undergo a "test by fire."
    Delors said the current problems in the markets had been
caused by excessive growth in financial trading, excessive
deregulation and the failure of the fundamentals of the world
economy to adapt themselves quickly enough to changing
circumstances.
    He said it was "profoundly unjust" to blame it on recent
increases in West Germany.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker
met West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and
Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl today in West Germany and
agreed to support the Louvre pact, the Treasury Department
said.
    The Treasury described the meeting as "a very positive,
private meeting in Frankfurt, West Germany which had been
agreed upon last week. "The parties agreed to continue economic
cooperation under the Louvre agreement and its flexible
application including cooperation on exchange rate stability
and monetary policies," the Treasury said.
    The Treasury said Baker and Stoltenberg "are consulting with
their G-7 colleagues and are confident that this will enable
them to foster exchange rate stability around current levels."
    The Louvre pact is an agreement between the Group of Seven
leading industrial countries including the United States and
West Germany to promote currency stability.
    Baker was scheduled to visit Scandinavia and Belgium this
week and the department earlier refused to release details of
his travel itinerary, citing security considerations.

<TITLE>U.S. MILITARY LEADER PREDICTS IRANIAN RESPONSE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>William Crowe, chairman of the U.S.
Joint Chiefs of Staff, predicted Iran will retaliate for the
U.S. strike against its oil platform though he said Iranian
options were limited.
    "They will be determined. They will not be easily deterred,
and let me stress for you that our commitment there is not
going to be risk free or casualty free."
    He said the most likely Iranian response would involve
terrorism or the laying of mines.
    "They obviously will look for ways that are probably more in
line with the 'silent hand' than what they have tried thus far,"
Crowe told an American Stock Exchange conference.
    He declined comment on a reporter's query whether he
favored a stronger move against Iran than that ordered by the
president.
    "We carried out the operation that was decided upon and we
carried it out with enthusiasm and I think it was
professionally and well done," Crowe said.

<TITLE>U.S. FORCES DESTROYED OIL RIG, RAIDED ANOTHER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. warships destroyed an Iranian oil
platform in the Gulf on Monday and the Navy also raided a
second oil rig in retaliation for Friday's Iranian missile
attack on a U.S. flag tanker, the Pentagon said.
    President Reagan and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger
warned Iran of even stronger countermeasures if the military
escalation between the two countries continued in the volatile
waterway.
    Reagan said he ordered the strike on the first platform by
four U.S. destroyers, which fired about 1,000 five-inch shells
at the Rostam oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain in the central
Gulf.
    A short time later, Navy personnel boarded a second Iranian
oil platform about five miles to the north and destroyed radar
and communications equipment before leaving the structure, the
Pentagon said.
     Defense Department spokesman Fred Hoffman told reporters
that the second platform had been abandoned by Iranian
personnel during the shelling and destruction of the first rig.
    The United States said both platforms were being used to
keep track of Gulf merchant shipping and to launch speedboat
attacks on such shipping by Iranian Revolutionary guards.

<TITLE>EC, U.S. PLAN HIGH-LEVEL TRADE TALKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community is willing to
offer limited concessions to the United States on one of two
major issues which threaten to poison their trade relations
next year, an EC commission spokesman said.
    He said the offer would be made at a meeting later this
month between U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter and EC
External Relations Commissioner Willy de Clercq.
    EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen told agriculture
ministers meeting in Luxembourg that the EC is willing to make
some temporary arrangements to lighten the impact on U.S.
Exports of an EC plan to ban the sales of meat from animals fed
with growth hormones, the spokesman said.
    Washington has said it will take trade reprisals if the EC
proceeds with the ban from January 1 and if European countries
do not quickly cut back what it sees as unfair subsidies to the
makers of their Airbus airliner which are harming U.S.
Manufacturers.
    It claims the hormones ban has no scientific basis and will
rob it of 130 mln dlrs' worth of exports a year.
    Diplomatic sources said the Yeutter-de Clercq meeting will
take place in London and will also involve the aerospace
ministers of France, Britain, West Germany and Spain, the
countries involved in the Airbus project.

<TITLE>BRITAIN BACKS U.S. STRIKE ON IRAN OIL PLATFORM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey
Howe backed the United States' attack on an Iranian oil
platform on Monday and said it should not worsen the Gulf
crisis.
    "The United States is fully entitled to take military action
in exercise of rights of self-defense, in the face of the
imminent threat of further attacks," Howe said in a statement
issued in London.
    The United States said its forces destroyed the platform on
Monday in retaliation for an Iranian missile attack on a U.S.-
flagged Kuwaiti ship last Friday.
    Referring to that attack, Howe added, "I trust the Iranians
will fully understand that continued attacks of this kind will
only enhance justification for firm action in self-defense."
    At a press conferenced in Luxembourg during a meeting of
European Community (EC) ministers, Howe was asked about
statements from a senior Iranian official who said America was
now involved in a full-scale war.
    "It would be profoundly undesirable and quite unjustified
for Iran to react in that way," he said.

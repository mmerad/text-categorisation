<TITLE>NORANDA SETS TEMPORARY MINE SHUTDOWN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Murdochville, Quebec, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Noranda Inc> said
production will remain shut down at its fire-damaged copper
mine here until it can completely examine the mine.
    The fire, which started Wednesday and burned itself out
late yesterday, killed one miner and trapped 56 others
underground for about 24 hours. The 56 were eventually brought
safely out of the mine.
    Company spokesman Dale Coffin said the investigation could
take from a few days to several weeks, but would not be more
specific.
    Noranda said that, when it resumes production, it plans to
operate the mine at about one-third of the normal 72,000 metric
tons annual finished capacity.
    The fire weakened part of the mine's support structure,
Coffin said.
    Noranda said if it decides to keep the mine open, it would
take four or five months before it could resume full
production.

<TITLE>FHLBB SAYS MORTGAGE RATES CONTINUE DECLINE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said
home mortgage rates fell from early February to early March to
their lowest point in nine years, but the rate of decline was
slower than it had been in recent months.
    The bank board said the average effective commitment rate
for fixed-rate mortgages for single family homes and a 25 pct
loan-to-price ratio with a maturity of at least 15 years was
9.48 pct in early March.
    The rate was four basis points lower than a month ago, only
one-eighth the size of decline in the previous month, the bank
board said.
    Rates for adjustable-rate mortgages decline eight basis
points from early February to 8.43 pct in early March, the bank
board said. The drop was far less than the 15 basis point
decline in the previous period, the agency said.
    The average effective interest rate on all loans closed by
major mortgage lenders declined nine basis points from early
February to early March, the agency said. The fall brought the
rate to 9.14 pct was the lowest since December 1977, it said.
    The effective rate for ARMS was 8.39 pct, 15 basis points
below a month earlier. For fixed-rate loans it was 9.36 pct, 14
basis points below a month earlier, the agency said.

<TITLE>UNION TO PROTEST DART'S SUPERMARKETS &lt;SGL> BID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LANDOVER, MD., April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United Food And Commercial
Workers said that more than 1,000 rank-and-file members of the
union will demonstrate Monday at Dart Group Corp's headquarters
protesting Dart's proposed 1.73 billion dlr takover of
Supermarkets General &lt;SGL>.
    Supermarkets is best known for its Pathmark chain of
supermarket drug stores in the New York and New Jersey area and
also owns Rickels home centers.
    The union said that it is firmly against the Dart bid
because "workers have always ended up with a raw deal in the
current takeover mania."
    A Union statement said: "We do not intend to allow our
members to pick up the tab for Supermarket General's executives
and the bankers or the Dart Group who stand to make millions."
    Dart is controlled by the Haft family of Washington, which
last year made a bid for California-based Safeway Stores Inc.
The Hafts lost, but walked away with at least 100 mln dlrs in
profits, analysts estimate.
    The union said that Dart's Safeway bid forced a major
restructuring at Safeway to pay the Hafts and their lawyers and
caused a loss of thousands of jobs.

<DATELINE>    TEMPE, Ariz., April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>FCS Laboratories Inc said merger
discussions with an unnamed privately-held company in the
health care field have ended without an agreement.
    The previously announced negotiations began last August,
the company said.
    "It's disappointing to spend so much time on these
negotiations and have them fail," said FCS chairman Nicholas
Gallo III. "But the discussions could not produce a deal
acceptable to our board in the context of the company's
stronger financial position today as compared to six months
ago."
    Gallo said FCS will stop actively seeking potential merger
partners, but will respond to serious inquiries.
    "We are determined to follow our plan to restore this
company to profitability," he said. "To continue actively
searching for potential acquirers inherently forces us to
postpone the implementation of critical decisions which are
part of the plan."
    The company, which has 4,475,930 common shares outstanding,
reaffirmed it expects to be profitable in the second half of
the fiscal year ending September 30, 1987.

<TITLE>BURLINGTON &lt;BNI> UNIT SETTLES BONDHOLDER SUIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SEATTLE, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Burlington Northern Inc said its
Burlington Northern Railroad Co unit reached an agreement in
principle to settle a class action lawsuit filed against the
company in May 1985 by holders of two series of the company's
bonds.
    It said the settlement arrangement calls for the company to
establish a cash settlement fund of 35.5 mln dlrs, which would
be distributed to the bondholders after deductions for
attorney's fees.
    The lawsuit, filed by holders of its four pct Prior Lien
bonds due January 1, 1997 and its three pct General Lien Bonds
due January 1, 2047, sought to prevent the release of
collateral, the company said.
    If the settlement agreement is approved, the trading prices
of the bonds will decline substantially because they will no
longer reflect the speculative premiums at which the bonds
currently trade, Burlington Northern also said.
    It said the settlement is subject to negotiation by
Burlington Northern, the Citibank N.A. unit of Citicorp &lt;CCI>
and Bankers Trust Co &lt;BT>, the bonds' trustees.

<TITLE>U.S., JAPANESE OPEN TALKS ON SEMICONDUCTORS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. and Japanese officials meet
tomorrow to try to settle a dispute over semiconductor trade
and to cut short the 300 mln dlr penalty tariffs President
Reagan has ordered imposed on Japanese exports.
    But U.S. officials held out little hope that any accord
could be reached before the tariffs of 100 per cent - up from
about five per cent - are to take effect on April 17.
    The Customs Bureau last week started to levy a bond on the
Japanese goods that Reagan ordered penalized. The penalties
would be retroactive to March 31.
    Reagan said on March 27 when ordering the tariffs that he
hoped the Japanese would soon end their unfair practices in
semiconductor trade and that sanctions could be lifted.
    Technical meetings are to be held today and tomorrow, with
meetings at a more senior level scheduled for Thursday and
Friday. Public hearings on the sanctions are set for April 13.
    The Japanese aides here for the technical talks include
Shigeru Muraoka, director-general of international trade policy
of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), and
Masashi Yamamoto, deputy director-general of the information
and machinery bureau.
    Meeting with them will Glen Fukushima, director of the
Japan office of the U.S. Trade Representative's Office, and Jim
Gradoville, of trade representative's office of industry and
services.
    The two sides in the Thursday and Friday talks will be
headed by Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith and
MITI vice minister Makoto Kuroda.

<TITLE>UK MINISTER LOOKS TO EASE TENSION WITH JAPAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.K. government hopes for a
breakthrough on the deadlock with Japan over trade policies
during next week's visit to Tokyo by Corporate Affairs Minister
Michael Howard, political sources said.
    Howard, who leaves for Japan tomorrow, told Reuters he will
try to promote understanding on trade issues during his visit.
    Meanwhile, Britain will re-examine a letter from Japanese
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone promising personal help in
solving the row over a U.K. firm's bid to win a significant
role in Japan's telecommunications market, government sources
said.
    Tensions have risen following Britain's decision to arm
itself early with new statutory powers which it says could be
used against certain Japanese financial institutions.
    Britain reacted optimistically at first to the letter from
Nakasone to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, seeing it as a
signal that he would work towards ensuring a satisfactory
outcome to the bid launched by Cable and Wireless Plc,
government officials said.
    But this view has since been clouded by reports from Tokyo
that Nakasone's assurances really constituted little more than
politeness in the face of British anger, they added.

<TITLE>CONABLE WARNS PROTECTIONISM MIGHT SPREAD</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alver Carlson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>World Bank President Barber Conable
expressed concern that trade protectionism, at the heart of a
new showdown between the United States and Japan, might spread
throughout the industrial world.
    But in an interview with Reuters, Conable said the action
by the United States to slap tariffs on certain electronic
goods from Japan did not mean the countries were heading for a
full-scale trade war.
    Conable said the World Bank has been pressing developing
countries to open their markets, arguing that a free trading
environment increased the possibility of global economic
growth.
    "We have, in fact, been making adjustment loans to many
countries in the developing world which have encouraged the
opening of their markets and we want to be sure that the
developed world doesn't close at the same time," he said.
    He said the U.S. action against Japan was "a significant
retaliatory step but it did not constitute a basic change in
trade policy."
    The interview came just before next week's semi-annual
meetings of the Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
    Referring to Brazil's recent interest payments moratorium,
Conable also said the global debt situation was very serious
and must be closely watched.
    He said the Bank, which in the past has concentrated on
making loans that assist the basic underpinnings in the
developing world such as dams, roads and sewers, will
increasingly make assistance available for economic reform.
    The Bank has increased these loans, in part because of the
debt crisis that has found countries desperately in need of new
funds for balance of payments adjustment and economic reforms
aimed at opening their markets, encouraging foreign investment
and reducing government's role in the economy.
    "We're comfortable with adjustment lending, we expect,
however, that it will never reach a majority of our portfolio,"
Conable said.
    He made clear, however, that adjustment lending would
continue to increase as a proportion of overall Bank lending
for some time.
    He noted, "the problem of debt was a severe one and many
countries are asking for adjustment assistance because of the
problem of debt."
    Conable, is a a former Republican Congressman from New York
chosen by President Reagan for the Bank position last year. He
is an associate of Treasury Secertary James Baker who launched
the U.S. strategy for shoring up indebted nations in October,
1985 which included a call for increased adjustment lending by
the World Bank.
    Conable also said that he expected the result of a major
study of the Bank's organization to be completed in the next
several weeks.
    He said the decision to seek a reorganization was based, in
part, on the fact that the Bank had come under fire from the
poorest countries for not doing enough to help and from the
richest countries because of inefficiency.
    the reorganization is considered a major initiative by
Conable, and is being closely-watched by the agency's 151
member-countries as an indication of his management style and
priorities.
    "I want to be sure this institution is viewed by those who
must support it as soundly constituted so that it will be
permitted to grow," Conable said.
    However, he said "I don't believe there is anything
basically wrong with this institution and I don't believe it
has to have any redefinition of its purpose."
    He said, however, that it was apparent that the debt
initiative proposed by Baker has given the Bank a central role
in dealing with the debt crisis.
    Conable added that cooperation between the Bank and its
sister agency, the International Monetary Fund, was good and
that he talked often with IMF Managing Director Michel
Camdessus on a variety of issues.
    On a personal level, Conable said that he not feel a need
to put his personal stamp on the Bank noting that "I don't have
a particular mission here except to be useful to the
institution and to the process of development."
    He added, "so I don't feel a great calling to personalize
the institution."
    On the development needs of sub-Sahara Africa, Conable said
that the Bank was constantly reviewing new ways for assisting
the region, noting that half of the recently agreed financing
of 12.4 billion dlrs for Bank's International Development
Association was earmarked for Africa.
    Leading industrial nations are expected to consider new
forms of debt relief for the very poorest nations, like those
in the Sub-Sahara, during next week's meetings.

attracted over 15 billion dlrs in syndication but will not be
increased, Morgan Guaranty Ltd said on behalf of Morgan
Guaranty Trust Co of New York, the arranger.
    It said that 64 of BP's relationship banks will be joining
the facility, although their participations will be cut back
dramatically. Banks had been invited as lead managers at 200
mln dlrs, managers at 125 mln and co-managers at 75 mln.
    BP will make the final decision on the allotments broadly
based on relationships rather than on the amounts offered.
    The facility is being arranged for BP International and BP
North America in conjunction with the company's planned tender
offer for the 45 pct of Standard Oil Co it does not already
own.
    Because of the purpose of the facility, Morgan only had
five business days to arrange the facility. As a result, it
carried terms that bankers considered relatively favourable
when compared with those on most other recent credits. The
facility fee, for example, was 1/8 pct compared with the 1/16
pct BP paid on a recent 1.5 billion dlr refinancing.

<TITLE>U.S. JOBS DATA SAID TO RULE OUT FED TIGHTENING</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Kathleen Hays, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>A steep drop in goods-producing jobs
detracted from U.S. March non-farm payroll employment and makes
it unlikely that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary
policy to defend the dollar, economists said.
    U.S. March non-farm payroll employment rose 164,000, less
than the gain of 220,000 to 290,000 the financial markets
expected. Manufacturing employment fell 25,000, compared with
February's 50,000 gain, while March construction employment
dropped 45,000 after being unchanged in February.
    "The momentum of industrial activity is tapering off as we
end the first quarter," said Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley
and Co Inc. "This sets the stage for more sluggish growth in
the second and third quarters."
    "The Fed will view this as a caution flag on the economy,"
he said. "They will not ease as long the dollar is weak, but
clearly they can't tighten."
    David Wyss of Data Resources Inc said that the downward
revision in February non-farm payroll employment to 236,000
from 337,000 means that employment gains in the first quarter
were weaker than expected.
    While Wyss left his first-quarter forecast of real U.S.
gross national product growth at 3.5 pct, he said the March
jobs data suggested a downward revision in his second-quarter
growth forecast to 2.5 pct from 2.8 pct.
    Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said the average
monthly gain in non-farm jobs in the first quarter was only
237,000, compared with 254,000 in the fourth quarter of 1986.
    "There's momentum in first quarter labor force activity, 
but less than assumed," he said. "Gains in goods-producing jobs
were subdued at best. This rules out any possibilty of the Fed
tightening for exchange-related purposes."
    In March, the average workweek fell back to its January
level of 34.8 hours from 35.0 hours in February. Manufacturing
hours also fell back to their January level, totalling 40.9
hours in March compared with 41.2 hours in February.
    The Commerce Department noted that loss of manufacturing
jobs in March was concentrated in automobile, electrical and 
electronic manufacturing.
    Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International said that a
13,000 decline in auto manufacturing employment accounted for
nearly half of the total drop in manufacturing jobs.
    Economists said that a build-up in auto inventories
resulting from a steep drop in sales has finally caught up with
the labor force and may point to slower growth ahead.
    Most expect an increase in inventories of as much as five
pct to offset a steep four to five pct drop in final sales in
the first-quarter GNP accounts.
    Roach said he expects first quarter U.S. GNP to rise two
pct, to be followed by a gain of 1.0-1.5 pct at best in the
second and third quarters. He said the March drop in industrial
activity "is a reasonable response in light of the inordinate
contribution inventory accumulation made to GNP."
    Economists said the employment data also suggest weak gains
in industrial production and personal income for March.
They expect only marginal gains, if not small declines, for
these indicators, compared with a February increases of 0.5 pct
in industrial production and 0.9 pct in personal income.
    Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities said the drop
in March construction employment may also signal a drop in
March housing starts, which rose 2.6 pct in February to 1.851
million units at an annual rate from 1.804 million units in
January.
    The rate of unemployment fell to 6.6 pct, its lowest level
since March 1980, from 6.7 pct in February. But Wyss pointed
out that this resulted from a drop in the labor force, which 
fell to 119.2 mln in March from 119.35 mln in February.
    "This just means that there were fewer people looking for
work, so the drop in unemployment doesn't mean much," he said.
    He said the latest employment report will not concern the
Fed because it does points to GNP growth in the first half of
2.5-3.0 pct, but "it does suggest they can't afford to tighten
to quickly either."
    The statistical factors used to smooth out seasonal
fluctuations in the jobs data may have understated March labor
force gains, just as seasonal factors probably overstated them
in January and February, Slifer said, but are consistent with
his forecast of 1.8 pct first quarter GNP growth.
    Economic growth remains sluggish, but Silfer does not think
that the Federal Open Market Committee changed policy at their
meeting this week. "At some point they will be more inclined to
ease," he said. For the time being, however, the March
employment report "increases the likelihood they won't tighten,
regardless of the dollar."

<TITLE>SEC CLARIFIES POSITION ON TENDER OFFER CHANGES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Securities and Exchange
Commission reminded corporate raiders and others tendering for
the shares of companies that they must extend the period their
offers are open if key conditions are changed.
    Specifically, the agency said those making tender offers
for companies' stock must extend the offers if they decide to
eliminate conditions requiring a minimum number of shares to be
tendered in order for the offers to be valid.
    Tender offers typically include minimum share conditions.
As a result, a purchaser would not be bound to buy the shares
that were tendered if the minimum level were not reached.
    In an interpretation of current rules, which officials said
clarifies the SEC's present position, the agency said a tender
offer must be extended if a minimum share condition is waived,
even if the purchaser reserved the right to do so.
    The interpretation makes clear that waiving a minimum share
condition is a "material change" of the tender offer under U.S.
securities law, SEC officials said.
    The SEC has already said that other specific material
changes, such as changes in the percentage of securities being
sought or the price being offered, made during the course of a
tender offer require a 10-day extension of the offer.
    The length of the extension, which is aimed at giving
shareholders an adequate chance to assess revisions of a tender
offer, was not specified in cases where the minimum share
conditions were waived.
    SEC officials said the length of the extension in such
cases would depend on the facts and circumstances surrounding
each case, but would generally be between five and 10 days.
    The agency cited two recent tender offers in which waivers
of a minimum share conditios were tried on the last day of each
offer, denying shareholders the chance to react to the new
information. Officials declined to identify the two offers.
    "If a bidder makes a material change near or at the end of
its offer, it will have to extend the offer to permit adequate
dissemination," the SEC said.
    Federal securities law requires that all tender offers
remain open for at least 20 business days.

<TITLE>U.S. SCIENTISTS SAY TROPICAL OILS HEALTH RISK</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By David Brough, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. scientists said some tropical
vegetable oils can be hazardous to consumers whose health is at
risk because of high levels of saturated fat, lending weight to
a campaign by the American Soybean Association (ASA) for
labelling changes.
    The scientists appeared to support an ASA charge, denied by
Malaysian palm growers, that imported coconut, palm and palm
kernel oils contain high levels of saturated fat and thus raise
blood cholesterol and the risk of heart disease.
    In a petition filed in January, the ASA asked the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) to require palm, palm kernel and
coconut oils to be identified as saturated fats on food
manufacturers' labels.
    The FDA responded to the ASA in a letter saying it would
consider the petition as a comment to a proposed rule dealing
with cholesterol and fatty acid labelling of foods.
    Malaysian oil palm growers have said the charges by the ASA
that palm oil consumption increases blood cholesterol and
contributes to heart disease are untrue.
    But Steve Chang, Professor of Food Science at Rutgers
University, said, "Palm oil is definitely not good for human
health because it has a high content of saturated fatty acid."
    He added that the higher the fatty acid, the greater the
blood cholesterol level. "It has been well established that
high cholesterol levels will have a higher level of heart
disease," he said.
    A Malaysian Oil Palm Growers Council official, Borge
Bek-Nielsen, has said studies have shown that palm oil is
cholesterol-free, low in saturated fats, has anti-cancer
properties and prevents blood clotting and blocking of arteries
in humans.
    Bek-Nielsen said Americans consume more saturated fats
daily through food like butter, bacon, ham and beef than from
palm oil, which, he added is rich in vitamins A and E.
    David Kritchevsky, Associate Director of the Wistar
Institute in Philadelphia, appeared to take the ASA view on
labelling. "What people really have to learn is to read labels,"
said Kritchevsky. "The more a consumer knows, the more likely he
will make an intelligent choice."
    The U.S. scientists said they had no doubt imported palm,
palm kernel and coconut oils contain high saturated fat levels.
    Kritchevsky, a specialist in nutrition, said, "More
saturated fat would raise cholesterol levels...So, from that
point of view it's a health risk. High cholesterol levels in
the blood are a risk factor for heart disease."
    Susanne Harris, deputy assistant secretary of the U.S.
Agriculture Department's Food and Consumer Services Division,
said the health risk among consumers of vegetable oils with
high saturated fat levels was highest among those who have
heart disease.
    The scientists said more than 50 pct of the fatty acid
content of the tropical oils was saturated, whereas less than
20 pct of the fatty acid content of soybean oil was saturated.
    David Ericksen, director of ASA's technical services, said
U.S. soybean producers could regain about one-half of the 273
mln dlrs in sales lost to imported tropical oils if consumers
were aware the vegetable oils were high in saturated fat.
    Imported tropical oils displace 171 mln bushels of U.S.
soybean sales in the U.S. market, ASA estimates.
    U.S. imports of coconut oil during January totaled 82.9 mln
lbs compared with 48.0 mln lbs in December and 106.5 mln a year
earlier, according to Commerce Department figures.
    Imports of palm oil totaled 44.0 mln lbs compared with 51.3
mln lbs in December and 85.2 mln a year earlier.

<TITLE>SNYDER &lt;SOI> MAKES CENERGY &lt;CRG> EXCHANGE OFFER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Snyder Oil Partners L.P. told the
Securities and Exchange Commission it made an exchange offer to
Cenergy Corp that would allow Snyder to acquire up to 49.9 pct
of the company's common stock.
    Under the exchange offer, which was proposed yesterday to
Cenergy's officers and directors, each share of Cenergy common
stock could be exchanged for 8.50 dlrs in market value of
Snyder's limited partnership units, Snyder said.
    Under the proposal, Snyder, which already holds 1,170,400
Cenergy common shares, or 12.0 pct of the total, could boost
its Cenergy stake to a total of 49.9 pct, it said.
    Snyder did not say whether it has received any response to
its proposal from Cenergy.
    If it acquires the 49.9 pct stake, Snyder said in its SEC
filing it would use the stock to "obtain a proportionate
beneficial interest" in the company's assets and liabilities.
    It said it has not decided its next move it the exchange
proposal does not lead to negotiations with Cenergy.
    Snyder said it may boost its stake or sell some or all of
its current holdings. It repeated a statement made in its
initial SEC filing last month that it is considering several
alternatives, including seeking control of Cenergy.

<TITLE>CANADA OIL INDUSTRY SET FOR RECOVERY - ANALYSTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By LARRY WELSH, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Firmer crude oil prices, government aid
packages and corporate spending cuts will help Canada's oil
industry recover from last year sharp downturn, industry
analysts said.
    They said there will be significant earnings gains in 1987
compared to last year's dismal results when oil prices dropped
about 50 pct.
    On Canada's stock exchanges, energy shares have soared to
their highest levels since 1983, with many issues trading at
record highs.
    "This is reflecting a tremendous amount of optimism on the
part of the investment community that the outlook for the
industry for the future is extremely attractive," Peters and Co
Ltd oil analyst Wilf Gobert said.
    Financial statements from Canada's major oil companies,
culminating with Dome Petroleum Ltd's 2.20 billion Canadian dlr
1986 loss reported this week, painted a bleak picture of last
year's results, analysts said.
    "But the financial statements are a snap shot and a
recording of history. The stock market is the indication of the
future," Gobert commented.
    The Toronto Stock Exchange's oil and gas index of 41
companies is up to 4065.4 so far in trading today from 3053.15
at the end of 1986.
    Among Canada's largest oil companies, class A shares of
Imperial Oil Ltd &lt;IMO.A>, 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, is
trading at 71, up from a 52-week low of 34-3/4.
    Shell Canada Ltd, 72 pct owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group,
is at 40-1/2, up from a low during the last year of 18-3/4.
Texaco Canada Inc &lt;TXC>, 78 pct owned by Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, is
at 34-7/8, up from a low of 24-1/2.
    Levesque Beaubien Inc oil analyst Robert Plexman forecasts
operating profit for 10 of Canada's largest oil and gas
companies will rise 37 pct in 1987 to about 1.44 billion dlrs
and operating cash flow will increase 12 pct to 3.24 billion
dlrs, based on an average oil price for the year of 16.50 U.S.
dlrs a barrel. "However, if prices hold about 18 U.S. dlrs a
barrel...1987 net operating income could show a 69 pct increase
with cash flow 27 pct higher," analyst Plexman said.
    "Although it is difficult to forecast the extent of the
profit improvement this year, the gain should be significant,"
he added.
    Those improvements follow a sharp downturn in 1986, when
operating income for the ten companies dropped 47 pct to 1.05
billion dlrs and operating cash flow fell 22 pct to 2.90
billion dlrs.
    But one industry source doesn't think oil prices will hold
recent gains and more government assistance is needed.
    Canadian Petroleum Association technical director Hans
Maciej sees industry cash flow falling another 10 pct in 1987,
after dipping about 60 pct last year. Maciej said he sees crude
oil supply outweighing demand and doesn't believe a recent OPEC
production accord will continue to support prices.
    However, several companies share the optimistic industry
outlook expressed by a majority of analysts.
    Shell Canada and &lt;Norcen Energy Resources Ltd> forecast
improved 1987 earnings in their annual reports issued this
week, assuming oil prices remain at or above 1986 levels.
    "The industry's outlook for 1987 is positive, but not
robust," Texaco Canada said in its annual report.
    "While oil prices have strengthened somewhat and there is
good reason to believe that the general level is sustainable,
continued volatility is likely," Texaco Canada added.
    In the face of short-term uncertainty, many companies have
pared 1987 spending plans from last year's lower levels,
deferring most frontier exploration work.
    "The industry is becoming very selective in investments,
very conservative and cautious, which is not unexpected,"
Canadian Petroleum Association's Maciej said.
    Federal and Alberta goverment aid measures helped cushion
the industry downturn in 1986 and are improving 1987 results.
    The most significant help came last September when the
federal government lifted the 10 pct Petroleum Gas Revenue Tax
(PGRT) 28 months earlier then planned.
    Analysts estimate the tax relief will save larger oil
companies about 1.50 billion dlrs by the end of 1988.
    The PGRT cut helped brake the steep profit and cash flow
decline in 1986 for many oil companies and prevented further
exploration spending cuts, analysts said.
    "For a number of companies, the PGRT cut was absolutely
necessary to even maintain the kind of reduced investments that
were made, otherwise the reduction would have been considerably
more," Maciej said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>LOWER U.S. RICE STOCKS, STRONG EXPORTS - USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Rising demand for U.S. rice may
gradually reduce surpluses while a marketing loan should help
increase the U.S. share of the world rice market despite
sluggish trade this year, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    In its quarterly rice outlook and situation summary, the
department said U.S. rice use may surpass production during the
1986/87 marketing year, causing stocks to fall about 10 mln
hundredweight from a year earlier to an estimated 67 mln cwt on
July 31.
    Long grain acreage as a percentage of total acreage is
expected to decline this year, the report said.
    USDA said factors once supportive of increased long grain
acreage have turned around. Domestic prices of medium grain
relative to long grain have increased, the loan differential
has been greatly reduced and increases in long grain yields
relative to those of other classes have leveled off.
    With the drop in domestic prices resulting from the
marketing loan, domestic rice use is expected to grow at a
faster rate, USDA said.
    "Development of new products and increased promotion have
helped make rice more available and visible to a wider range of
consumers," USDA said.
    USDA said world trade is expected to fall in 1987 because
of large production and stocks but a weaker market should
affect competing exporters more than the U.S.
    "The United States has already recovered a substantial share
of the European Community market and made inroads into markets
in the Middle East and Africa," the report said.
    World rice consumption is projected to reach record levels
in 1986/87, the report said, as higher per capita incomes,
increased domestic production and low import prices have
allowed people in many countries to substitute rice for coarse
grains.
    China, India and South Korea have increased output, while
the Middle East and Africa have doubled imports since the
mid-1970s, the report said.

<TITLE>HUTTON &lt;EFH> STILL INTERESTED IN PUROLATOR &lt;PCC></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>E.F. Hutton LBO Inc is still interested
in an acquisition of Purolator Courier Corp, and is examining
the possibility of raising its 35 dlr per share offer, an E.F.
Hutton spokesman said.
    Hutton's offer was topped by a 40 dlr per share offer from
Emery Air Freight Corp &lt;EAF> earlier this week.
    "We're definately not out of it at this point," the Hutton
spokesman said.
    "We want to see what the offer is completely and understand
it fully, and then fashion our response," the spokesman said.
    After Emery made its offer, Hutton extended the deadline on
its offer to Monday. The offer was to have expired Wednesday.
    Analysts said it might be difficult for Hutton to raise the
offer since Emery, an overnight courier, might have an easier
time justifying a lofty price since it would realize cost
savings by combining its business with those of Purolator.
    Purolator, a New Jersey-based overnight courier, has
declined comment.
    Purolator had traded above the Hutton offer price on
speculation a new bidder would emerge. It was up 1/8 today at
40-3/8, above the Emery offer.

<TITLE>INTERNATIONAL LPG PRICES MIXED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>International LPG prices were mixed in
the past week, with North Sea prices easier while prices in the
Mediterranean and the Gulf were up in April, traders said.
    In the North Sea market, small cargoes of propane were sold
as high as 126 dlrs per tonne on the f.o.b. basis early in the
week, but prices eased after the majors posted their April
contract prices, traders said.
    British Petroleum plc &lt;BP> left propane unchanged at 110
dlrs and raised butane prices 5.50 dlrs to 123 dlrs, Shell, a
unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD> &lt;ST> raised propane three
dlrs to 113 and butane 5.50 dlrs to 123 dlrs, they said.
    In the Mediterranean, prices firm in Lavera as Algerian
supplies were not always available. Spot propane was unchanged,
while butane rose about 25 dlrs from last week, traders said.
    They said, however, the Mediterranean butane market was
very thin, making it subject to wide price swings.
    In the Gulf, strong demand from the Far East pushed premium
on small cargoes five to 10 dlrs above government selling price
(gsp) for propane and 10 dlrs for butane, traders said. 
    The rising premium over gsp, however, was partially offset
by about 10 pct decline in shipping, making prices for propane
about unchanged and butane five dlrs higher, basis c. and f.
Japan, the traders said.

<DATELINE>    DENTON, Texas, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Scott Instruments Corp said its
independent public accountants qualified the report on Scott's
1986 financial statements because of its weak financial
condition.
    The report indicates the realization of the company's
assets is dependent on it obtaining enough working capital to
finance operations and additional funds to meet other
liabilities, among other things.
    These factors indicate the company may be unable to
continue its existence.
    Earlier, Scott reported a 1986 loss of 1.9 mln dlrs
compared to a loss of almost 2.2 mln dlrs in 1985. Total assets
were nearly 1.1 mln dlrs at year end, down from 1.2 mln dlrs
the prior year.

third quarter ended March 31 and said sales for the quarter
would be about 400,000 dlrs, about 50 pct below sales in the
same year-ago quarter.
    Network said it is taking the charge due to the significant
increase in accounts receivable which remain uncollected for
more than 90 days after billing. It said it ultimately will
collect most of those accounts.
    It attributed the sales decline to a transition period for
its new products and a delay in a major order.

the U.S. bankruptcy code.
    Shareholders approved an increase in authorized shares to

<TITLE>U.S. MEAT PROCESSORS ASK FOR LABELLING CHANGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Four U.S. meat processors have asked
the federal government to relax a labelling requirement which
they said discourages the use of mechanically separated meat,
the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    The petition, filed by Bob Evans Farms, Odom Sausage Co,
Sara Lee Corp and Owens Country Sausage, asks USDA to allow
mechanically separated meat to be listed on product labels as
the species from which it was derived.
    For example, "pork" would be listed on the ingredients
statement instead of "mechanically separated pork."
    Under the petition, the calcium content of the meat product
would have to be stated on the label and the mechanically
separated meat could constitute no more than 10 pct of the meat
and poultry portion of the product.
    Mechanically separated meat is a high-protein, low-cost
product that has been approved for use since 1978, USDA said.
    Current regulations allow use of mechanically separated
ingredients at levels up to 20 pct of the meat and poultry
product, but require it to be listed in the ingredient
statement as "mechanically separated (species)," USDA said.
    USDA said the petitioning firms claimed companies avoid
using mechanically separated meat in their products because the
term carries an "unwarranted negative connotation" in the minds
of many consumers. The petitioners also noted that no similar
regulation exists for poultry products.
    Mechanically separated meat is made by placing carcass
parts, which usually have been hand-trimmed but still have some
remaining meat, into specialized processing equipment.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>FEBRUARY FOMC VOTES UNCHANGED MONETARY POLICY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Open Market Committee at
its February 10-11 meeting voted nine to one to maintain the
then-existing degree of reserve restraint, minutes showed.
    The FOMC issued an asymmetric inter-meeting policy
directive which gave greater possibility to firmer rather than
easier policy. The Committee set a six to seven pct January
through March annualized growth target for M-2 and M-3 and no
M-1 goal. At the prior meeting in mid-December, the FOMC set a
seven pct target for M-2 and M-3 for November through March.
    The February FOMC kept the four to eight pct Federal funds
rate "reference" range for policy, as in other recent meetings.
    At a telephone conference on February 23, committee members
discussed the possible implications of the decisions reached in
Paris for U.S. intervention in foreign exchange markets. No
conclusions were contained in the minutes.
    In its inter-meeting policy directive, the February FOMC
said that "somewhat greater reserve restraint would, or
slightly lesser reserve restraint might, be acceptable
depending on the behavior of the aggregates, taking into
account the strength of the business expansion, developments in
foreign exchange markets, progress against inflation, and
conditions in domestic and international credit markets."
    The February FOMC voted nine to one for an unchanged
policy. Thomas Melzer, St Louis Federal Reserve Bank president
favored some tightening of reserve conditions.
    He noted the strong growth in bank loans in November
through January and the firm federal funds rate that had
prevailed despite the extraordinary pace of reserve growth. He
also cited the recent declines in the dollar's value.
    Finally, looking ahead, Melzer pointed out the potential
for a further rise in inflationary expectations. He believed
that prompt restraints might avert the need for more
substantial tightening later.
    Regarding inter-meeting policy adjustments, the FOMC
minutes showed, "the members generally felt that policy
implementation should be especially alert to the potential need
for some firming of reserve conditions."
    In this view, the FOMC said somewhat greater reserve
restraint would be warranted if monetary growth did not slow in
line with current expectations and there were concurrent
indications of intensifying inflationary pressures against the
background of stronger economic data.
    One indication of potential price pressure might be a
further tendency for the dollar to weaken.
    The minutes showed that one member, presumably Melzer,
preferred a directive that did not contemplate any easing
during the weeks ahead. However, "most of the members did not
want to rule out the possibility of some slight easing during
the inter-meeting period, although they did not view the
conditions for such a move as likely to emerge."
    The FOMC members assumed that future fluctuations in the
dollar's value would not be of sufficient magnitude to have any
significant effect on the Fed's economic projections. In
addition, they anticipated that considerable progress would be
made in reducing the federal budget deficit.

<TITLE>U.S. CABLE TV CREDIT UNLIKELY TO IMPROVE, SAYS S/P</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poor's Corp said that the
credit quality of most U.S. cable television companies is
unlikely to improve in the near term.
    S and P said that after two years and many delays and
disappointments, the cable television industry has firmly
established a net cash generating position.
    However, rather than using their improved position to
decrease the leverage of current capital structures, the
companies' cash flows are being fully leveraged to finance a
wave of consolidations, S and P said.
    Many cable television companies exhibit greater financial
risk because of their asset growth aspirations and
debt-financed consolidation. That delays a lower risk profile
for many of them, Standard and Poor's said.
    The acquisition and financial growth policies of many
company executives heavily influenced the ratings outlook.
    Citing aggressive capital structures, acquisitions and cash
flow coverages of interest expense of between 1.0 and 1.5
times, S and P noted that the companies are more debt intensive
now than in their building phase. These factors keep their
ratings at speculative grades, the agency concluded.

market jitters amplified by rumors that a big holder of
domestic bonds was selling early in the day, dealers said.
    The market had opened 1/4 to 3/8 point stronger on news of
unexpectedly weak U.S. employment data for March, but the
advance sparked profit-taking which forced prices down about
1/4 point on the day. Rumors of a major seller were not
confirmed but some traders felt limited potential for further
Canadian dollar gains might be taking some of the shine off
domestic bonds. The benchmark Canada 9-1/2 pct of 2001 ended at
106-1/4 3/8 and the 8-1/2 pct of 2011 at 97-1/4 1/2.

<DATELINE>    BOGOTA, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>State-run oil company Ecopetrol said
Colombia's main oil pipeline was bombed again and pumping of
170,000 barrels per day was suspended.
    A spokeswoman for the company said that the early morning
dynamite attack was the 31st in the last nine months on the
Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline, which links Colombia's biggest
oilfied at Cravo Norte to the Caribbean.
    She said about 2,000 barrels of crude were spilled and
could not indicate when pumping would resume. The attack was
near Magangue in northeastern Bolivar province.
    Ecopetrol is exploiting Cravo Norte in association with
Occidental Petroleum Corp &lt;OXY> and Shell Petroleum N.V., a
unit of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD> &lt;ST>.
    Ecopetrol said in a communique that bombings since last
July led to a loss of more than 110,000 barrels of crude, or
the equivalent of 10 mln dlrs.

<TITLE>U.S. DEFENDS STOCKPILED TIN SALES IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States defended its sales
of stockpiled tin in 1986 in reaction to criticism from
Malaysian miners who have said it violated an agreement with
southeast Asian producers.
    "The United States has continued to abide by the spirit of
the memorandum of understanding and has consulted with the
ASEAN states on GSA tin disposals," a State Department spokesman
said in a statement.
    "The views of the ASEAN governments have been taken into
account in determining disposal levels," the statement said.
    The United States and the ASEAN countries signed a
memorandum of understanding concerning tin disposals by the
U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) in December 1983.
    In its latest annual report, the States of Malaya Chamber
of Mines said the GSA sold 5,490 tonnes of tin in 1986, well
above an agreed upon annual limit of 3,000 tonnes. "The United
States appears to have lost sight of the U.S./ASEAN Memorandum
of Understanding," it said.
    The State Department statement said GSA tin disposals
increased in calendar year 1986 due to changed market
conditions. During the first quarter of calendar year 1987,
they have been running at a lower rate compared to 1986.
    The spokesman declined to say how much stockpiled tin the
GSA sold last year, however.

<TITLE>TIME &lt;TL> SEES DILUTION FROM SCOTT, FORESMAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Time Inc said the acquisition of Scott,
Foresman and Co last year will dilute earnings per share by
about 17 cts a share for the full year in 1987.
    For the first quarter the acquisition will have a negative
impact of about 20 cts per share, chief financial officer
Thayer Bigelow told security analysts.
    He said Scott, Foresman, a textbook publisher, will
contribute more than 50 mln dlrs in operating income before
depreciation and amortization for the full year.
    N.J. Nicholas, president and chief operating officer, said
Soctt Foresman will have over 200 mln dlrs in revenue in 1987.
    Bigelow said the textbook business, which normally has its
highest profit in the third quarter and incurs a loss in the
first quarter, will have an "adverse impact of 15 mln dlrs' on
book publishing income for the first quarter.
    "First quarter performance for the rest of Time Inc will be
better than last year," Bigelow said.
    The dilution of 17 cts per share for 1987 includes the
effects of financing the acquisition. Bigelow also said the
company is "comfortable" with estimates that earnings will be
between 3.75 dlrs and 4.25 dlrs per share for the year.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>U.S. TREASURY MARKET ENDS SHARPLY HIGHER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Treasury market ended sharply
higher, reassured by news that the Federal Open Market
Committee voted in February to maintain the then-existing
degree of restraint on bank reserves, dealers said.
    News of a weaker-than-expected March employment report and
a minor bounce back in the dollar prompted short-covering that
pushed coupon issues higher, while an easing in the Federal
funds rate below six pct helped short-dated issues.
    The key 7-1/2 pct 30-year Treasury bond price finished 3/4
higher at 95-27/32, pushing the yield down to 7.86 pct from
7.93 pct yesterday.
    Danuta Zielonka of Wertheim Schroder Co Inc said that
recent slowing in the growth of the monetary aggregates is a
another factor arguing against firmer Fed policy.
    "Money growth has been slowing perceptibly in March which
should give them more room to not tighten," she said. "Both M2
and M3 are will be at the low end of their target ranges in
March."
    "The FOMC minutes are neutral for the bond market,"
Zielonka said. "Dollar considerations will prevent them from
easing anytime soon, but they can't tighten with the economy
weak and the banks having to deal with Brazil."
    Doubts on the economy's strength were underscored not only
by a smaller-than-expected 164,000 gain in March non-farm
payrolls, but also by a downward revision in February's gain to
236,000 from a previously reported 337,000.
    The market's initial reaction to the data was restrained by
fears the employment news would undermine the dollar, but when
the dollar maintained a firm tone, the bond market extended its
gains.
    Profit-taking pulled bond prices down from the day's highs,
but a record close in the U.S. stock market stimulated buying
late in the day that offset this somewhat.
    Still, coupon issues were unable to recover completely from
this week's steep losses as trade tensions between the U.S. and
Japan pressured the dollar and discouraged Japanese investors
from buying U.S. Treasury bonds.
    The current 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond traded down to 94-11/32
in Tokyo this week, pushing the yield to 7.98 pct. This capped
the U.S. 1987 high yield on the 30-year bond of 7.93 pct, seen
yesterday.
    Treasury bills advanced on the week. The six-month bills
rose one basis point, but three-month bills fell 17 basis
points and the year bill fell two basis points.
    Dealers said that the sharp drop in three-month bills
resulted in part from recent outright bill purchases for a
customer, believed to be related to heavy intervention by
foreign central banks to support the dollar.
    A drop in the Fed funds rate to 5-15/16 today underpinned a
decline in bill rates. It traded at this level throughout the
session, down from yesterday's 6.14 pct average.
    Three-month bills closed two basis points lower at 5.48 pct
bid. Six- and 12-month bills both dropped nine basis points to
respective bids of 5.70 pct and 5.75 pct.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Mario Gabelli, head of New York
investment firm Mario Gabelli and Co, said he sold some shares
of GenCorp Inc &lt;GY> as part of a "portfolio rebalancing"
process to meet the needs of his more than 600 clients.
    He said as the stock moved up following acquisition
proposals from a group formed by AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG> and
Wagner and Brown, some of his clients were overweighted.
    Regarding the company's shareholders meeting Tuesday,
Gabelli told Reuters, "there was nothing said that caused me to
sell or buy." He still thinks "values are 140 dlrs per share or
more" and has clients that asked to buy more.
    Gabelli said he amended certain filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission because his clients are now passive
investors. "We wanted to remove our clients from the process
unfolding between GenCorp and Wagner and Brown," he said.
    He said he was pleased that chairman A. William Reynolds
stated at the meeting that he found the concept of greenmail to
be "repugnant." Greenmail refers to a corporation buying out a
shareholder at a premium not available to others.

<TITLE>GULF STATES (GSU) SEES END TO CASH BY MAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BEAUMONT, Texas, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Gulf States Utilities Co said
its condition has "significantly deteriorated" and that its
operating cash reserves will be inadequate by May 1987 unless
it receives additional financing or rate relief from state
public utilities commissions in Texas and Louisiana.
    In the company's newly-released annual report and 10-K
filing, Gulf States said its bank lenders had notified the
utility last month that no additional credit would be granted.
Gulf States said the banks had requested the utility to begin
making prepayments by the end of April of 45 mln dlrs more than
the estimated 1987 lease payments of 40 mln dlrs.
    "The circumstances increase the likelihood that the company
may have to seek protection from its creditors under the
bankruptcy code," Gulf States said.
    The utility had previously said it might be forced to
consider filing for bankruptcy because of limited rate
increases granted by state regulators in connection with Gulf
States' 4.3 billion dlr River Bend nuclear plant in Louisiana.
    "If the regulatory commissions approve the company's
proposed rate moderation plan and grant the increases provided
for in such plan during the initial three-year phase-in period,
the company believes it could achieve financial stability,"
Gulf States said.
    In February, the Texas Public Utilities Commission granted
Gulf States an interim rate increase of 39.9 mln dlrs
contingent upon the utility obtaining a new 250 mln dlr line of
credit to pay operating expenses. The utility had sought 144.1
mln dlrs in rate hikes in Texas.
    Gulf States has appealed a decision by Louisiana state
regulators rejecting its application for 100 mln dlrs in
emergency rate relief.
    In 1986, Gulf States earned 244.9 mln dlrs on revenues of
1.47 billion dlrs, compared to profits of 265.4 mln dlrs on
sales of 1.85 billion in the previous year.

<TITLE>FINANCE UNITS GAIN FROM PARENT COMPANY, SAYS S/P</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poor's said that currently
17 finance units benefit from parent relationships by receiving
higher ratings than their financial performance alone would
merit.
    By drawing on its parent company's strength, a weaker
finance subsidiary can achieve a credit rating as high as its
parent.  An independent finance company on the other hand must
operate within more stringent guidelines than a unit and is at
a competitive disadvantage, S and P said. 
    The agency rates a finance unit on its creditworthiness  as
well as the support agreement it has with its parent.
    Standard and Poor's said that some finance subsidiaries
have formal support agreements with the parent company which
obligate the parent to maintain the unit's net worth.  The
agreement assures that the unit meets its obligations on time
and requires it to operate within specific guidelines.
    Others have less formal agreements with the parent like
General Electric Credit Corp &lt;GE> whose AAA rating reflects its
parent's, General Electric Co.  But GE injected sizeable equity
into the unit at timely intervals, S and P noted.
    These agreements are being tested as finance firms expand,
and S and P said it will review a unit that violates the pact.

industry has been falling since mid-1986 and will decline by
between one and two pct this year after a 2.5 pct increase in
1986, the Ifo economic institute said.
    An Ifo report said recessionary influences were affecting
the engineering industry particularly. It saw a decline of two
to three pct in this sector after a 5.2 pct rise in 1986.
    Orders, especially from abroad, were also falling sharply
for capital goods in the electronics sector, it added.
    Ifo also predicted stagnation in the automobile industry in
1987 after a particularly successful 1986 when production rose
5.1 pct.
    Chemical industry production, which fell by 0.9 pct last
year, was likely to stagnate or decline by one pct in 1987.
This sector suffered from slack demand from abroad and from low
domestic consumption.

100 mln dlr digital telephone exchange order in the United
States, which it said was the first major U.S. Telephone
exchange order not to go to established U.S. Suppliers.
    &lt;South Central Bell Telephone Co>, a unit of Bellsouth Corp
&lt;BLS.N>, placed the order with Plessey's U.S. Subsidiary
&lt;Stromberg-Carlson>.
    Most of the equipment for the 100 exchanges will be built
in Stromberg-Carlson's Florida plant over the next three years.
    "It is the most important thing that has happened in the
Plessey telecommunications business," said Plessey
Telecommunications Managing Director David Dey.
    The British firm failed to win a four billion dlr deal to
supply an advanced communications system to the U.S. Army in
November 1985 despite personal lobbying by Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher. A rival French system won the contract.

<TITLE>LAWSON SAYS U.K. ELECTION NOT ONLY EMS BAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KNOKKE-HEIST, Belgium, April 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>British Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the next U.K. Election was not the
only element standing in the way of full British membership of
the European Monetary System (EMS).
    But he added that arguments against joining had weakened.
    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, widely believed to be the
strongest government opponent of full EMS membership, has made
clear she does not expect to consider joining until after the
next UK election, due by mid-1988 at the latest.
    But Lawson, in answer to a question, told reporters after
an informal European Community finance ministers' meeting here
that other factors apart from the upcoming election stood in
the way of full membership.
    In addition to the question of the exchange rates at which
Britain should enter the EMS's core exchange rate mechanism,
there was also the impact of sterling membership on the system
to be considered, he said.
    British entry would change the EMS from a monopolar system
based on the West German mark to a bipolar mark-sterling
system, he noted. "We have to make sure it would work."
    But Lawson added that some of the considerations that had
made it difficult for Britain to join in the past now posed
less of a problem.
    As an example he cited sterling's role as a petrocurrency,
which he said was diminishing. "That argument has clearly
weakened," he said.
    Lawson restated that the government was keeping the
question of membership under review.

<TITLE>EC AGREES ON NEED TO STRENGTHEN EMS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Tony Carritt, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    KNOKKE-HEIST, Belgium, April 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>European Community (EC)
finance ministers and central bankers agreed on the need for
greater cooperation to strengthen the European Monetary System
(EMS) against international market turbulence, officials said.
    "There was a general will to reinforce the European Monetary
System, with all that implies," Belgian Finance Minister Mark
Eyskens said yesterday after hosting a one-day session of
informal talks at this Belgian coastal resort.
    The gathering was the first such discussion since the
second major realignment of EMS parities within nine months in
January.
    The system has come under severe strain as funds have
flowed out of the slumping dollar and into the dominant EMS
currency, the West German mark, sending it soaring against
weaker currencies in the system.
    But Eyskens said February's agreement between leading
western industrialised nations to stabilise exchange rates at
around current levels was working and this would allow the EC
to speed up its efforts to boost the internal stability of the
EMS.
    He told a news conference yesterday's meeting agreed on the
need for closer coordination among EMS member governments of
interest rate policies and of interest rate differentials
between different countries.
    They also agreed they needed better coordination of
exchange market intervention to hold currencies stable, both
when they reached their fixed EMS limits and within their
agreed margins.
    But Eyskens said this coordination raised a whole range of
technical problems and ministers would discuss these further in
Luxembourg in June on the basis of proposals from the EC's
Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors.
    He said the EC needed a set of indicators of economic
convergence betwen Community countries and it was important
that interest rates fulfilled this role together with exchange
rates and inflation rates.
    The Belgian minister, whose country presently holds the
presidency of the community, made clear the meeting had not
produced any agreement to move radically forward in developing
the EMS towards the EC's long term goal of economic and
monetary integration.
    "We have committed ourselves to reestablishing the normal
functioning of the system," Eyskens said.
    Eyskens has repeatedly stressed that he believes the EMS
has to be reinforced if the EC's plans to liberalise all
movements of capital across national borders by 1992 are to go
ahead.
    EC executive Commission President Jacques Delors told the
meeting the authority would put forward proposals for a final
phase of capital market liberalisation in October that would
include safeguard clauses for member countries for which the
move would create difficulties.
    Eyskens said the ministers and central bankers also
discussed the need to "dedramatise" realignments of EMS parities
by letting high-ranking monetary officials carry them out by
telephone rather than calling a meeting of finance ministers.
    However, West German sources said Bonn Finance Minister
Gerhard Stoltenberg was unenthusiastic about the idea.
    British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told
journalists that one of the technical issues raised by greater
coordination of exchange market intervention was the question
of which currencies should be used to intervene and held in
central bank reserves.
    He said several EMS member countries believed the EMS would
work better if central banks held each other's currencies -- an
issue of particular importance regarding West Germany since the
Bundesbank holds only dollars in its foreign exchange reserves.
    He said the debate on dedramatising EMS realignments
reflected a general feeling among participants that the way the
January reshuffle had been conducted was unsatisfactory.
   The realignment was marked by acrimony between France and
West Germany, with each side blaming the other for strains in
the system that forced the parity overhaul.

<TITLE>ZAMBIAN CURRENCY FALLS AT FOREIGN EXCHANGE AUCTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUSAKA, April 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Zambian currency further depreciated
yesterday at the second auction since the introduction of a
two-tier foreign exchange system last month.
    The (central) Bank of Zambia said the kwacha was pegged at
16.99 to the dollar, compared to last week"s rate of 15 to the
dollar.
    The bank, which offered six mln dlrs at the auction,
reported demand for 13.4 mln dlrs. At the previous auction, the
government offered eight mln dlrs.
    Last month the government set a fixed exchange rate of nine
kwacha per dollar, subject to adjustment against a basket of
five currencies, for certain official transactions.
    It also introduced a new weekly foreign exchange auction
only for parastatal organisations and the private sector, where
the exchange rate is allowed to float in accordance with market
demand.
    The new auction system is designed to be more restrictive
than the previous one, suspended in January after the central
bank fell 10 weeks in arrears to successful bidders.
    Under the new system, no bidder, except the the state oil
company Zimoil and the national airline Zambia Airways, is
allowed to bid for more than five pct of the foreign exchange
on offer.

eight warships in the area at all times rather than part of the
time, as happens now, the paper said.
    The paper said that last month U.S. Intelligence sources
said they had spotted land-based anti-ship missiles of a
Chinese design known in the West as the HY-2 near the Strait of
Hormuz.
    It said their purpose was seen as a signal Iran was ready
to continue and perhaps step up the Gulf shipping war against
Iraq.
    U.S. Carriers or battleships would sail out of range of
those missiles, but within striking distance, the paper quoted
officials as saying.
    From several hundred miles at sea, carriers could launch
aircraft bombing runs or missile strikes, and battleships could
fire long-range missiles, the paper said.

<TITLE>BOUYGUES &lt;BOUY.PA> TV AWARD SEEN BOOSTING GROUP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, April 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>A consortium headed by the construction
group Bouygues SA has been awarded a 50-pct controlling stake
in French state television network TF1, which stock market
analysts said represented a major boost for Bouygues.
    The Bouygues-led consortium was widely regarded as the less
likely of the two candidates in contention to be awarded the
three billion franc stake by the National Commission for
Communications and Liberties (NCCL), the French television
watchdog authority.
    The losing candidate was a consortium headed by publishing
group Hachette SA &lt;HACP.PA>.
    The NCCL decision awarded the Bouygues consortium a 50-pct
controlling stake in a company which will have a 10-year
operating concession for TF1, France's oldest and most widely
watched television network.
    Independent market analysis group C.O.P.S. In a note on
Bouygues said the award would represent a major diversification
for the group out of the highly cyclical construction industry
into the rapidly expanding media business.
    Bouygues in February said it estimated 1986 group net
attributable profit at 480 mln francs, up from 443 mln for
1985, on consolidated turnover of 45.8 billion francs, up from
26.3 billion.
    The sharp rise in turnover reflected the groups acquisition
of the loss-making SCREG construction group last year.
    Bouygues closed on the Paris stock market at 1,451 francs
on Friday, up from 1,405 the previous day, but well below its
year's high of 1,475.
    Hachette closed at 3,280, up from a previous 3,250.
    Bouygues holds a 50-pct stake in the winning consortium,
giving it a 25-pct stake in TF1.
    The U.K.-based &lt;Pergamon Media Trust> of Robert Maxwell has
a 20-pct stake in the consortium, representing a 10 pct stake
in TF1, while &lt;Maxwell Media France> has a six pct stake, or
three pct of the television network.
    Minority shareholders in the consortium include the
&lt;GMF/FNAC> group, Societe Generale &lt;SGEN.PA>, &lt;Editions
Mondiale>, the &lt;Groupe Bernard Tapie>, &lt;Financiere Faltas>,
&lt;Banque Indosuez> and Credit Lyonnais &lt;CRLP.PA>.
    The remaining 50 pct of TF1 is to be split between a 40-pct
stake to be offered to the general public and a 10-pct stake to
be offered to employees.

<TITLE>ALGERIAN, SPANISH FIRMS AGREE QUICKSILVER PRICE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ALGIERS, April 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Algerian and Spanish producers which
together meet 40 pct of the Western market's needs in
quicksilver have agreed to apply a minimum selling price of 300
dlrs per unit, the Algerian news agency APS said.
    The agreement was made during a meeting here last week
between Algeria's Entreprise Nationale des Non-ferreux et
Substances Utiles (ENOF) and Spain's Almaden to discuss the
market situation.
    The two firms "took note with regret that prices quoted by
some specialised publications do not reflect the reality of the
whole market since they take into account only part of the
deals made," a statement by ENOF said.
    The result is that the prices quoted are far away from two
firms' production costs.
    "They have thus decided that their selling price would not
be linked any more to the prices quoted by these publications
and that sales would be made at a minimum price of 300 dlrs fob
per jar, which is close to their production cost," the statement
said.
    It added that Turkish producers would join in when the two
firms meet again in Madrid later this month.
    The price of quicksilver on the London Metal Exchange
hovered around 200 dlrs this week.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>IEA SEES ONE PCT GROWTH IN 1987 OECD OIL DEMAND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, April 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Growth in oil consumption in the Western
industrialised countries is likely to slow to around one pct
this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International
Energy Agency (IEA) said.
    Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by around
one pct in first quarter 1987 to 35.9 mln bpd, the IEA said in
its Monthly Oil Market Report.
    Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from
transport fuels, as in 1986. But if average consumer prices are
higher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may be
below last year's 3.6 pct, it said.
    The IEA said that assuming crude oil and product prices
stay close to current levels, some destocking by end-users can
be expected. If that happens, natural gas will also regain some
of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, and there
may be slightly less growth in transport fuels.
    IEA estimates on April 1 put oil stocks in the OECD area at
428 mln tonnes, representing 98 days of forward consumption.
This is about the same level as at the begining of the year.
    The agency said this flat trend is explained by the
projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of
the year which offset a reduction in stocks.
    It said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell
by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the
year. This followed a small rise in January of 0.4 mln bpd but
a decline of 1.5 mln bpd in February and 2.5 mln bpd in March.
    It is possible that final data will show a larger draw,
particulary for March, it said. As crude production also fell,
there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported
stocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said.
    Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes
on April 1 against 316 mln on April 1 1986. Governments built
up strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in the
period.
    The year-on-year trend of government stock building is
continuing with year-on-year company stocks also rising, more
or less in line with consumption, after declining for five
years, the IEA noted.
    Oil stocks on land in the U.S. And Canada were put at 206.6
mln tonnes on April 1, down from the 214 mln tonnes on January
1 and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption,
respectively.
    Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes on April
1, down from the 154 mln on January 1 but still equivalent to
94 days of consumption.
    World oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mln
bpd to 45.2 mln bpd from 47.2 mln bpd in last quarter 1986.
    This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude
production to around 15.5 mln bpd in February/March from 16.5
mln bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from
centrally-planned Economies, the IEA said.
    Total OPEC crude oil supply was 15.8 mln bpd in the first
quarter, plus 1.4 mln bpd of NGLs, compared with 17.3 mln bpd
of crude in the last three months of 1986 and 17.9 mln average
for the whole of 1986. Supply from non-OPEC countries totalled
28 mln bpd, against 28.5 mln bpd in the fourth quarter 1986.
    A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast
3.3 mln bpd in March from 3.6 mln bpd in February was the
largest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA
said.
    Saudi Arabia"s Opec-assigned output quota is 4.133 mln bpd.

<TITLE>MARCH U.S. PURCHASING MANAGERS INDEX UP AT 53.9</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. economy in March improved at a
faster rate than in February, with the National Association of
Purchasing Management's composite index rising to 53.9 pct from
51.9 pct, the NAPM said.
    The first quarter average for the index also was 53.9 pct.
The NAPM said that, if this average were to continue for the
rest of 1987, it would be consistent with real gross national
product growth of about three pct.
    An index reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the
economy is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a
declining economy.
    The NAPM said the economic improvement was evident in all
of the indicators in the index except inventories, which
declined slightly.
    New orders rose sharply in March, with production also
higher. Vendor deliveries slowed, another sign that the economy
improved in March. Employment expanded for the first time since
August 1984.
    Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM's business survey
committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes
Inc &lt;PBI> said "the economy ended the first quarter with a
healthy, if not substantial improvement."
    Bretz said the sharp rise in the growth of new orders in
March assures a good beginning for the second quarter.
    Some 50 pct of the purchasing managers reported that they
were paying higher prices in March than at the end of 1986. Of
those paying higher prices now, the average increase was put at
2.5 pct.
    The estimated average price increase anticipated by members
for the remainder of 1987 is 2.1 pct. While prices continue to
rise, the NAPM said that most purchasers do not see them as
being significant.
    The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, based
on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders,
production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment.
    The monthly report is based on questions asked of
purchasing managers at 250 U.S. industrial companies.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>British securities house &lt;Barclays de

in Amsterdam, its first office in continental Europe.
    BZW, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Barclays Plc &lt;BCS.L>,
said in a statement the new company had been built on the
parent company's former Dutch subsidiary, Barclays Kol.
    The new company, &lt;Barclays de Zoete Wedd Nederland NV>,
will focus on trading in both Dutch and international equities
and will develop a full range of investment banking services.
    It will initially employ 29, aiming to increase numbers to
35 by the year-end, it said.
    BZW said its parent Barclays Bank had subsidiary companies
active on the stock exchanges of Zurich, Milan and Paris which
BZW planned to use to strengthen its presence in continental
Europe.
    Commenting on the move, BZW chairman Sir Martin Jacombe
said while international deregulation had turned London, New
York and Tokyo into "pivotal points for trading across time
zones, firms like BZW that seek to serve the world-wide
financial community must have a presence in Europe, not just in
the U.K."
    BZW currently employs some 2,000 staff in its offices in
Britain, Hong Kong, Tokyo, New York and Sydney.

<TITLE>U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - CAUTIOUS TRADING</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Martin Cherrin, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Bond trading is likely to remain
cautious in the near term with a possible downward price bias
as market participants focus on trends in the dollar, the
economy and Federal Reserve policy, economists said.
    Most expect the economy to continue showing modest gains,
that the dollar has more room to fall and that the Fed will
keep policy essentially steady, perhaps for several months.
    Until trends are clearer, "the market can only attempt to to
establish and hold a new trading range at higher interest
rates," said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
    Merrill Lynch economists Raymond Stone and Ward McCarthy
said that while the fundamentals generally bode for a healthy
investment climate, the market will have no confidence in this
environment until there is illumination of and confidence in
U.S. Dollar/trade policy.
    Salomon Brothers' Henry Kaufman said the bond market,
highly sensitized to dollar movements, could be encouraged if
currency markets seem to be stabilizing or if U.S. And overseas
economic growth is perceived as slowing sharply.
    "The crucial question, however, is how soon either of these
developments is likely to occur," Kaufman said.
    "Market uncertainties and the erosion of portfolio manager
confidence could continue portfolio selling pressure a while
longer," said Philip Braverman, chief economist at Irving
Securities Corp.
    However, Braverman said that, "from a longer term
perspective, current (bond) prices provide a buying
opportunity."
    Despite a nearly one-point bond price rebound Friday on
unexpectedly weak March employment data, key 30-year Treasury
bonds lost 2-1/4 points in price for the week as a whole and
Thursday's 7.93 pct closing yield was a 1987 high.
    Braverman said historical evidence suggests that a long
bond yield in the 7.93 pct area provides a basis for optimism.
Bonds closed at 7.86 pct on Friday.
    The Irving economist noted that three times last year, in a
similar "paroxysm of pessimism," the key bonds reached a similar
closing yield high. Within three to six weeks in each instance,
however, Braverman said bond prices recovered to bring the
yield down sharply by 63 to 82 basis points.
    Mitchell Held of Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co Inc said
that many portfolio managers now believe yields could approach
nine pct by midyear, which he considers unlikely.
    Held said that, since late 1986, Smith Barney analysts have
spoken about the risk that interest rates could move higher and
they continue to believe that an upward bias is likely to
persist over the next few months.
    Held said that in conversations with portfolio managers
last week there appeared to be increasing belief that the rate
rise had just begun and that yields could approach nine pct by
midyear. Naturally, that would mean a sharp bond price fall.
    "Yields could rise further over the next few months, but the
rise should be less than the 65 basis point rise we've seen
since the start of the year," Held said.
    Most expect Fed policy to be neutral for bonds near term.
    "The Fed is currently frozen into a fixed stance," said
economists at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.
    They said the Fed cannot tighten policy and push up
interest rates as might be appropriate to stabilize the dollar
and head off renewed inflationary psychology. That might harm
the fragile U.S. Economic expansion.
    The Lanston economists said, "The Fed cannot ease its policy
stance to both foster more rapid economic growth and calm
domestic and Third World debt jitters without the threat of
causing a further decline in the dollar."
    Minutes of February's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)
meeting released Friday showed that while the FOMC left policy
unchanged it was more inclined to firm rather than ease policy
later if conditions in the economy, foreign exchange or credit
markets warranted a policy shift.
    However, economists generally believe that continued fairly
sluggish U.S. Economic growth and the financial strains on U.S.
Banks resulting from their problem loans to developing
countries rule out any Fed policy firming.
    There is broad agreement among economists that the FOMC at
last Tuesday's meeting also left Fed policy unchanged.
    This week's U.S. Economic data are expected to have little
impact. February consumer instalment credit numbers are due on
Wednesday, with March producer price data out Friday.
    There may be mild relief in some quarters that the U.S.
Purchasing Managers Composite Index, a closely-watched economic
indicator, rose only to 53.9 pct in March from 51.9 pct. A
Friday rumor had put the number far higher. The index's first
quarter average also was 53.9 pct, translating into real GNP
growth of about three pct if continued through 1987.
    Federal funds traded at 5-15/16 pct late Friday and are
expected to open about there today with no Fed action seen.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>CAESARS WORLD BOARD APPROVES RECAPITALIZATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Caesars World Inc &lt;CAW> said its
directors unanimously approved a recapitalization plan under
which stockholders will get a cash distribution of 25 dlrs per
share via a one-time special cash dividend and will retain
their common stock ownership in Caesars World.
    Caesars World said it expects to raise the approximately
one billion dlrs needed to pay the 25 dlr per share dividend
and the expenses of recapitalization through around 200 mln
dlrs in bank borrowings and a public sale of approximately 800
mln dlrs of debt. Some outstanding debt will be retired.
    Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, Caesars' financial advisor, has
told the company it is confident it can arrange the entire
financing needed for the recapitalization.
    Henry Gluck, chairman and chief executive officer of the
hotel, casino and resorts company, said in a statement the
board believes the recapitalization plan is financially
superior to a 28 dlr a share tender offer by Martin Sosnoff.
    Gluck said the Caesars World board once again recommends
that shareholders reject the Sosnoff offer.
    The stock closed at 29.25 dlrs a share on Friday.
    "Our ability to restructure along these lines is possible
primarily because of the financial stability and the strong
operating results achieved by management in recent years," Gluck
said.
    He said that after the recapitalization takes effect,
proforma net income for the fiscal year ended July 31, 1988 is
expected to be about 28.7 mln dlrs.
    Fiscal 1988 primary earnings per share are projected to be
76 cents, based on about 37.8 mln in post-recapitalization
common and common-equivalent shares outstanding.
    Commenting on the company's longer term earnings outlook,
Gluck said "we project net income to increase to 86.2 mln dlrs
in 1992, reflecting increased operating income and lower
interest expense due to the retirement of 267 mln dlrs of debt
incurred in connection with the recapitalization."
    He said the company does not usually release projections,
but has done so now beause of the significance of the
recapitalization.
    Gluck said the recapitalization plan will be submitted for
stockholder approval at a special meeting expected in June.
    The plan will require the approval of stockholders and that
of the Nevada and New Jersey gaming regulatory authorities.
    As part of the plan, the company will change its state of
incorporation from Florida to Delaware by means of a merger of
Caesars World into a wholly owned subsidiary of the company.
    The new incorporation certificate and bylaws will provide
for, among other things, a "fair price" provision requiring that
certain transactions with interested 15 pct stockholders be
approved by an 80 pct vote of stockholders, excluding shares
held by such interested stockholders.
    Caesars World said in a statement that "the cash
distribution will result in a substantial deficit in
stockholders' equity." It did not give an estimate of the size
of this deficit.
    But the company said its financial advisors have said they
believe that after the recapitalization, Caesars World should
have the financial flexibility and resources necessary to
finance its current and projected operating and capital
requirements.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIAN GAS LIGHT CO COUNTER-BIDS FOR TMOC</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, April - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;The Australian Gas Light Co> (AGL) said it
will offer one share plus one dlr cash for every two shares in
oil and gas producer &lt;TMOC Resources Ltd> in a counter-bid to
the previously reported takeover offer by Santos Ltd &lt;STOS.S>.
    The offer values TMOC shares at 4.75 dlrs each, based on
AGL's closing price of 8.50 dlrs on Friday. TMOC shares jumped
to 4.60 dlrs on the announcement from its Friday closing price
of 4.15.
    The AGL offer, the third to be made for TMOC this year,
compares with the Santos cash offer of 4.00 dlrs a share.
    Based on TMOC's issued capital of 62.08 mln shares, the AGL
offer values the entire company at 249.9 mln shares.
    AGL said in a statement that it already holds 10.5 pct of
TMOC's issued capital. This compares with the Santos stake of
3.1 pct when it announced its bid in March 23.
    &lt;Elders Resources Ltd> began the auction for TMOC about
three months ago with an unsuccessful 2.55 dlrs a share
on-market offer that has since lapsed.
    AGL said its offer is above the upper end of the range of
values placed on TMOC by its advisers in the company's response
urging rejection of the Elders Resources bid.
    AGL said it will make the same offer for TMOC's convertible
notes. Accepting share and note holders will participate in
AGL's planned one-for-one bonus issue.
    It said TMOC is already a partner with AGL in the Alice
Springs to Darwin gas pipeline and has a number of businesses
complementary with those of AGL.
    AGL is the New South Wales natural gas utility while TMOC
has extensive onshore holdings, mainly in Queensland where it
owns the Moonie oil field and in the Northern Territory where
it operates and holds 43.75 of the Mereenie oil-gas field. It
also has interests in a number of gas or oil pipelines.

<TITLE>IEA FORECASTS SLOWER GROWTH IN OECD OIL DEMAND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, April 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Growth in oil consumption in the Western
industrialized countries is likely to slow to around one pct
this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International
Energy Agency said.
    Oil use in the 24 member countries of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) increased by around
one pct in the first quarter of 1987 to 35.9 mln barrels a day,
the IEA said in its latest monthly report.
    Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from
transport fuels, as was the case in 1986. But if average
consumer prices are higher than 1986, the rate of growth for
these fuels may be below last year's 3.6 pct.
    The IEA said assuming crude and product prices remain nar
current levels, some destocking by end-users can be expected.
    If that takes place, natural gas will also regain some of
the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, it said.
    IEA estimates on April one put oil stocks held in the OECD
area at 428 mln tonnes, or 98 days of forward consumption. This
is about the same as at the begining of the year.
    The agency said this flat trend is explained by the
projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of
the year which offset a reduction in stocks.
    Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes
on April one this year compared with 316 mln tonnes in calender
1986 while governments also built up their strategic stocks to
102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in 1986.
    The year-on-year trend of government stock building is
continuing with company stocks rising, more or less in line
with consumption, after declining for five years, IEA said.
    Oil stocks on land in the United States and Canada were put
at 206.6 mln tonnes down from the 214 mln tonnes on January one
and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption, respectively.
    Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes, down
from the 154 mln tonnes on January one but still equivalent to
94 days of consumption.
    The IEA said that initial estimates indicate that company
stocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first
quarter of the year. This followed a small rise in January of
400,000 bpd but a decline of 1.5 bpd in February and 2.5 bpd in
March.
    And it is possible that final data will show a larger draw,
particulary for March, it said.
    As crude production also fell, there is likely to have also
been a decline in non-reported stocks, particularly at sea, the
IEA said.
    World oil supply fell through the first quarter by about
two bpd to 45.2 bpd from 47.5 bpd in the last quarter of 1986.
    This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude
production to around 15.5 bpd in February/March from 16.5 bpd
in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from Centrally
Planned Economies, the IEA said.
    Total OPEC oil supply totalled 17.2 bpd in the first
quarter of 1987 compare with 19.3 bpd in the last three months
of 1986 while supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 bpd as
against 28.2 bpd in the same 1986 period.
    A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast
3.3 bpd in march from 3.6 bpd in February was the largest
factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA said.

<TITLE>PHILIPPINE COFFEE EXPORTS SEEN FALLING SHARPLY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     MANILA, April 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Philippine coffee exports are expected
to fall sharply due to a combination of the International
Coffee Organisation's (ICO) decision not to revive export
quotas and higher local prices, ICO Certifying Agency official
Dante de Guzman told Reuters.
    He said exporter registrations dropped from an average
weekly 500 tonnes in March to 45 tonnes last week, with exports
in coffee year 1986/87, ending September, forecast to total
about 8,000 tonnes against 48,000 in 1985/86.
     "Because of the relatively higher level of domestic prices,
it has become difficult to service exports," de Guzman said,
adding that most exporters are taking a wait and see attitude.
    Coffee production was expected to drop slightly to about
one mln bags of 60 kg each in the 1986/87 crop year ending June
from 1.1 mln bags last year, he said.

<TITLE>LEADING COCOA PRODUCERS DISCUSS INTERNATIONAL PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    YAOUNDE, April 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Leading cocoa producers will discuss
whether newly-agreed rules on an international cocoa buffer
stock will succeed in reversing a sharp fall in world prices
when they start four day's of talks here later today,
conference sources said.
    Another topic likely to be discussed at the twice-yearly
meeting of the Cocoa Producer Alliance (CPA) is the pact's
second line of market support -- a witholding scheme under
which exporters can take up to 120,000 tonnes of cocoa off the
market if buffer stock purchases fail to defend prices.
    The International Cocoa Organisation is due to discuss the
scheme at a meeting in June, and exporters could use the
Yaounde talks to work out a common position on the issue, the
sources said.
    Delegates will also be briefed on arrangements for an
international cocoa research conference due to take place in
Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic next month, CPA
secretary general D.S. Kamga said.
    The 11-member CPA include the world's top three producers
of Ivory Coast, Brazil and Ghana and accounts for around 80 pct
of world output.

is forecast to grow by nine pct in 1987, surpassing the
government's original forecast of eight pct and against a 12.5
pct rise in 1986, an Economic Planning Board report said.
    The report reviewing the country's economy in the first
three months of this year said year-on-year gnp was
provisionally estimated to have grown by about 12 pct in the
period, against a 10.5 pct growth in the same 1986 period.
    Board officials said the gnp rise in the January-March
period is due largely to increased exports, which totalled 9.34
billion dlrs against 6.9 billion a year earlier.

suffered considerable damage because of frost during a spell of
unusually cold weather in late March, the China Daily said.
    It said average temperatures for the last 10 days of March
in most of east China were three to five degrees centigrade
below average. Snow fell in Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei and Henan,
making early rice sowing difficult.
    Heavy snow blanketted central and south Jilin and north
Liaoning, leaving farmland too muddy for spring ploughing and
sowing, the paper said.
    The paper said rainfall during the last 10 days of March in
areas south of the Yangtze had been much higher than normal.
    Heavy rain fell last Sunday in parts of Guangdong, ending a
particularly arid dry season and marking the start of the flood
season, it said. It gave no further details.
    The New China News Agency said rain and snow in Henan had
improved the prospects for wheat, sown on 4.8 mln hectares, and
caused a drop in grain prices at rural fairs since late
February. It gave no 1986 figures for comparison.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Kuwait may re-register part of its
tanker fleet with foreign flag jurisdictions, including the
U.S. And USSR, in an attempt to protect them from Iranian
missile attacks in the Gulf war zone, U.S. Officials were
quoted by the New York Times as saying.
    The transfers would allow the country of registration to
escort Kuwaiti-owned ships in the Gulf. Kuwait had earlier
declined an offer of U.S. Naval escorts as too public an
admission of its need for protection, they said.
    Kuwait is also looking at flagging-out to European
registries, the officials said.
    Soviet flag tankers transporting Kuwaiti oil through the
Gulf may get Soviet escorts, the officials said.
    Kuwait had earlier considered having both USSR and U.S.
Escorts, but the U.S. Was unwilling to give the Soviet Union a
naval role in the region, the newspaper quoted the officials as
saying.
    Kuwait has backed Iraq in the seven-year war against Iran
and its ships have increasingly been the target of Iranian
attacks.
    The U.S. And Kuwait have been negotiating for over a month
on methods of protecting Kuwaiti ships.

<DATELINE>    BERNE, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Swiss consumer prices rose one pct in the
year to March, the same rise as in the year to February, and
against 0.9 pct in the year to March 1986, the Federal
Statistics Office said.
    In March alone, prices rose 0.1 pct after a 0.3 pct rise in
February.
    The March index, base 1982, was 109.7 against 109.5 in
February.
    The Statistics Office said the March increase reflected
rises in certain sectors such as food, clothing and household
goods and falls in transport, heating and lighting.
    Both home produced and imported goods rose by 0.1 pct
during the month. But over the year as a whole, domestically
generated inflation reached 2.5 pct, offset by a 2.8 pct drop
in imports.

    Of the total, 400 billion yen will yield 3.8502 pct on
sales from money houses to banks and securities houses in a
41-day repurchase accord maturing on May 19.
    Another 400 billion yen will yield 3.7991 pct in a 20-day

    The repurchase agreement yields compare with the 3.8125 pct
one-month, and 3.7500 pct three-week commercial bill discount
rates today.
    Tomorrow's surplus is attributable to government tax
allocations to local governments and public entities.
    The operation will put outstanding bill supply at about

<DATELINE>    MOSCOW, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Soviet Communist Party has criticised
the country's Grain Products Ministry for failing to ensure
proper grain storage, turning out poor quality bread and for
unsatisfactory book keeping, Pravda said.
    The party daily said that losses in the industry owing to
waste and theft amounted to 7.3 mln roubles over the last two
and a half years.
    The situation was particularly bad in the Central Asian
republic of Kazakhstan, which has been severely criticised
since the ousting of its veteran leader Dinmukhamed Kunayev
last December.
    Its new leader, Gennady Kolbin, has said that at times the
grain-growing republic has performed so badly that it has been
obliged to seek grain supplies from national reserves.
    Tass news agency announced yesterday that Grain Products
Minister Grigory Zolotukhin, 75, was being retired and replaced
by Alexander Budyka, a senior food industry official.
    Pravda added today that the crisis in the industry had been
drawn to Zolotukhin's attention and two of his deputies
reprimanded.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>COCOA BUFFER STOCK MAY FACE UPHILL BATTLE - TRADE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jane Merriman, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The International Cocoa Organization
(ICCO) buffer stock could face an uphill battle to halt the
downtrend in world cocoa prices when it begins buying
operations in the next few weeks, cocoa traders said.
    Traders said they believed buffer stock purchases could
reach 75,000 tonnes in a matter of weeks without lifting prices
significantly, given the amount of surplus cocoa overhanging
the market. The buffer stock may begin buying shortly as the
ICCO 10 day average indicator price is now at 1,578.03 Special
Drawing Rights (SDR) per tonne, below the 1,600 "must buy" level.
    Rules governing buffer stock operations were agreed last
month by the ICCO council. Buying will begin once the buffer
stock manager has completed preparations, traders said.
    Some traders said the buffer stock manager may delay buffer
stock buying until mid or end-April when changes in months used
to calculate the ICCO indicator may lift the 10 day average
above the 1,600 SDR "must buy" level.
    The ICCO indicator price is calculated from the average of
the second, third and fourth positions on the London and New
York futures markets. The daily price was 1,577.61 SDR per
tonne yesterday.
    Months used currently for the indicator are May, July and
September, but these are set to change to July, September and
December on April 15, prior to May becoming the New York spot
month, traders noted.
    The introduction of December into the calculations may lift
the daily SDR price as December is currently quoted about 75
stg above May on the London terminal market.
    But the buffer stock manager would have to wait for the
higher daily price to feed through into the 10-day average, the
indicator which governs his activities, traders said.
    "The buffer stock manager is obviously looking at the
implications of delaying until forward prices lift the
indicator since it might mean he has to buy less cocoa," an
analyst from a leading cocoa trade house said.
    Traders said the buffer stock purchases could reach 75,000
tonnes fairly quickly once buying starts. If purchases reach
this level within six months, buying is suspended pending an
ICCO council review of price ranges. But some cocoa market
watchers said the buffer stock may benefit from recent
forecasts for a poor Brazilian Bahia temporao crop at 1.5 mln
to two mln 60 kilo bags against initial expectations of up to
three mln.
    A lower than expected Brazilian crop may cut the 1986/87
world surplus to between 50,000 and 70,000 tonnes, compared
with a recent forecast by the ICCO statistics committee of
94,000 tonnes, traders said.
    In these circumstances, the buffer stock may only need to
buy between 20,000 and 30,000 tonnes to lift prices above the
"must buy" level.
    But some dealers said the ICCO buffer stock rules may put
constraints on how quickly and effectively the buffer stock
manager can remove cocoa from the market.
    The buffer stock system of price differentials set
according to quality and a 15 pct limit on purchases from
non-members could limit the buffer stock's scope for action,
dealers said.
    Most of the cocoa readily available to the buffer stock is
nearby in-store material of Malaysian and Ivory Coast origin.
    But the buffer stock can only buy 15 pct Malaysian cocoa as
Malaysia is not an ICCO member, while purchases of nearby cocoa
can only reach 40 pct in any one day, which forces the buffer
stock to buy some intermediate and forward shipment material.
    Limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby and non-member
cocoa will reduce the impact on terminal prices which are
pressured by the overhang of Malaysian material, traders said.
    Buffer stock purchases of forward shipment cocoa from
quality producers such as Ghana will have only a limited impact
on futures, but is likely to widen physical market premiums for
this cocoa over futures.
    Ghana's premium to the terminal has risen to about 50 stg
from 25 to 30 stg a month ago partly in anticipation of buffer
stock buying, dealers said.
    "The buffer stock may not help the terminal market, but will
provide a backstop for quality cocoas," one trader said.
    Traders cautioned that views on the impact of the buffer
stock were "all prognostication" and that no one could hope to
predict accurately what the result would be. Psychologically
buffer stock buying should help prices, but since the buffer
stock already holds a carryover of 100,000 tonnes from the
previous cocoa agreement and the market is in surplus, dealers
expressed doubts purchases can counter bearish pressure.
    In June the ICCO is due to discuss rules for a withholding
scheme as an additional market support mechanism.

<TITLE>FRENCH TREASURY TO REPAY 680 MLN FRANCS OF DEBT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The French treasury has decided to repay
680 mln francs of debt issued before 1950, the Finance Ministry
said.
    Seven issues, accounting for 0.13 pct of total state
domestic debt, would be redeemed by the Caisse d Amortisement
de la Dette Publique, the national debt amortisation fund, a
Ministry statement said.
    The Ministry said the debt rationalisation exercise,
similar to one carried out in 1958 and 1959, would take out of
circulation old issues which were expensive to manage and
difficult to trade because of their highly complex structure.
    Technical details of the operation would be announced in
the next few days.
    The securities to be redeemed would be the three pct
perpetual rente, five pct perpetual rente, four pct 1941-1960
redeemable rentes, 3.5 pct 1942-1952 redeemable rentes, three
pct 1942-1955 redeemable rentes, three pct 1945-1954 redeemable
rentes, and 4.5 pct 1933-1960 redeemable treasury bonds.
    The ministry said the operation would mainly benefit
long-term holders of the issues, mainly small investors and
small communes.
    The issues were difficult to trade because they comprised
securities of variable nominal value, it noted.

alumina plant in Greece, government spokesman Yannis Roubatis

    Roubatis told reporters the Soviet Union agreed to buy the
plant's entire annual output of 600,000 tonnes of alumina. More
details would be given later by Greek Industry Undersecretary
George Petsos, who was in Moscow.
    The project was due to start in 1986, but problems over
plans to sell some alumina to Bulgaria caused delays. The
Soviet Union, which was to take 400,000 tonnes, later agreed to
take the full production.

total of 800 billion yen worth of financing bills from its
holdings to help absorb a projected money market surplus of
1,300 billion yen, money traders said.
    Of the total, 400 billion yen will yield 3.8502 pct on
sales from money houses to banks and securities houses in a
41-day repurchase accord maturing on May 19.
    Another 400 billion yen will yield 3.7991 pct in a 20-day
repurchase pact maturing on April 28, they said.
    The repurchase agreement yields compare with the 3.8125 pct
one-month, and 3.7500 pct three-week commercial bill discount
rates today.
    Tomorrow's surplus is attributable to government tax
allocations to local governments and public entities.
    The operation will put outstanding bill supply at about
4,300 billion yen, they said.

<TITLE>NO INTERVENTION, DOLLAR FIXED AT 1.8218 MARKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bundesbank did not intervene as
the dollar was fixed lower at 1.8218 marks after 1.8243
yesterday, dealers said.
    Dealers said dollar trading was very quiet over the
European morning, with operators made wary by today's meeting
of the Group of Five finance ministers and central bank chiefs
ahead of the full IMF/World Bank session in Washington.
    It was undermined by remarks from U.S. Council of Economic
Advisers Chairman Beryl Sprinkel who told Iowa bankers the U.S.
Had no objective regarding the value of the dollar.
    Sprinkel also called the reference to stabilizing exchange
rates at about current levels, made at the Paris meeting on
February 22, a "vague statement," casting doubt on operators'
assumptions that a secret target level had been set.
    Sprinkel added that if West Germany and Japan made progress
to stimulate their economies as the Paris agreement envisaged,
"there would not be the necessity of significant declines in the
dollar."
    One dealer for a U.S.-based bank noted the dollar tended
easier after the remarks. "They were obviously regarded as being
negative. And if the market starts regarding anything that
comes out negatively then it means that the underlying
sentiment is negative," he said.
    Some early selling pressure softened the dollar's
undertone.
    Most operators overlooked intervention by the Bank of Japan
to support the dollar against selling in favour of the yen by
institutional investors and overseas operators, dealers said.
    After the strong focus on the dollar/yen rate in recent
weeks up to the end of the Japanese financial year on March 31,
interest and activity was likely to switch, dealers said.
    "We can start to look at a point in time where the interest
shifts away from dollar/yen and more into dollar/mark and the
other European currencies," the U.S. Bank dealer said.
    Despite the softer undertone, traders would remain wary of
taking significant new positions during the Washington
meetings, dealers said. Aside from the G-5 session today,
Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl is due to meet the German
Affairs group on international monetary issues later.
    The mark gained some strength from news the Bundesbank set
a new securities repurchase tender to add money market
liquidity at a fixed 3.80 pct, unchanged from those over the
last several weeks. Some expectation had been growing that it
might cut the rate or move to a minimum interest rate tender,
signalling a desire for a slight easing in credit policy.
    Bundesbank central bank council member Lothar Mueller said
the Bundesbank had not given up its focus on money supply. A
monetary policy which took into account exchange rates and
capital flows could not be confused with an exchange-rate
oriented policy, he said, contradicting some growing sentiment.
    Sterling eased a touch to 2.950 marks at the fixing from
2.957. The yen's unabated strength, despite the intervention,
brought it up to 1.2555 marks per 100 from yesterday's 1.2480.
    The Swiss franc rose to a fix of 120.515 marks per 100 from
120.180. The French franc eased to 30.055 marks per 100 after
30.060, Belgian franc was little changed at 4.829 marks per
100.

<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Fire protection and security group
Wormald International Ltd &lt;WOIA.S> said British-listed &lt;Holmes
Protection Group Inc> has agreed to issue it with 6.15 mln
common shares of one U.S. Cent par-value at 1.72 stg each.
    The two groups have also begun exploratory talks on a
possible merger of the Holmes business with the compatible
businesses of Wormald, comprising some or all of its fire
protection and security businesses in the Americas and Europe,
Wormald said in a statement.
    The issue of shares in the New York-based Holmes is
conditional upon shareholder approval at a general meeting.
    Wormald said its stake will represent 9.99 pct of Holmes'
existing issued shares and 9.09 pct of the enlarged capital.
    The issue will raise 10.6 mln stg which will be used for
further development of the Holmes business.
    Wormald said the businesses of the two groups are largely
complementary in terms of both geographical spread and the
nature of their activities, with Holmes concentrating on
burglar alarms and Wormald on fire systems.
    Holmes's operations are concentrated in and around New York
amd Miami. It earned 11 mln U.S. Dlrs pre-tax in its last
reported full year, 1985, and 6.0 mln in first half 1986.

<TITLE>SUMITA SEES REAGAN BONDS FEASIBLE, SAYS NEWSPAPER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said
he would support the issuance of Reagan bonds, yen-denominated
U.S. Government securities, if it was considered appropriate, a
Japanese daily paper reported.
    The Sankei Shimbun quoted Sumita as saying in an interview
"It (Reagan bond) is a very feasible idea," speaking in the
context of the effectiveness of such bonds in halting the
dollar's decline.
    Asked how he would respond to the idea if it were brought
up at any Group of Five meeting in Washington later this week,
the paper quoted him as saying "I will back it up."
    But Sumita said the market still has confidence in the
dollar, and one must be careful in associating the current
dollar decline with anything like a free fall, the paper said.
    In 1978, the administration of then president Jimmy Carter
floated government securities worth four billion dlrs in marks
and Swiss francs to try to halt the the dollar's depreciation.
    A Bank of Japan spokesman confirmed that the newspaper
report was basically correct.
    But a senior central bank official told Reuters that as far
as he knew, the idea was not being seriously considered now,
either in the U.S. Or in Japan.

<TITLE>KUWAIT MAY RE-REGISTER GULF TANKERS - NEWSPAPER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Kuwait may re-register part of its
tanker fleet with foreign flag jurisdictions, including the
U.S. And USSR, in an attempt to protect them from Iranian
missile attacks in the Gulf war zone, U.S. Officials were
quoted by the New York Times as saying.
    The transfers would allow the country of registration to
escort Kuwaiti-owned ships in the Gulf. Kuwait had earlier
declined an offer of U.S. Naval escorts as too public an
admission of its need for protection, they said.
    Kuwait is also looking at flagging-out to European
registries, the officials said.
    Soviet flag tankers transporting Kuwaiti oil through the
Gulf may get Soviet escorts, the officials said.
    Kuwait had earlier considered having both USSR and U.S.
Escorts, but the U.S. Was unwilling to give the Soviet Union a
naval role in the region, the newspaper quoted the officials as
saying.
    Kuwait has backed Iraq in the seven-year war against Iran
and its ships have increasingly been the target of Iranian
attacks.
    The U.S. And Kuwait have been negotiating for over a month
on methods of protecting Kuwaiti ships.

<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Chase-AMP Bank Ltd> said it will lower
its prime lending rate to 17.75 pct from 18.25, effective
tomorrow.
    The bank is the first to lower its prime rate below the 18
pct set by a few banks in the last few days in a continuation
of a downward trend which began late last month.
    Other prime rates range from 18.25 to 18.5 pct, with the
majority on 18.25.
    The bank said the reduction reflected the recent downturn
in money market rates, the improved economic outlook and
adequate liquidity in the second quarter tax rundown period.

<DATELINE>    LUXEMBOURG, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Industrial production in the European
Community (EC) in January showed no growth compared with
January 1986, the EC statistics office, Eurostat, said in a
report.
    It said the EC industrial production index, base 1980,
stood at 103.9 in both months.
    EC officials said while the lack of growth may have been
due in part to the icy weather which gripped large parts of the
EC in January, it also reflects a worrying trend.
    Eurostat said for the last three months for which figures
are known, industrial output rose by only 0.9 pct compared with
the year-earlier period.
    Annual growth in the 12 months to January averaged about
1.8 pct, well below the 2.8 pct figure recorded in the 12
months ending last June, the office said.

<TITLE>BP SCOTTISH REFINERY SET TO RESTART THIS WEEK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The British Petroleum &lt;BP.L> Co Plc's
refinery at Grangemouth, Scotland, shut down after an explosion
and fire in the hydrocracker on March 22, will probably be back
in operation towards the week-end, a refinery spokesman said.
    He said the refinery will resume at about half its 178,500
barrels per day (bpd) capacity, as work on overhauling the
North Side of the complex, which began at the end of January,
will not be completed before the end of April.
    He said the refinery had been closed for longer than
originally expected due to the lengthy safety checks being
carried out prior to restarting.
    The explosion and fire, in which one worker was killed,
caused extensive damage to the central part of the 32,000
hydrocracker and the spokesman said today this unit would be
out of operation for several months. The remainder of the
refinery, including the 19,000 catalytic cracker, was
undamaged.
    He said inquiries into the accident, which happened while
the hydrocracker was not in operation, were continuing.
    In an earlier incident, two people were killed in an
explosion and fire at the refinery on March 13.

<TITLE>BRITAIN WARNS JAPAN OVER TRADE ROW</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rich Miller, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>British corporate affairs minister Michael
Howard told Japan to resolve the row over the U.K. Firm Cable
and Wireless Plc's &lt;CAWL.L> shareholding in a new Japanese
telecommunications company or face an abrupt deterioration in
trade relations.
    In meetings with both the foreign and telecommunications
ministers Howard said he expressed deep concern about the way
Tokyo had handled the dispute and about the continuing trade
imbalance between the two countries.
    "I put it to the (post and telecommunications) minister that
I was sure he did not want to be responsible for an abrupt
deterioration in the trading relations of our countries which
would have widespread reverberations elsewhere in the world,"
Howard told reporters.
    "He listened very carefully and I have little doubt the
message got home," he added.
    British frustration over the lopsided trade balance -
nearly six billion dlrs in Japan's favour last year - has
reached boiling point over the telecommunications issue, Howard
said.
    Howard has accused Japan of trying to shut out Cable and
Wireless from having a major role in the international
telephone market in Japan.
    "I want a fair crack of the whip for Cable and Wireless as I
want a fair crack of the whip for Britain generally in trading
relations," Howard said. "We simply aren't prepared to continue
to accept the imbalance which has been the position for such a
long time."
    Post and Telecommunications Ministry officials were unable
to comment on Howard's meeting with their minister.
    But Foreign Ministry officials said Foreign Minister
Tadashi Kuranari said that British exports to Japan are
increasing, but acknowledged the continuing imbalance in trade.
    Kuranari said he wants everyone in the telecommunications
dispute, including Cable and Wireless, to be satisfied.
    Howard told reporters that Britain was actively considering
possible retaliatory measures if it did not get its way on the
telecommunications issue.
    "There are measures which are under consideration if we
continue to suffer from the imbalance in our trading relations,"
he added, but gave no details.
    He said he had received a reassuring response from the
Japanese he has spoken with.
    "But of course we've had reassuring signs from the Japanese
for quite some time," he added. "What I've made plain is we
expect to see action."
    Howard ruled out using powers in Britain's Financial
Services bill to retaliate against unfair trade practices.
Those powers, which allow London to ban foreign financial firms
like banks from Britain, are designed to ensure U.K. Firms
equal access to overseas financial markets.

<TITLE>CARDINAL INDUSTRIES &lt;CDNI> RESTATES NET LOWER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    VERNON, Conn., April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cardinal Industries Inc said it
restated earnings for the first nine months of 1986 to 235,000
dlrs, or nine cts per share, from 485,000 dlrs, or 18 cts,
reported previously due to the failure of an automated
accounting system installed in mid-year and replaced in the
fourth quarter.
    The company said its Reliance segment sustained a
significant operating loss for the full year 1986 due to the
accounting problems and increased promotional and advertising
expenses.  For the full year, it said it earned 284,000 dlrs,
or 10 cts a share, up from 271,000 dlrs, or 10 cts, in 1985.
    Cardinal Industries said revenues for the year were 30.7
mln dlrs, up from 23.0 mln dlrs in 1985.
    The company said for the first quarter of 1987, earnings
were about 48,000 dlrs, up from 13,000 dlrs or nil per share in
the year ago period.  The year-ago first quarter earnings,
however, have been restated from 101,000 dlrs or four cts per
share.  It said sales for the first quarter were about
8,363,000 dlrs, up from 6,636,000 dlrs.
    For the first half of 1986, the company said it restated
earnings to 141,000 dlrs or five cts per share from 340,000
dlrs or 12 cts per share reported previously.

<DATELINE>    SADDLE BROOK, N.J., April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Michigan General Corp said
holders of 75 pct of its outstanding 10-3/4 pct senior
subordinated debentures due December 1, 1998, have indicated
their intention to tender under the company's current exchange
offer and to reach an agreement with the company.
    It said it hopes to conclude negotiations with the
debenture holders and its lenders and to conclude the exchange
offer as soon as possible.
    Michigan General in March had said that the exchange offer
would be conditioned on 90 pct acceptance and on its lender
waiving or providing relief from loan agreement defaults.
    Michigan General had also said that the offer would be
conditioned on ratification of amendments to the indenture
governing the 10.75 pct debentures by holders of two thirds of
the issue.
    It had said that if the offer and talks with its lender did
not succeed, it would probably have to file for bankruptcy law
protection.
    Michigan General is offering to exchange 500 dlrs of
increasing rate senior subordinated notes due March 1, 1992,
200 dlrs of non-interest bearing delayed convertible senior
subordinated notes due March 1, 1997 and 2 shares of two dlr
delayed convertible preferred stock with a liquidation value of
25 dlrs a share for each 1,000 dlrs of the debentures.

Prices paid were at, or above, the prevailing intervention feed
wheat price of 120.71 stg per tonne.
    Grain traders said a large part of the tonnage on offer was
in stores, which would mean high transport costs to deficient
areas. The European Commission recently made available 70,000
tonnes for next week's tender.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>PALM OIL OUTPUT SEEN DROPPING SHARPLY - OIL WORLD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HAMBURG, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Malaysian and Indonesian palm oil
production is likely to drop sharply this year, due to lower
yields, the Hamburg-based newsletter Oil World said.
    The publication expects total Malaysian output during
Jan/Sept 1987 to decline by eight pct to 3.05 mln tonnes. For
East Malaysia, it put production during the period at 297,000
tonnes after 312,000 a year earlier and for West Malaysia 2.75
mln compared with just over 3.0 mln during Jan/Sept 1986.
    It said new plantings had slowed markedly in both
countries, but the effects of this will not be felt until
1988-90.
    Above normal yields during recent years resulted in trees
reacting to the stress by changing the sex ratio to more male
inflorescences and/or aborting more female, Oil World said.
    Yields per hectare are also likely to be adversely affected
this year by insufficient rain up to 25 months ago. This could
especially affect trees in West Malaysia during April/June,
while in East Malaysia the impact will be in February/April and
July/Dec, and in Indonesia July/Sept.
    Last year's cut in fertilizer use will hit this year's
yields and bigger effects are expected within the next three
years, Oil World said without elaborating.
    Opening stocks in West Malaysia at the start of this year
were put at only 565,000 tonnes compared with 914,000 in
January 1986, Oil World said.
    West Malaysian net exports are therefore expected to drop
500,000 tonnes to 2.54 mln during Jan/Sept, while those of East
Malaysia are likely to decline by 10 pct to 280,000 tonnes.
    Indonesian palm oil production is forecast to fall about
eight pct during Jan/May, but to rise from June on. Overall
Indonesian output during Jan/Sept is forecast to rise three pct
to 933,000 tonnes. Indonesian stocks as of April 1, however,
are put at only 65,000 tonnes compared with 160,000 a year ago.
    Indonesian export commitments and domestic requirements are
both running at high levels, Oil World said, and it expects the
country's imports to reach a record 110,000 tonnes during
Jan/Sept. The bulk of this will arrive during Feb/May, ahead of
the April elections and the religious Ramadan festival
throughout May, it said.
    Indonesian net exports, therefore, may fall by 29 pct to
350,000 tonnes, Oil World said. The possibility that recent
Indonesian palm oil purchases will not actually enter the
country but be transshipped to other countries to fulfill
Indonesia's export orders cannot be ruled out, it said.

<TITLE>HUTTON &lt;EFH> ENDS PUROLATOR &lt;PCC> BID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WILTON, Conn., April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Emery Air Freight Corp said it has
entered into an agreement with E.F. Hutton Group Inc EFH under
which Hutton will terminate its merger agreement with Purolator
Courier Corp and its pending 35-dlr-per-share tender offer,
effective April 13.
    Under its merger agreement, Hutton has the right to
unilaterally terminate the merger agreement under certain
circumstances, including its receipt of less than 66-2/3 pct of
Purolator shares or the start of a higher competing tender
offer, such as Emery's competing 40 dlr per share offer for
Purolator stock.
    Yesterday, Hutton's PC Acquisition Corp subsidiary extended
its tender offer, which was to have expired at midnight, for
two more days.  It said it only about 450,000 shares, or 6.5
pct, of Purolator shares had been tendered and not withdrawn,
down from an 11.5 pct interest held earlier.
    Emery's bid expires April 28.
    Emery said pending the termination of PC Acquisition's
merger agreement, PC has released Purolator from an agreement
not to discuss Emery's acquisition proposal with Emery. Emery
said as a result it is renewing its request that Purolatr enter
into merger negotiations with it.
    Emery said if it were to acquire 51 pct of Purolator shares
or control of the Purolator board, it has agreed not to dispute
PC Acquisition's right to receive fees that Purolator agreed to
pay if PC were unsuccessful in acquiring control of Purolator
due to the acquisition of control by another party.
    The company said it has also agreed to let Purolator pay
all of PC Acquisition's documented expenses in connection with
the merger agreement up to three mln dlrs and Emery has agreed
to pay the amounts itself should Purolator fail to do so.

<TITLE>RUDING AGAINST FURTHER DOLLAR FALL, TRADE CURBS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Shifts in domestic economic policy,
not a further fall in the dollar or trade restrictions, are the
key to reducing imbalances in trade and payments, Dutch Finance
Miniister H. Onno Ruding said.
    Ruding told a meeting of the World Trade Forum here that
protectionism would naturally lead to retaliation and aggravate
the problems of heavily indebted developing countries.
    "The main contribution towards resolving the still enourmous
U.S. trade deficit is not repeat not a further fall in the
dollar, is not still more protectionism in your country."
    "No, it is - like in other countries - changes in domestic
economic and financial policies," Ruding said.
    Ruding said he was less worried about a crisis of the
weakening dollar than he was in January before the Paris accord
to stabilize foreign exchange rates.
    He said the highest priority should be given to policy
changes in the United States, especially reducing the budget
deficit and encouraging domestic savings.
    But he said other countries, such as Japan and West
Germany, also needed to take greater steps toward reducing
their trade surpluses.

<TITLE>VOLCKER WARNS AGAINST SIZEABLE DLR DECLINE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul
Volcker said a further large drop in the value of the dollar
could be counterproductive for world economic growth.
    Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, Volcker
said that Europe and Japan were slowing exports and that growth
in those countries was also decreasing.
    "In that kind of situation, further sizeable depreciation
of the dollar could well be counterproductive," he said.
    Domestic expansion in foreign industrial countries has not
been enough to offset the effects of slower exports, Volcker
said.
    On the value of the dollar, Volcker said he could not say
whether it should be higher or lower to restore balance in
trade.
    "What we do know is that a substantial exchange rate
adjustment has already been made," he said.
    "That adjustment should be large enough, in a context of a
growing world economy and fiscal restraint in the United
States, to support the widespread expectations of a narrowing
in the real trade deficit in the period ahead," he said.
    Volcker said U.S. exports were now growing substantially
while import growth should slow.
    Volcker said that to improve the trade deficit with a
minimum of inflationary pressure, the United States would have
to slow its spending growth.
    It would also have to achieve a better balance between
investment and domestic savings if it wants to be able to
dispense with foreign capital.
    "The constructive way to work in the needed direction would
be to reduce our budget deficit, year by year, paving the way
for improvements in our trade accounts," he said.
    Relying on depreciation of the dollar alone would risk
renewed inflation, he said.

<TITLE>WALL STREET STOCKS/MARION LABS &lt;MKC></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Marion Laboratories Inc's stock rose
sharply today after the company presented a bullish earnings
scenario at a meeting for pharmaceutical analysts Monday,
traders and analysts said.
    The company said it expects earnings for fiscal 1987,
ending June 30, to rise more than 75 pct over a year ago.
    That pronouncement encouraged analyst David Crossen of
Sanford C. Bernstein and Co to raise his earnings estimates for
the company to 1.28 dlrs a share in 1987, compared to his
previous estimate of 1.20 dlrs a share. Last year the company
earned 70 cts a share.
    Marion's stock gained 3-1/4 to 75-1/2.
    At the meeting of pharmaceutical analysts, Marion's
president Fred Lyons Jr. said Wall Street eanrings estimates of
1.10-1.15 dlrs a share for fiscal 1987 "are expected to cause
even the aggressive side of this range to be 10 to 15 cts low."
    Lyons said the strong performance in the second half of
this year will result from the fourth quarter introduction of
90 mg and 120 mg Cardizem tablets. Analyst Crossen said that
Cardizem, which treats angina, is also expected to be approved
for the treatment of hypertension by the end of the year.
    Crossen said "because Marion is still just a small company,
the growth of Cardizem is having a big impact on the bottom
line." He raised fiscal 1988 earnings estimates to 2.15 dlrs a
share from his previous estimate of 2.05 dlrs a share.
    "The company has a broad new product pipeline in the
industry and as far as I am concerned, it is the most
innovative company in the business," he said.
    For the five years through 1991, Crossen expects Marion to
have a growth rate of 55 pct.

<TITLE>U.S. CALLS FOR GREATER GATT CHECKS ON TRADE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GENEVA, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States has appealed for
stronger powers for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) to enforce world trade rules.
    The call by U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Michael Smith
at a special committee meeting into the future of GATT follows
a series of bilateral trade rows which have clouded efforts by
the 93-nation body to promote fair trade.
    Today's meeting was part of the Uruguay trade round
launched by ministers last September. The round, which covers
13 areas of trade in agriculture, manufactured goods and
services will take four years to negotiate.
    Smith called for boosting GATT's links with financial
institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World
Bank. He also urged greater involvement of trade ministers to
ensure the success of the Uruguay Round.
    "The GATT as an institution needs to be strengthened to
assure that the GATT plays its proper role in management of the
world trading system and the global economy," Smith said.
    "Rules can and will be ignored if the institution is weak,
or perceived as unable to adapt to the changing world economy."
    He also also urged that member states be accountable to
each other for their trade policies.
    Smith, who flies to Brussels today for talks with European
Community (EC) officials, told Reuters the committee wanted to
stress GATT's importance and did not discuss specifics.
    "We are interested in more periodic ministerial
involvement...Whether in formal or informal meetings," he said.
    GATT's ruling council is due to hear a complaint from the
12-nation EC on April 15 about the U.S.-Japanese accord on
semiconductors. The EC charges the accord breached GATT trade
rules by allowing Tokyo to set minimum prices for Japanese
chips sold in third countries and is requesting a GATT dispute
panel be set up to review the agreement.
    President Reagan, who strongly supported the Uruguay trade
round to promote freer trade, has said Washington will impose
tariffs against Japanese electronic goods.
    He said Tokyo had not shown willingness to open its markets
to U.S. Exports.

<TITLE>VOLCKER URGES QUICK AID TO DEBTOR NATIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul
Volcker said that debtor nations have made much progress in
laying the groundwork for economic growth, but a solution to
world debt difficulties was endangered by inaction on new
financing.
    "There is clearly a danger that adequate financing
arrangements are not being negotiated and put in place in a
timely way," Volcker told the Senate Banking Committee.
    The borrowing countries need to be able to proceed with
confidence that the necessary funds will be available to them,
he said.
    Brazil has the potential for becoming a leading world
economic power, but it is in a difficult position today,
Volcker said.
    He said it will take a concerted effort to regularize
Brazil's external payments.
    "The key prerequisite is clearly in the hands of Brazilian
authorities," he said.
    Both Brazil and its creditors have a strong incentive to
work together, Volcker said.
    Regarding trade imbalances, Volcker said that it was
critically important that markets be kept open by the
industrial nations.
    In addition, the United States must reduce its budget
deficit and foreign nations need to provide stimulus to their
domestic economies, Volcker said.
    "We need time for those actions and the earlier
depreciation to work their effects," he said.

<TITLE>BUNDESBANK RETAINS MONEY SUPPLY POLICY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bundesbank council member Lothar
Mueller said the bank has not given up its money supply policy
and that restraining money supply growth does not always mean
pushing up interest rates.
    Mueller said in an article for the Boersen Zeitung
financial daily that a monetary policy which took into account
exchange rate expectations and capital flows could not be
confused with an exchange rate oriented policy.
    The article followed international press speculation that
the Bundesbank had abandoned money supply targetting in favour
of an exchange rate policy.
    Mueller, a member of the Bundesbank council in his position
as president of the regional state central bank in Bavaria,
noted that the Bundesbank's decision in January to cut leading
interest rates amid continuing strong monetary growth had led
some people to think it was dropping monetary targetting.
    "Simply to ignore the external economic context would be
risky and dangerous for monetary policy," he explained.
    Mueller said the cuts in official interest rates had put an
end to interest rate speculation. The Bundesbank could now
assume that upward pressure on the mark would ease and currency
inflows slow down.
    Lower money market rates, achieved by widening short and
long term interest rate differentials, also encouraged
investors to re-invest funds parked in liquid accounts, Mueller
said.
    The measures therefore aimed clearly at bringing monetary
growth back onto the desired path, he said.
    "Finally, of course, and there is no need to keep this
quiet, the cut in interest rates was also in line with the
changed economic situation of the last few months," he added.
    "All in all, the Bundesbank in no way abandoned its money
supply policy with the January discount rate cut, despite
suppositions to the contrary," Mueller said.
    "Keeping money supply developments in check is not always
synonymous with raising interest rates, especially when
excessive liquidity due to inflows from abroad, rather than
growth in bank credits, is the cause of rising monetary
holdings of non-banks," Mueller said.
    Now that West Germany no longer ran large external deficits
other concepts were needed for monetary policy.
    Mueller said it would be both difficult and dangerous for
monetary policy to pursue a specific mark/dollar exchange rate.
    In any case, the exchange rate partly depends on U.S.
Currency and budgetary policy and the U.S. Economy, he said.
    But an exchange rate orientation would also mean the end of
a strict stability policy because both interest rates and
liquidity would be affected by required currency intervention
and could no longer be steered autonomously by the Bundesbank.
    Even interest rates are not in the centre of the
Bundesbank's considerations, but reflect competition and other
market conditions, Mueller said.
    A cut in bank liquidity will not directly influence central
bank money stock, the Bundesbank's main money supply indicator.
    This does not reflect banking liquidity, but the liquidity
of industry and households which cannot be directly reached
with the Bundesbank's instruments, Mueller said.
    The less dependent non-banks are on bank credits, the
harder it is to steer money supply. This has increasingly been
the case recently, because non-banks have received considerable
sums from current account surpluses and capital imports.
    "If the Bundesbank had tried to brake the money supply rise
with higher interest rates, as would have been appropriate if
credit was growing excessively, it would not only have missed
its target but probably even set off further inflows," he said.
    Mueller said growth in money supply was still too high.
    In the last three months money stock grew at an annual rate
of seven pct, down from 10 pct in the previous quarter.
    The growth curve has therefore come closer to the three to
six pct 1987 target corridor for central bank money stock
growth, pointing to the success of the current policy, he said.
    But high monetary stocks can be a warning sign and there
should be no change in priorities. "Monetary policy must be
first and foremost stability policy and successful stability
policy is money supply policy -- nothing else," he said.

Volcker said international policymakers should make improving
the stability of exchange rates a major priority.
    In testimony before a Senate Banking subcommittee, Volcker
said he does not have any specific proposals for improving
exchange rate stability, but thought it was worthy goal.
    "I do think we ought to be thinking about and working toward
greater exchange rate stability," Volcker said. "I think that the
objective of greater exchange rate stability ought to loom

<TITLE>ITALY SAYS G-7 GIVES CHANCE TO VERIFY TOKYO ACCORD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>This week's Group of Seven (G-7) meeting in
Washington provides an opportunity to verify an accord reached
at the Tokyo summit last May to include Italy and Canada in
Group of Five (G-5) talks on management of the international
monetary system and related issues, the Italian Treasury said.
    It said in a statement the G-7 meeting, which Italy plans
to attend, will provide a forum for considering the Tokyo
accord in the light of events in Paris in February this year.
    On February 22, Italy boycotted a meeting in Paris of its
G-7 partners - the United States, Japan, West Germany, France,
Britain and Canada - after being excluded from an earlier
session of talks involving G-5 members.
    Today's statement from the Italian Treasury said-
    "Nobody denies the existence of G-5 but we should like it to
be remembered that the Tokyo accords provided for the
enlargement of the group to Italy and Canada whenever "the
management or the improvement of the international monetary
economic policy measures are to be discussed or dealt with.'"
    Italy refused to attend the Paris G-7 meeting on the
grounds that G-5, grouping the United States, Japan, West
Germany, France and Britain, had reduced Italy's role to rubber
stamping agreements already taken.
    The Italian Treasury said today that Italy was "certain that
this time incidents would not occur."
    But it said it would be opportune to look in depth at the
role and the procedures of G-7 in relation to those of G-5.

<TITLE>KUWAIT SAID SEEKING FOREIGN PROTECTION FOR OIL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Kuwait has asked at least four
countries, including the United States, Soviet Union, Britain
and China, for temporary use of their flags or tankers to
protect Kuwaiti oil shipments in the troubled Persian Gulf,
Reagan Administration officials said.
    The officials confirmed a New York Times report that Kuwait
wants to transfer some of its oil tankers to U.S. or Soviet
registration in hopes Iran would be reluctant to launch new
"Silkworm" missiles at superpower flags.
    The United States has vowed to keep the gulf open to
international oil traffic and has warned Tehran against using
the Chinese-made missiles recently installed in Iran near the
mouth of the gulf.
    "They (the Kuwaitis) have also asked Britain, China and
possibly some other European countries to lease tankers to
carry their oil," one of the administration officials, who asked
not to be identified, told Reuters.
    The United States is considering the request to temporarily
transfer Kuwaiti ships to American registration, but such a
move could create insurance and other problems, the officials
said.
    U.S. defense officials told Reuters yesterday that Kuwait
had decided for at least the time being not to accept a U.S.
offer to use American warships to escort its tankers in the
gulf, where both Iran and Iraq have been attacking shipping.

<TITLE>ROLLS APPROACHES FLOAT WITH PROFITS SET TO RISE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Iain Pears, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>State-owned engine maker &lt;Rolls Royce
Plc> launches its prospectus for privatisation tomorrow with
many analysts forecasting higher profits this year. But it is
likely to miss contracts to power the proposed &lt;Airbus
Industrie> A340 aircraft.
    The company's so-called "pathfinder prospectus" gives all the
details of its stock market flotation except for the price at
which shares will be offered.
    Last month, the company announced that pretax profits rose
in 1986 to 120 mln stg from 81 mln the year before.
    Brokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd, BZW, sees 155 mln profit
for 1987.
    Analyst Tim Harris of Phillips and Drew said rising profits
and a low tax charge would be offset by the fact that Rolls
operated in a sector which traditionally attracted low ratings.
    Assuming the company was valued at around eight times
earnings, this would give a selling price valuing it at about
1.2 billion, though he said the recent good performance of the
aerospace sector could nudge this figure upwards.
    BZW is currently forecasting a higher sale price at between
1.5 billion and 1.7 billion.
    The price will be increased by it being likely to have much
of its debt wiped off by a government anxious to assure the
company's health when it has to fend for itself. Rolls was
rescued from bankruptcy and taken into state ownership in 1971.
    When the government announced the sale, it said it would
inject permanent capital equivalent to net debt -- around 250
mln stg at end-1986 -- into the company.
    Analysts noted this was necessary to ensure Rolls a credit
rating to match those of its main competitors such as General
Electric Co &lt;GE.N> and United Technologies Corp's &lt;UTX.N> Pratt
and Whitney unit.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Reserve is expected to
intervene in the government securities market to supply
temporary reserves indirectly via customer repurchase
agreements, economists said.
    They said the Fed is expected to execute anywhere from
1.5-2.0 billion dlrs of customer repos to offset seasonal
pressures on bank reserves.
    Federal funds, which averaged 6.20 pct yesterday, opened at
6-1/8 pct and remained there in early trading.

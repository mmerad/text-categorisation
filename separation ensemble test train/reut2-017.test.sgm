<TITLE>SEC WARNS SECURITIES DEALERS ON HIGH MARK-UPS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Securities and Exchange
Commission reminded securities dealers that its mark-up
disclosure requirements also applies to transactions on
zero-coupon securities.
    Dealers and brokers are required by U.S. securities law to
disclose their mark-ups if they are excessive, the SEC said in
a public notice.
    Further, excessive mark-ups on securities transactions,
whether disclosed or not, violate the rules of the national
Association of Securities Dealers Inc and Municipal Securities
Rulemaking Board, it said.
    In a separate action, the SEC filed a friend-of-the-court
brief in a private civil case involving a complaint against
Merrill Lynch over excessive mark-ups on zero-coupon bonds. The
case is being appealed to the U.S. Appeals Court.
    The lower court dismissed the complaint, finding antifraud
provisions of securities laws do not prohibit undisclosed
excessive mark-ups on securities transactions.
    The SEC is urging the appeals court to reverse the
decision, citing its nearly 50 year-old position that
undisclosed excessive mark-ups by securities dealers violate
the general antifraud provisions of securities laws.

<TITLE>FED DATA PROVIDE NEW EVIDENCE OF TIGHTER POLICY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alan Wheatley, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. banking data released today are
too distorted to draw sweeping conclusions about monetary
policy, but they do support the market's assumption that the
Federal Reserve has started to tighten its grip on credit,
economists said.
    "It's clear that the Fed has firmed somewhat. Discount
window borrowings, net free reserves, the Fed funds rate
average and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistent
with a modest tightening," said Dana Johnson of First Chicago
Corp.
    Johnson, and several other economists, now estimate that
the Fed funds rate should trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct.
    Discount window borrowings in the week to Wednesday were
935 mln dlrs a day, producing a daily average for the two-week
statement period of 689 mln dlrs, the highest since the week of
December 31, 1986, and up from 393 mln dlrs previously.
    Moreover, banks were forced to borrow a huge 5.2 billion
dlrs from the Fed on Wednesday - the highest daily total this
year - even though unexpectedly low Treasury balances at the
Fed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more in
reserves than the Fed had anticipated.
    However, economists said it is almost certain that the Fed
is aiming for much lower discount window borrowings than
witnessed this week. They pointed to two factors that may have
forced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week.
    First, economists now expect M-1 money supply for the week
ended April 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs,
partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of the
proceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions to
pay annual income taxes.
    As banks' checking-account liabilities rise, so do the
reserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the Fed.
    Required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 2.5 billion
dlrs a day in the two weeks ended Wednesday, but economists
said the Fed may not have believed in the magnitude of the
projected M-1 surge until late in the week and so started to
add reserves too late.
    Second, an apparent shortage of Treasury bills apparently
left Wall Street dealers with too little collateral with which
to enagage in repurchase agreements with the Fed, economists
said. Thus, although there were 10.3 billion dlrs of repos
outstanding on Wednesday night, the Fed may have wanted to add
even more reserves but was prevented from doing so.
    "It's not at all inconceivable that the Fed didn't add as
much as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral,"
said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc.
    McCarthy estimated that the Fed is now targetting
discount-window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day,
equivalent to a Fed funds rate of around 6-3/8 pct.
    After citing the reasons why the Fed probably has not
tightened credit to the degree suggested by the data,
economists said the fact that the Fed delayed arranging 
overnight injections of reserves until the last day of the
statement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy.
    Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank had not been convinced that
the Fed was tightening policy. But after reviewing today's
figures, he said, "It's fair to say that the Fed may be moving
toward a slightly less accommodative reserve posture."
    Leeds expects Fed funds to trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8
pct and said the Fed is unlikely to raise the discount rate
unless the dollar's fall gathers pace.
    Johnson at First Chicago agreed, citing political
opposition in Washington to a dollar-defense package at a time
when Congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key to
reducing the U.S. trade surplus with Japan.

<DATELINE>     SAN JOSE, April 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>A large group of "other milds"
coffee-growing nations will hold talks in Guatemala next month
to map their strategy for next September's meeting of the
International Coffee Organisation (ICO).
    Mario Fernandez, executive director of the Costa Rican
coffee institute, said delegates from Mexico, the Dominican
Republic, Peru, Ecuador, India, Papua New Guinea and five
central american nations will participate in the two-day
strategy session beginning May 4.
    The main topic will be reform of what many producing
countries perceive as the ICO's unfair distribution of export
quotas, Fernandez said.
    He said Costa Rica would press for quotas "based on the
real production and export potential of each country in the
past few years" and to distribute quotas based on "historic"
production levels rather than recent harvests and crop
estimates.

<TITLE>US STUDY DISCUSSES DROPPED COMSAT-CONTEL MERGER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>A congressional study today said the
proposed, but now apparently abandoned, merger of the
Communications Satellite Corp &lt;CQ> and Contel Corp &lt;CTC>
would technically be legal but could violate the spirt of the
law setting up COMSAT.
    Two weeks ago before the study was completed, Contel
announced it would seek to terminate the proposed merger.
    The study by the non partisan Congressional Research
Service (CRS) said "the proposed merger appears to comply,
technically, with the mandates or letter of statutes, if may
nevertheless violate the spirit of the law."
    Comsat, created by a 1962 act of Congress, and Contel, a
corporation of local telephone and communications firms, filed
with the Federal Communications Commission last November 3 an
application for merger. Several firms had protested the
proposed merger.
    In an analysis of the law, the research service issued
several critical comments about the structure of the new firm
and said apparent domination by Contel of a restructured COMSAT
would have broken the spirit of the law setting up
COMSAT.COMSAT is the U.S. arm of Intelstat, the international
satellite communications firm.

1.5 pct in March and 11.3 pct in the 12 months to March, the
Reserve Bank said.
    This compared with a revised rise of 0.5 pct in February
and 11.1 pct in the year to end-February.
    The Reserve Bank said the M-3 data for March was affected
by the start of the operations of &lt;National Mutual Royal
Savings Bank Ltd>, which has resulted in the transfer of
deposits (equivalent to around 1.5 pct of m-3) from the United
Permanent Building Society to National Mutual Royal Savings
Bank Ltd.
    The Reserve Bank said M-3 money supply in March was 110.77
billion Australian dlrs compared with a revised 109.11 billion
in February and 99.48 billion in March, 1986.
    M-3 is deposits of the private sector held by trading and
savings banks plus holdings of notes and coins.

<TITLE>JAPAN HAS NO PLANS FOR NEW MEASURES TO AID DLR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said
Japan has no plans to take new emergency measures to support
the dollar, other than foreign exchange intervention.
    He also told reporters that many major nations yesterday
intervened heavily to support the dollar against the yen.
    Yesterday's intervention was large in terms of the
countries involved and the amounts expended, he said.
    With the continued fall of the dollar against the yen,
0speculation had arisen in currency markets here that Japan
might take new measures to support the U.S. Currency, such as
curbing capital outflows.
    Miyazawa said that yesterday's news of a 4.3 pct rise in
U.S. Gnp in the first quarter had been expected. Although the
growth looks robust on the surface, the figures in reality are
not that good, he said.
    He said the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is
expected to come up with a final set of recommendations of ways
to stimulate the Japanese economy before Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone leaves for Washington next week.
    Commenting on yesterday's report on economic restructuring
by a high-level advisory panel to Nakasone, Miyazawa said it
was important to put the panel's recommendations into effect.

announcement issued after a meeting of its board of directors
that British Petroleum Co PLC &lt;BP.L> (BP) has extended its 70
dlr per share tender offer until midnight May 4.
    The offer for the 45 pct of Standard shares not owned by BP
had been due to expire midnight April 28.
    Standard Oil said discussions with BP concerning the tender
were continuing but provided no further details.
    "So long as those discussions continue, no recommendation
will be made to Standard Oil shareholders regarding the offer,"
Standard said.
    Standard directors met at the company's Cleveland
headquarters on Thursday in a regularly scheduled meeting. The
spokesman was unable to say if the meeting would continue on
Friday.
    A committee of independent directors previously obtained an
opinion from First Boston Corp that the Standard shares were
worth 85 dlrs each, 15 dlrs more than the BP offer.

leaves for Washington on April 29.
    Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita will be in Osaka,
western Japan on April 27 and 28 for the annual meeting of the
Asian Development Bank, making a rate cut announcement early
next week a virtual impossibility, they said. April 29 is a

<TITLE>ECUADOR TO USE COLOMBIA OIL LINK FOR FIVE YEARS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOGOTA, April 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ecuador will use a new pipeline link
with Colombia to export crude oil for the next five years,
Colombian mines and energy minister Guillermo Perry said.
    The link will be inaugurated on May 8. It was built to
allow Ecuador to resume exports of crude oil halted on March 5
by earthquake damage to its Lago Agrio to Balao pipeline,
    Once that pipeline is repaired, Ecuador will exceed its
OPEC quota in order to offset lost income and pay debts
contracted with Venezuela and Nigeria since the quake, Ecuador
mines and energy minister Javier Espinosa said.
    The two ministers were speaking at a news conference after
signing an agreement for joint oil exploration and exploitation
of the jungle border zone between the two nations. Drilling
will begin in September.
    "The agreement to transport Ecuadorean crude oil is not only
for this emergency period but for the next five years, with
possibility of an extension. Between 20,000 and 50,000 barrels
per day (bpd) will be pumped along it," Perry said.
    Espinosa said Ecuador planned to pump 35 mln barrels
through the link in the next five years, at a cost of 75 cents
per barrel during the first year.
    The 43-km link, with a maximum capacity of 50,000 bpd, will
run from Lago Agrio, the centre of of Ecuador's jungle
oilfields, to an existing Colombian pipeline that runs to the
Pacific port of Tumaco.
    Espinosa said the 32-km stretch of the link built on the
Ecuadorean side cost 10.5 mln dlrs. Perry gave no figures for
Colombia's 11 km segment but said it was "insignificant compared
with what we are going to earn."
    OPEC member Ecuador was pumping around 250,000 bpd before
the quake. Lost exports of 185,000 bpd are costing it 90 mln
dlrs per month, Espinosa said.

<DATELINE>    PEKING, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The south China province of Guangdong is
importing millions of tonnes of grain a year from overseas and
other parts of China because farmers have switched from grain
to more profitable crops, the Peking Review magazine said.
    The official magazine said the province's grain area fell
to 4.33 mln hectares in 1985 from 5.7 mln in 1978 out of a
total farmland area of 7.4 mln hectares.
    Farmers have switched to cash crops such as sugarcane,
bananas, oranges, papaya and freshwater fish-farming, in part
to supply major consumer markets in Hong Kong and Macao, the
magazine said. It gave no 1986 area figures.
    The magazine said China aims to keep 80 pct of national
farmland under grain, 10 pct under cash crops and 10 pct under
other crops, although the ratio will vary from place to place.
    It said primitive cultivation methods, labour-intensity and
low productivity make grain the least profitable farm
commodity. Farmers in one central region of China can from 0.1
hectare earn 2,250 yuan a year from vegetables, 375-450 yuan
from cotton or 225 yuan from grain, it added.
    It said consumer prices for foodgrain can be adjusted only
gradually as part of a reform of the entire pricing system.

<TITLE>SEOUL ANNOUNCES MORE TARIFF CUTS FOR U.S.</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SEOUL, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Korea will cut import taxes on 50
items, including construction equipment, photographic film,
cigarettes and pipe tobacco, to help reduce its trade surplus
with the United States, the finance ministry said.
    The tariff cuts, of between five and 30 percentage points,
take effect on July 1.
    This brings to 157 the number of goods on which import
taxes have been cut this year, a ministry official said.
    The 157 are among about 290 items on which Washington has
asked Seoul to lower tariffs, he added.
    Today's announcement follows Saturday's removal of import
curbs on 170 products. For 46 of those products, the U.S. Had
had sought free access to the South Korean market.
    "This is in line with the government's policy to limit our
trade surplus with the United States to help reduce trade
friction between the two countries," the official said.
    South Korea's trade surplus with the U.S. Rose to 7.3
billion dlrs in 1986 from 4.3 billion in 1985. Officials said
the surplus was expected to widen further in 1987 but Seoul
would try to hold it below eight billion dlrs.
    The finance ministry said tariffs would be cut later this
month on a further 53 items, including acrylic yarn and
ethylene, by an average 7.7 percentage points in order to check
inflation.
    The officials said the tariff cuts would contribute to
holding wholesale and consumer price rises at less than three
pct this year.

<TITLE>LATIN DEBTORS MAKE NEW PUSH FOR DEBT RELIEF</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Keith Grant, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    GUANAJUATO, Mexico, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Rising interest rates and
protectionist trade policies had prompted a new push by Latin
American nations to win debt relief, regional foreign and
finance ministry officials said here.
    Officials of the Cartagena group of 11 debtor nations met
here this week to draw up new proposals in reaction to what
they called a deteriorating world panorama, and Citicorp's
decision to create reserves against third world loans.
    (SEE ECRA FOR SPOTLIGHT HEADLINES)
    "We are looking at trade, interest rates and financial
flows.....In order to put forward a basis for some permanent
solutions," Mexico's public credit director Angel Gurria said.
    Recent developments have led to moves for a summit of Latin
American presidents and debate on new solutions.
    Ideas include schemes to link debt payments to trade, and
proposals for stable interest rates. The latter was proposed in
a letter this week from Cartagena to G-7 leaders who are due to
attend a summit in Venice this month.
    Another idea is to include debt under Gatt negotiations,
but Cartegena ministers have yet to endorse any proposals.
    Speaking earlier in New York, Uruguay's Foreign Minister
and Cartagena group chairman Enrique Iglesias said Citicorp's
decision could discourage new lending. But it might help
Cartagena's bid to have old and new debt treated separately.
    The Cartagena group, which has not met at ministerial level
for over a year, wants to repay debt contracted before the debt
crisis at the low interest rates prevailing in the 1970s. It
would pay new loans at current market rates.
    "Many countries fear that what they have gained in months of
arduous debt negotiations they can lose at a stroke with a one
point rise in interest rates," one official here said.
    "The new increase in interest rates has come precisely when
we thought they had still not come down enough," Iglesias said.
    Latin American officials are also concerned that varying
interest spreads granted to different debtor nations could
generate discord, as with the Philippines' recent protest at
being given less favourable terms than Argentina.
    There has been speculation Venezuela would demand a cut in
its 7/8 pct spread, but public finances director Jorge Marcano
said here there were no plans to renegotiate terms.
    This week's meeting came after three Latin American
presidents meeting in Montevideo called for stable interest
rates on the region's 380 billion dlr foreign debt. It was
called to review developments since the last ministerial
meeting in February 1986 and to think up new ideas.
    Since the last ministerial meeting there have been some
advances, such as Mexico's growth-oriented 77 billion dlr loan
and refinancing package agreed last September. But there have
also been setbacks, like Brazil's payments moratorium.
    The loans expected in the Baker plan have not materialized
and debtors have been forced to browbeat reluctant banks.
    "We have clearly stretched the restructuring process to its
limits and and the question is now where do we go from here?" a
senior Mexican foreign ministry official said.
    Existing debt strategy has been based on nursing debtor
economies back to a position where they can again service their
debts and qualify for new loans.
    But after five years of economic adjustment, Latin American
debtors are currently unable to raise voluntary credits, with
the exception of Colombia. Only Venezuela is paying back
principal. Most countries have no prospect of paying their
debts in the foreseeable future.
    Citicorp has made clear its decision to move three billion
dlrs to reserves does not mean it is writing-off the loans.
    Latin American officials here said Citicorp's move would
probably boost trading of discounted third world debt in the
secondary market, implicitly downvaluing the amount owed. But
they said it might make new lending even more remote.
    Discounted debt can be bought by foreign investors through
debt-equity schemes that generate new resources for debtor
economies. Chile and Mexico are currently front-runners in this
field, but most Latin American officials see these schemes as
limited and no panacea for the overall problem.
    Most Latin officials set greater store on building up
export income than on debt-equity schemes.
    Exports hit 97.7 billion dlrs in 1984, cutting the region's
debt service ratio to 36 pct, but they fell to 78.3 billion
last year. So, even though interest rates had dropped the ratio
hardly changed.
    The Cartagena group has called for the debt-trade link to
be recognized before, but has not made detailed proposals.
    Officials said initiatives discussed here would be
submitted to foreign and finance ministers of the 11 nations,
before IMF and World Bank annual meetings later this year.

<TITLE>U.S. STUDY SAYS TARIFFS AND QUOTAS COULD BACKFIRE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The use of tariffs and quotas to
reduce the flow of foreign goods into the United States will do
little to cut the nation's swelling trade deficit, a government
study said.
    In fact, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) report said,
such protectionist policies could make U.S. Products less
competitive in the world marketplace by raising the cost of
imported products that are re-exported in different forms.
    "Such policies are much more likely to hurt, rather than
help, the productive capabilities of the U.S. Economy," it said.
    The 218-page report, written by FTC economists John Hilke
and Philip Nelson, blamed the rising trade shortfall, which
climbed to a record 166.3 billion dlrs last year, on shifting
currency exchange rates and growing U.S consumer demand.
    Other factors commonly blamed for the deficit, such as
foreign trade practices, deteriorating U.S. Industrial
competitiveness, high labour costs and government restrictions
on mergers, added little to the problem, it said.
    "Although each industry's competitiveness affects the level
of imports and exports in that industry, in general we find
that there have been no significant industry-specific changes
affecting competitiveness that would explain the increase in
the overall trade deficit," the study said.
    "To the extent any government action is needed to deal with
the trade deficits, policies should focus on economy-wide
phenomena such as exchange rates and relative economic growth,"
the FTC study said.
    Supporting its conclusion that broad-based economic shifts
were the cause of the increase in the trade deficit, the report
said it found that nearly all U.S. Industries lost some
domestic market share to foreign competitors in the 1980s.
    It also said it found a "fairly direct relationship" between
the increased trade deficit and the influence of shifting
currency exchange rates, U.S. Economic growth and domestic
demand for goods and services, which has outpaced foreign
consumer demand.
    The study examined seven factors which have been commonly
blamed for the trade deficit: foreign government subsidies and
trade barriers to protect foreign industries, a lack of
investment in U.S. Industry, declining research and development
in U.S. Industry, high labour costs, union work rules, the oil
prices rises of the 1970s and U.S. Antitrust regulations.
    In each case, the study found little or no evidence that
the factor had any impact on the trade deficit.

<TITLE>RENISON GC AND CITY RESOURCES SET PNG GOLD VENTURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Renison Goldfields Consolidated Ltd
&lt;RGFJ.S> (RGC) and explorer &lt;City Resources Ltd> have agreed in
principle on a joint venture to re-examine the Bulolo alluvial
gold field in Papua New Guinea, City Resources said.
    City Resources would progressively earn up to 66.66 pct of
RGC's Prospecting Authority 585, which covers all the field, by
spending a total of 6.5 mln kina, it said in a statement.
    It said it believed Bulolo was not fully exploited in the
past, noting the literature refers to heavy gold losses in
tailings during dredging from 1931 to 1967 which produced a
total of 2.1 mln ounces.
    City Resources also said previous dredging was only carried
out to a depth of 36 metres and high grade gold values are
reported to at least 60 metres in the central part of the
Bulolo Valley and possibly as deep as 90 metres.
    In its productive life, recovered average grade at Bulolo
was 0.3 rpt 0.3 grams a tonne from some 207 mln cubic metres of
gravel, it said. City Resources will act as operator.
    The Bulolo field, in Morobe Province, was the first
successful gold mining operation of &lt;Placer Development Ltd>
after it was floated in Canada in 1926. It operated the field
until dredging ceased in 1967.

<TITLE>VENEZUELA HAS NO PLANS TO SEEK REVISED DEBT ACCORD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GUANAJUATO, Mexico, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Venezuela has no plans to try
to renegotiate the debt rescheduling agreement it worked out
with creditor banks in February, public finance director Jorge
Marcano told Reuters.
    Speaking here after a meeting of the 11-nation Cartagena
group, Marcano said he was aware of political pressure at home
to reduce debt payments but did not think such a move would
benefit Venezuela.
    "We have no intention of revising the terms of the accord,"
he said. "There would be little to gain and in fact it would
probably be detrimental."
    Venezuela agreed with its bank advisory committee on a 14.5
year rescheduling of 20.3 billion dlrs in public sector foreign
debt, with an interest rate 7/8 pct over Libor. The previous
agreement, reached a year before but never implemented, was for
12-1/2 years with a 1-1/8 pct spread.
    In Caracas there have recently been calls to invoke the
agreement's contingency clause which the government used last
year to amend the original terms after a 40 pct drop in oil
income.
    But Marcano said the bulk of payments to be made this year
are on private debts and non-rescheduled public debts.
    Marcano said Venezuela, which has reduced its debt by six
billion dlrs since 1983, should have no problems in repaying
restructured debt this year or next.
    Asked whether the government felt badly treated with its
7/8 pct spread when Mexico and Argentina have won a 13/16 pct
margin, Marcano said he still felt Venezuela had a good deal.
    "Venezuela has restructured its debt so that most of it is
being repaid at 7/8 pct, which I think is better than the other
countries," he said. The rescheduling accord covers some 90 pct
of Venezuela's commercial bank debt, which accounts for more
than 90 pct of the total public sector external debt.
    Venezuela has almost no debt outstanding to multilateral
agencies.
    Marcano said attempting to revise the rescheduling accord a
second time would probably hurt Venezuela's bid to restore it
credit rating and raise new loans.
    He said Venezuela now obtains trade credit lines without a
government guarantee, something that Argentina and others are
just starting to try to negotiate in their restructuring
packages.
    Venezuela is currently seeking loans in Japan and West
Germany to finance steel and aluminium expansion.
    According to finance minister Manuel Azpurua, a 100 mln
mark credit has been lined up for the Venalum aluminium plant.
    Marcano said no mandate has yet been given for a planned
100 mln dlr bond issue, although he confirmed that talks were
continuing with Morgan Guaranty and other banks.
    Banking sources said one option was to privately place the
bonds through the Caracas-based Banco de Venezuela, which would
underwrite the issue, but Marcano said no decision has yet been
made.

<DATELINE>    KUWAIT, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Kuwait Central Bank kept its window
for funds to the domestic interbank deposit market shut as
banks returned from a four day holiday, dealers said.
    The move drove short-term interest rates sharply higher,
with overnight and tomorrow-next funds more than doubling from
last Wednesday and hitting 20 pct.
    There were few offers in a tight market and traders
scrambled for any available funds. One-month to one-year
deposits were indicated one point higher at eight, seven pct
but there was little activity at the longer end of the market.
    Bankers see the suspension of central bank aid as a
deliberate move to drive up Kuwaiti dinar interest rates and
stem a flow of funds out of the country, where market
nervousness is increasing over the growing tension in the Gulf.
    The central bank's move has been combined with a steady cut
in the dinar exchange rate.
    Today's rate was reduced to 0.27939/73 to the dollar from
0.27758/92 on Wednesday before the four day bank holiday that
celebrated the end of the fasting month of Ramadan.

<TITLE>PHILIPPINE COCONUT CHIEF TO LOBBY AGAINST EC TAX</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Chaitanya Kalbag, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA)
chairman Jose Romero said he would visit Brussels later this
month to lobby against a proposed 100 pct European Community
(EC) levy on vegetable oil imports.
    "I intend to visit Brussels and talk to whoever is putting
up this devilish scheme to impoverish third world countries
like the Philippines," Romero said in an interview.
    He said he did not know how much support the levy had
within the EC but he said he believed those originally opposed
to the tax were under pressure to change their position.
    Romero said a group of EC members led by West Germany, the
Netherlands, Denmark and Norway were opposed to the tax. But
there was a danger some of them would be persuaded to change
sides, and if that happened opposition could crumble.
    Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warning
that copra meal cake used in livestock feeds contained
dangerous levels of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic chemical.
    He said the EC standard of 0.02 parts of aflatoxin per
million parts of meal, which EC countries had been asked to
apply by October 1988, was too rigid. He said Philippine copra
cake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin.
    Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when it
is not properly dried or ground.
    Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal in
London that the Philippines was doing its best to meet EC
standards. It was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally,
but this was likely to take several years of research.
    Copra meal exports were 817,641 tonnes or 35 pct of total
coconut exports in 1986. The meal was worth 73.5 mln dlrs.
    Romero said he would also visit Oxford University's
department of agricultural economics to discuss ways of
avoiding the copra process altogether.
    "There are ways of producing coconut products outside of
copra," Romero said. "We can process fresh coconut without drying
the meat in the sun. Through the wet process we can process
coconuts into other food or non-food products, or we can go to
the chemical root."
    He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries to
become more protectionist and he expected export prices of
coconut products to drop.
    "In the long term we will be getting less and less for more
and more production, and I'm not comfortable with that," he
said.
    With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping up
production of palm oil, a coconut oil substitute, palm oil
output had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971, Romero said.
    "To add to that the U.S. Soybean Association is spending
billions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil by
saying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart,"
he said.
    Romero said he expected coconut product export prices to
stay up for the rest of the year. They would probably touch a
high of 20 cents/pound from the current level of 18.59 cents,
and a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 10.50 cents.
    Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five-year
coconut production cycle which showed production tended to fall
after two successive years of good harvests.
    He said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year, to
add to the production fall, drought had affected output.
    "Traders are stocking up and when they have overbought the
prices will start declining again. The only sure way to keep
prices stable is by processing, adding more value," he said.
    Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop by
planting other cash crops between coconut trees, he said.
    "A typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on
10,000 square metres of land. That's a lot of space," Romero
said. He said the government's proposed land reform program
would exclude about 75 pct of the coconut farmers because they
had less than the proposed seven-hectares of land.
    "If the idea of land reform is to increase income levels,
production and employment then it won't happen," he said.
    PCA figures show about one-third of the country's
population is dependent on the coconut industry.
    Coconuts are planted on about 3.2 mln hectares or
one-fourth of total agricultural land.

<TITLE>PEMEX OFFICIAL SAYS OPEC OUTPUT CRITICAL TO PRICE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Crude oil prices could remain around 18
dlrs a barrel until the end of the year, but OPEC's decision on
output at its next meeting would be the critical factor, an
official of Mexico's state oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos
(Pemex), told a group of Japanese businessmen.
    Adrian Lajous, Pemex' executive vice president of
international trade, said current OPEC output already appeared
to be very near the 16.6 mln barrel per day level it set itself
for the third quarter. "Production is surging ahead of what was
originally planned, while demand is growing more slowly than
envisaged a few months ago," he said.
    He said OPEC had to look very carefully at what level of
production in the third quarter would effectively sustain the
18 dlrs price, and that an increase to what had originally been
envisaged might soften price levels.
    The 13-member cartel is scheduled to meet on June 25 in
Vienna to review its December accord on prices and output.
    "I hope OPEC will follow a very conservative attitude in
terms of volume decisions," Lajous said.
    A repetition of what happened last year, when OPEC boosted
output and sent oil prices tumbling down below 10 dlrs, is
always there as a possibility, he said.
    "I hope never again to go through the trauma of 1986. I
expect other oil exporters have learned their lessons and
discipline will be maintained," he said.
    Lajous said there was still excess supply and as long as
this remains there will be a tendency to instability in oil
markets, but prices should remain around 18 to 19 dlrs during
1987 if output remains under control.
    He said Saudi King Fahd's remarks last month, that
increased production was not so important as long as incomes
would not be affected by the output, were "very relevant and
welcome from such a powerful producer."

    Allegis said then that it would borrow three billion dlrs

the company's net worth. The Coniston group, which owns 13 pct
of Allegis stock, has said that it would seek shareholder
consents to remove 13 of the 16 Allegis directors. The group
had said it would consider breaking up Allegis into its
airline, hotel and vehicle rental components if it succeeded.
    The Coniston group said it expects to make a further

    Wall Street analysts and traders had not expected Coniston
to abandon its pursuit of Allegis as a result of the Allegis
defensive measures.

<TITLE>COMINCO LEAD/ZINC UNION REJECTS CONTRACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TRAIL, BRITISH COLUMBIA, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Three United Steelworkers
of America locals on strike at Cominco Ltd rejected a tentative
three-year contract, a union representative said.
    "The vote was 1,229, or 54.5 pct, against, and 1,028, or
45.5 pct, for the contract. Eighty-one pct of the membership
voted," he said.
    The union representative said that the pact offered cost of
living increases designed to keep pace with inflation, but
contained no wage increase.
    The locals' bargaining committees are expected to meet and
prepare for the reopening of negotiations with Cominco, he
said.
    The three locals cover about 2,600 production and
maintenance workers at Cominco's Trail smelter and Kimberley,
B.C. lead-zinc mine.
    Output at both sites has been shut down since the
production and maintenance workers, along with about 600 office
and technical workers, went on strike May 9.
    The two Steelworkers locals representing the office and
technical workers have not negotiated since May 21.
    The strike caused Cominco to declare force majeure, which
means the company may not be able to honor contracts for
products from the smelter and mine.
    Each of the five locals have separate contracts, all of
which expired April 30, but the main issues are similar.
    The union had requested a three pct wage increase in each
year of a two-year contract. Cominco had pressed for a
three-year contract and some loosening of the rules on job
classifications.
    The Trail smelter, about 400 miles east of Vancouver,
produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long tons of
lead last year. The Sullivan mine at Kimberley, about 450 miles
east of Vancouver, produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year,
most for processing at the Trail smelter.
    The smelter also produced cadmium, bismuth and indium.
    Revenues from the Trail smelter totalled 356 mln Canadian
dlrs in 1986.

<TITLE>COMINCO &lt;CLT.TO> UNION REJECTS CONTRACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     Trail, British Columbia, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Three United
Steelworkers of America locals on strike at Cominco Ltd
rejected a tentative three-year contract, a union
representative said.
     "The vote was 1,229, or 54.5 pct, against, and 1,028, or
45.5 pct, for the contract. Eighty-one pct of the membership
voted," he said.
     The union representative said that the pact offered cost
of living increases designed to keep pace with inflation, but
contained no wage increase.       
    The locals' bargaining committees are expected to meet and
prepare for the reopening of negotiations with Cominco, he
said.
     The three locals cover about 2,600 production and
maintenance workers at Cominco's Trail smelter and Kimberley,
B.C. lead-zinc mine.
     Output at both sites has been shut down since the
production and maintenance workers, along with about 600 office
and technical workers, went on strike May nine.     
     The two Steelworkers locals representing the office and
technical workers have not negotiated since May 21.
     The strike caused Cominco to declare force majeire, which
means the company may not be able to honor contracts for
products from the smelter and mine.
    Each of the five locals have separate contracts, all of
which expired April 30, but the main issues are similar.       

     The union had requested a three pct wage increase in each
year of a two-year contract. Cominco had pressed for a

<TITLE>DUTCH COCOA PROCESSORS UNHAPPY WITH ICCO BUFFER</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jeremy Lovell, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    ROTTERDAM, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dutch cocoa processors are unhappy with
the intermittent buying activities of the International Cocoa
Organization's buffer stock manager, industry sources told
Reuters.
    "The way he is operating at the moment is doing almost
nothing to support the market. In fact he could be said to be
actively depressing it," one company spokesman said.
    Including the 3,000 tonnes he acquired on Friday, the total
amount of cocoa bought by the buffer stock manager since he
recently began support operations totals 21,000 tonnes.
    Despite this buying, the price of cocoa is well under the
1,600 Special Drawing Rights, SDRs, a tonne level below which
the bsm is obliged to buy cocoa off the market.
    "Even before he started operations, traders estimated the
manager would need to buy at least up to his 75,000 tonnes
maximum before prices moved up to or above the 1,600 SDR level,
and yet he appears reluctant to do so," one manufacturer said.
    "We all hoped the manager would move into the market to buy
up to 75,000 tonnes in a fairly short period, and then simply
step back," he added.
    "The way the manager is only nibbling at the edge of the
market at the moment is actually depressing sentiment and the
market because everyone is holding back from both buying and
selling waiting to see what the manager will do next," one
processor said.
    "As long as his buying tactics remain the same the market is
likely to stay in the doldrums, and I see no indication he is
about to alter his methods," he added.
    Processors and chocolate manufacturers said consumer prices
for cocoa products were unlikely to be affected by buffer stock
buying for some time to come.

<TITLE>SPECTRA-PHYSICS &lt;SPY> BOARD REJECTS TENDER OFFER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAN JOSE, Calif., June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Spectra-Physics Inc said its
board rejected a 32 dlrs per share unsolicited tender offer for
the company's stock from Ciba-Geigy Ltd &lt;CIGZ.Z>, which already
holds 18.8 pct of the stock.
    Spectra-Physics said it also filed a lawsuit in Delaware
federal court this morning seeking to enjoin the offer and
alleging, among other things, that the offer vilates federal
securities laws, certain agreements between Ciba-Geigy and
Spectra-Physics, and Ciba-Geigy's fiduciary duties.
    Spectra-Physics said the two Ciba-Geigy designess to its
board were not present at yesterday's special meeting which
voted to reject the offer as financially inadequate, unfair and
not in the best interests of Spectra-Physics or its
stockholders.
    The company said the board also authorized a special
committee of outside directors to take whatever steps it deems
necessary to protect the interests of Spectra-Physics and its
stockholders and to investigate all alternatives to maximize
the value of the stock, including talks with third parties.
    Spectra-Physics said a letter communicating the board's
recommendation and reasons therefore is being mailed to
stockholders.
    It said Robert Bruce, Reliance Group Holdings Inc's &lt;REL>
designee on Spectra-Physics' board, resigned his position on
May 29. His letter of resignation said the action was to
alleviate Ciba-Geigy's stated justification for making the
unsolicited offer that it had not contemplated another
significant investor having representation on the board when
its Spectra-Physics' investment was made.

<TITLE>FRENCH SAY WHEAT STOCKS FORECAST NO SURPRISE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Department of Agriculture's
forecast that French end-of-season soft wheat stocks will
almost double in 1987/88 is premature but would not be
surprising, according to French cereal organisation officials.
    The Cereals Intervention Board, ONIC, Wheat Producers'
Association and the National Union of Agricultural and Cereal
Cooperatives have not yet forecast 1987/88 exports or
end-of-season stocks.
    However, the officials said the USDA's figure of end
1987/88 stocks at 5.03 mln tonnes against 1986/87's 2.87 mln
was not surprising given a record high yield forecast in April.
    The French Feed Cereals Research Institute, ITCF, forecast
in mid-April an average yield of 6.58 tonnes per hectare for
soft wheat in 1987/88 compared with 5.6 tonnes in 1986/87 and
the record high yield of 6.5/6.6 tonnes in 1984.
    This would result in a French soft wheat harvest of around
31 mln tonnes against 25.5 mln in 1986/87, given a Ministry of
Agriculture estimate of area planted of 4.66 mln hectares
against 4.61 mln in 1986/87.
    ONIC's first preliminary forecast of the 1987/88 campaign
will be released at the beginning of September, an ONIC
official said.
    Soft wheat exports in 1987/88 were extremely difficult to
estimate at this stage, both within the European Community and
to non-EC countries, an ONIC official said.
    He said, however, that among countries to which France
could increase its wheat exports were Egypt and the Maghreb
countries (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), he said.
    The USDA's forecast of an 11.65 mln tonne maize crop in
1987/88 against 11.48 mln in 1986/87, while again premature,
was not out of line with estimates of the French Maize
Producers Association, AGPM, an AGPM official said.
    Maize plantings would be down in 1987/88 but yields were
expected to be higher, the AGPM official said.
    It estimated 1987/88 maize plantings of 1.73 mln hectares,
down seven pct from the 1.87 mln hectares planted in 1986/87.

<TITLE>BOEING &lt;BA> TO ACQUIRE DEFENSE ELECTRONICS FIRM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SEATTLE, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Boeing Co and ARGOSystems Inc &lt;ARGI.O>
said they reached an agreement for Boeing to acquire the
Sunnyvale, Calif., defense electronics firm for about 275 mln
dlrs.
    The boards of both companies have approved the merger,
which will be accomplished through a tender offer by a Boeing
subsidiary of 37 dlrs a share cash for all of ARGOSystems'
shares, the companies said.
    Under the agreement, the Boeing subsidiary, TBC Holdings
Corp, will begin the tender offer promptly. If at least 90 pct
of the shares are not tendered, the offer will be prorated to
49 pct, the companies said.
    ARGOSystems has granted Boeing an option to buy 1,238,311
shares or 18.5 pct of the outstanding stock for 37 dlrs a
share, they said.
    Also, Bill May, chairman of ARGOSystems, and three other
officers have granted Boeing an option to buy their shares,
another 8.9 pct of the outstanding stock, for 37 dlrs a share.
    ARGOSystems makes equipment to monitor and analyze military
communications signals, electronic warfare equipment to monitor
and jam radar signals and signal processing systems.
    For the nine months ended March 31, 1987, ARGOSystems
reported earnings more than doubled to 6.3 mln dlrs or 95 cts a
share from 3.1 mln dlrs or 46 cts. The year-ago period included
a 2.2 mln dlr charge from a writedown of securities. Sales rose
23.5 pct to 70.9 mln dlrs.
    Sales are expected to exceed 100 mln dlrs for the fiscal
year ending June 30, the companies said in a joint statement.
    The company's backlog is currently more than 180 mln dlrs,
they said. It has about 1,200 employees.
    About 30 pct of ARGOSystems' business comes from
international customers.
    "ARGOSystems is a clear leader in its field. This
association will expand our overall activities and
significantly enhance our ability to compete in the defense
electronics area," Boeing president Frank Shrontz said in a
statement.
    ARGOSystems will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of
Boeing Co.
    The merger following the tender offer will be subject to
approval by ARGOSystems shareholders, the companies said.
    The tender offer and merger are subject to customary
conditions and expiration of the Hart-Scott-Rodino notification
waiting period, they said.

<TITLE>ZAMBIA CUTS PRICES AS TROOPS PATROL COPPERBELT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUSAKA, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Zambian government today announced
minor price cuts for essential commodities as part of its new
economic strategy, while police and troops patrolled the
northern Copperbelt to prevent any outbreaks of rioting.
    However, staple foods, such as bread, sugar and maize meal,
were not affected by the cuts and many people said this could
provoke trouble from disgruntled elements who had expected more
sweeping reductions.
    Observers in the capital expressed disillusionment with the
small extent of the price cuts, which ranged up to 10 pct on
items such as blankets, soap, detergents and baby food.
    Residents in the Copperbelt contacted by telephone said
government forces had set up roadblocks around the main towns.
    In Lusaka, business went on as usual and there was no sign
of troops or police reinforcements on the streets.
    President Kaunda had ordered the price reductions to take
account of lower import costs following the revaluation of the
kwacha to a fixed rate of eight per dlr from 21 on May 1.
    The revaluation formed part of a new go-it-alone economic
strategy which Kaunda adopted to replace Zambia's IMF austerity
program.
    Labour leaders in the Copperbelt said last week gangs of
unemployed youths were being formed in the politically volatile
region to take action against shops that did not reduce their
prices after today's deadline. Fifteen people were killed in
the Copperbelt during food riots last December after the
government tried to lift maize subsidies.

<TITLE>SEOUL ANNOUNCES MORE TARIFF CUTS FOR U.S.</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SEOUL, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Korea will cut import taxes on 50
goods, including construction equipment, cigarettes and
tobacco, to help reduce its trade surplus with the United
States, the Finance Ministry said today. The tariff cuts of
between five and 30 pct will take effect on July 1.
    South Korea ran a trade surplus of 7.3 billion dlrs with
Washington in 1986, sharply up from 4.3 billion in 1985.
    Today's announcement brings to 157 the number of goods for
which similar measures were taken this year, a ministry
official said. The 157 are among about 290 items on which
Washington has asked Seoul to lower tariffs.
    "This is in line with the government's policy to limit our
trade surplus with the United States to help reduce trade
friction between the two countries," said the official.

<TITLE>INDIA PLANS MORE BOMBAY OFFSHORE OIL WELLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOMBAY, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>India's state-owned Oil and Natural Gas
Commission (ONGC) plans to drill more wells in the Bombay
offshore area, where a well spudded in February this year gave
both oil and gas, an ONGC spokesman said.
    The exploratory well, spudded at a depth of 2,140 metres,
yielded 2,000 barrels of oil and 180,000 cubic metres of gas
per day, he said.
    "The well, one of the four structures drilled in the area 80
km north-west of Bombay, indicates good prospects of both oil
and gas. We've decided to drill at least three more wells in
there before starting production on a commercial scale."
    Production of Bombay High, part of the Bombay offshore
field, has stabilised at around 500,000 barrels per day for the
last two years.
    ONGC produced 27.85 mln tonnes of crude in 1986/87 ending
March, up from 27.51 the previous year. Bombay High accounted
for 20.61 mln tonnes, marginally up from 20.10 the year before.
India's total oil output is around 30 mln tonnes.
    ONGC has been exploring the Bombay offshore area, developed
since the late 1970s, for more oil as production from Bombay
High has reached a plateau.

<TITLE>SAUDI RENEGOTIATION OF ARAMCO DEAL MOVING ALONG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, JUNE 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Saudi Arabia's renegotiation of its
collective agreement with Aramco to purchase oil for the
latter's ex-partners is moving along and should lead to a
fundamental structural change in the contract, oil industry
sources said.
    Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, in this Monday's edition,
said negotiations are moving along for adjustment of the 1.34
mln bpd joint long term agreement at official prices and
volumes and other terms may be rearranged.
    The agreement signed in January for the months from
February to June is up for renegotiation.
    Under the January contract Aramco was to purchase 1.34 mln
bpd for the four partners allocated among them as Exxon Corp
&lt;XON> 440,000 bpd, Texaco Inc &lt;TX> 350,000 bpd, Mobil Corp
&lt;MOB> and Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> 550,000 bpd between them.
    But an overlifting by Texaco Inc in the first quarter
allowed other companies like Exxon Corp to underlift its
obligations under the contract
    PIW said that that one alternative under consideration is
to revert to four individual contracts rather than a collective
agrement.
    John Lichtblau, director of the Petroleum Industry Research
Foundation Inc said that renegotiation of the pact was more of
a formality as the Saudis have each company on a separate
schedule although separate agreements with the companies would
favor one on one negotiations and ensure that contracted
liftings occur .
    "The companies will probably follow the Saudi wants within
limits as they do not want to antagonize them for the long
haul," he said.
    Lichtblau said that the renegotiations would most likely
concentrate on volume rather than price.
    Saudi displeasure with the agreement has long been noted
and in April industry publications said that renegotiation were
being sought, a fact later confirmed by Reuters with Aramco.
    Aramco Corp was formerly owned by Chevron Corp &lt;CHV>, Exxon
Corp &lt;XON>, Mobil Corp &lt;MOB> and Texaco Inc &lt;TX> but is now
owned by Saudi Arabia which bought its assets although the
ex-partners have various agreements with Saudi Arabia.

<TITLE>OKLAHOMA CLEANING UP AFTER WEEK OF FLOODS, RAINS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OKLAHOMA CITY, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Residents of central Oklahoma
returned to their homes over the weekend after a week of heavy
rains and severe flooding that left two dead and caused more
than 20 mln dlrs in damage, officials said.
    Some 900 people were evacuated from their homes during the
rains and flooding last week, civil defense officials said.
    Many of the shelters set up throughout the state in areas
threatened by flooding, except those near the Washita and Red
Rivers, closed as residents returned to their damaged homes.
    Farmers who had expected a near-record wheat crop now say
this year will see one of the largest losses in decades.
    Gov. Henry Bellmon, who on Thursday declared a flooding
emergency for central Oklahoma, was expected to ask President
Reagan for federal disaster relief for the area.
    In northern Texas, officials reported several tornadoes on
Friday. A twister in Lubbock yesterday damaged six mobile homes
and two houses. No injuries were reported.

<TITLE>PAY N' PAK &lt;PNP> GETS TWO OFFERS FOR COMPANY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pay N' Pak Stores Inc said it received
two proposals in response to its previously announced
solicitation of potential buyers for the company.
    The company said it is evaluating the proposals from Paul
Bilzerian and from a third party which is active in the
leveraged buyout field but which Pay N' Pak declined to
identify.
    It said the Bilzerian proposal calls for shareholders to
receive on a blended basis 16.67 dlrs in cash and 3.30 dlrs in
liquidation value of cumulative exchangeable redeemable
preferred stock for each common share.
   
    Pay N' Pak said the second proposal is structured as a
merger in which each holder would receive a combination of
17.50 dlrs in cash and 2.50 dlrs in liquidation value of 13-1/2
pct cumulative preferred.
    The company said the dividend on the preferred offered by
Bilzerian would be set so that in the opinion his financial
advisor and the company's financial advisor the preferred would
trade in the public market at its liquidation value.
    Dividends on the preferred could be paid at the option of
the surviving corporation in cash or additional shares of
preferred for the first five years, it added..
   
    Pay N' Pak said Bilzerian's proposal is subject to a
physical inventory of merchandise at June 30. Bilzerian did not
provide details with respect to financing of his proposal,
which is not subject to a financing condition.
    The company said dividends on the preferred being offered
in the second proposal would be paid in additional preferred in
the first three years and the preferred would be redeemed in
years 12 and 13.
    It said the second offer is contingent on the arrangement
of financing, adding the party making the offer is confident of
its ability to obtain the balance of the financing.
   
    Pay N' Pak said the second proposal is conditioned upon a
satisfactory agreement with the company's management regarding
its equity participation in the new company.
    The second party anticipates executing a letter of intent
when it delivers its financing commitment to the Pay N' Pak
board that would incorporate an expense reinbursement and
option arrangement, the company said.

<TITLE>MAXWELL FILES SUIT TO STOP HARCOURT &lt;HBJ></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Publisher Robert Maxwell's British
Printing and Communicaton Corp PLC said it filed a lawsuit in
U.S. district court against Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc, its
directors and advisers to stop, among other things, payment of
the special dividend Harcourt is paying as part of its
recapitalization.
    The suit, filed in Manhattan, also names First Boston Corp
&lt;FBC> and seeks to void the issue by Harcourt of 40,000 shares
of super voting preferred stock to First Boston Securities Corp
and the issue of convertible voting preferred stock with
4,700,000 votes in the Harcourt employee stock ownership plan.
    The preferred shares to be issued to First Boston have
8,160,000 votes. The suit, brought derivatively on behalf of
Harcourt and individually in British Printing's capacity as a
substantial holder of Harcourt common shares and 6-3/8 pct
convertible debentures.
    The suit alleges Harcourt's special dividend exceeds by
more than one billion dlrs Harcout's surplus available for
dividends under New York law and contstitutes a fraudulent
conveyance.
    The lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt failed to disclose
that one consequence of the payment of the dividend, which it
terms illegal, will be that shareholders will be liable to
repay it.
    Harcourt last week said it would pay 40 dlrs per share to
stockholders as a special dividend. Harcourt also announced an
extensive recapitalization plan, which analysts said was aimed
at thwarting a takeover effort by British Printing.
    British Printing last week withdrew its 44 dlr per share,
or two billion dlr offer for Harcourt because of the
recapitalizaton plan. At the time, it said it was reviewing its
alternatives.
    British Printing said it filed the suit after consultation
with its advisers. Its lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt
failed to disclose the effect of the special dividend on
Harcourt 6-3/8 pct convertible debentures.
    British Printing alleges the effect will be an enormous
increase effective on the June eight record date for the
dividend in the number of Harcourt common shares issuable upon
conversion of the debentures. British Printing also charged 
Harcourt is unlawfully coercing debenture holders to convert
denbentures before the record date because Harcourt may not
have enough authorized common shares to honor conversion after
the date.
    British Printing holds 460,600 shares and 5.6 mln dlrs
worth of debentures.
    The suit also alleges that management, the board of
directors, and First Boston engaged in an illegal scheme of
entrenchment through a combination of selling to First Boston
Securities Corp the super voting preferred at a bargain price,
the grant to the company employee stock plan of convertible
voting preferred, the six mln share open market repurchase
program and the manner in which its financing has been
structured.

<TEXT TYPE="UNPROC">&#2;
OPEC OUTPUT IN MAY SEEN OVER CEILING AT 17 MLN BPD LONDON, June
1 - OPEC's May output appears to have risen well above its 15.8
mln bpd ceiling to 17 mln bpd, and the increase is likely to
put a short-term lid on spot oil prices, Kleinwort Grieveson
Securities says.
    But Kleinwort's latest World Oil Report said re-stocking
and lower non-OPEC output earlier this year should allow the
group to produce up to 17 mln bpd in the current third quarter.
    "On the supply/demand front, the market continues to enjoy a
degree of stability rarely seen in recent years," it said.
    It said most OPEC members were overproducing slightly but
only the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was seriously above quota.
    The report said Saudi Arabia had been sending clear signals
on the need to maintain oil prices at current levels of around
18 dlrs a barrel and adopt provisional output rises agreed in
December when OPEC meets in Vienna on June 25. If OPEC adopts
the provisional ceilings of 16.6 mln bpd in third quarter and
18.3 mln bpd in the fourth, there will probably be room for
overproduction in the third quarter when demand for its crude
will probably be 17.5 to 18 mln, it said.
    It said that the UAE and Ecuador may demand higher quotas
in Vienna, but the biggest obstacle is Iraq, which has refused
to honour its quota as it is less than that of Gulf War enemy
Iran.
    But OPEC appears committed to a short meeting and realises
something must be done about the Iraq issue, the report said.
    According to Kleinwort's sources, Saudi Arabia has already
held separate talks with Iran and Iraq and is urging Iraq to be
more moderate.
    "One strong indication that some kind of deal may be
eventually worked out is the almost complete silence coming
from Iran," it said.
    Indications are that, in return for going along with the
Saudi desire to maintain official prices in Vienna, Iran is
seeking concessions from the kingdom on the Iraq issue, it
said.
    Kleinwort said the kingdom will face an increasingly uphill
task in trying to maintain prices around 18 dlrs beyond 1987.
    Firstly, OPEC hardliners led by Iran are bound to oppose
such a move. Secondly, other OPEC members will press for
another price rise if the dollar remains weak against other
currencies.
    Thirdly, Saudi Arabia may be forced to raise prices earlier
than it intended to ward off growing calls for higher prices
from the U.S. To stimulate domestic drilling and exploration.
    The report concluded that there is a strong possibility
official OPEC prices will rise to 20 dlrs a barrel by end-1987
and 22 dlrs a barrel by end-1988.

sales totaling 230 mln dlrs.
    It said Prince, a Lowell, Mass., producer of pasta and
Italian food sauces, is expected to account for 210 mln dlrs of
this total. This year's sales of Borden pasta -- by the 13
regional brands and the premium Creamette brand distributed on
a nearly national basis -- are expected to toal 285 mln dlrs,
it said.
    Borden said the other three companies being acquired are
Steero Bouillon of Jersey City, N.J., Blue Channel Inc, a
Beaufort, S.C., producer of canned crabmeat, and the canned
shrimp products line of DeJean Packing Inc of Biloxi, Miss.
    Borden also said the divestment of three operations with
about 50 mln dlrs a year in sales is expected to produce nearly
45 mln dlrs in cash for use toward the purchase of new
businesses.
    It said the sale of Polyco of Cincinnati, Ohio, which makes
polyvinyl acetate emulsions, to Rohm and Haas Co &lt;ROH> was
announced by the buyer last month.
   
    Borden said the divestment of two producers of toy models
and hobby items -- Heller in France and Humbrol in England --
is in process.

<TITLE>U.K. BANKERS CONSIDER NEW ECGD FINANCING PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Representatives of major U.K. Based banks
are meeting here today to consider a new plan for reducing the
cost of financing British exports guaranteed by the Export
Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD), senior banking sources
said.
    The plan is being developed in conjunction with the ECGD
and the Bank of England.
    Neither the ECGD nor the Bank of England would comment on
the plan. However, bankers said one of the main points under
discussion is a plan to refinance the bulk of the ECGD's medium
term credit portfolio in the international capital markets.

    The proposals involve introducing a set of interest margins
on ECGD backed debt of 5/16 to 7/8 pct, depending on the size
and maturity of the credit and the currency.
    The banks are likely to push for a higher margin. Bankers
said that while these rates would reduce a bank's return they
would still be more than those proposed about a year ago when
the government attempted unsuccessfully to initiate another
cost reduction plan.
    At the same time, the banks would be expected to allow the
ECGD to realise additional savings by refinancing existing
government backed credit in the capital markets.

    On credits that are refinanced an original lender would
receive a residual margin of 7/16 pct for loans up to 10 mln
stg and 3/16 pct on larger transactions.

<TITLE>GEODYNE &lt;GEOD.O> SETS WARRANTS, ACQUISITION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TULSA, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Geodyne Resources Inc said iit filed a
registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission
covering a planned offering of 3.6 mln warrants to buy its
common.
    The company also said its board is evaluating a proposal to
acquire closely-held &lt;Snyder Exploration Co> for one mln
Geodyne shares. Members of Geodyne's senior management also
serve as senior management at Snyder and PaineWebber Group Inc
&lt;PWJ>, which owns 40 pct of Geodyne's 12.6 mln outstanding
shares, has a substantial equity interest in Snyder.
    The acquisition is being evaluated by Geodyne board members
not employed by the company, PaineWebber or any company
affiliated with PaineWebber. It will be subject to approval by
the board and series C preferred shareholders.
    Geodyne Resources said a registration related to the stock
to be exchanged for Snyder has been filed with the SEC but has
not yet become effective.
    The Snyder owners other than PainWebber are Geodyne's
president, Michael W. Tomasso, and its executive vice
president, James D. Snyder.
    The company said the warrants will be offered solely to
investors in the PaineWebber/Geodyne Energy Income Program II.
For every 100 dlrs invested in the program, an investor will be
entitled to buy one warrant to purchase one Geodyne common
share at a price equal to 120 pct of the average closing price
of the stock for the 15 trading days prior to formation of the
partnership to which the investor subscribes.
    In adddition, Geodyne said, PaineWebber investment
executives who market the program will be entitled to receive
one warrant for every 500 dlrs in subcriptions generated after
a four-year vesting period. These warrants would have an
exercise price equal to 150 pct of the 15-day average.
    The company said the warrants are currently priced at 25
cts each, but this price is suject to further evaluation by an
independent underwriter.

<TITLE>COMPROMISE SEEN LIKELY OVER CONOCO-STATOIL DISPUTE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OSLO, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Norway is expected to seek a compromise
solution to defuse a row between Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap
A/S &lt;STAT.OL> (Statoil) and Conoco Norge A/S over which firm
will operate the Heidrun oil field, government sources said.
    The sources, who asked not to be named, said the government
will likely recommend that Conoco be allowed to continue as the
field's operator through the development phase, with Statoil
taking over only after production starts in the early 1990s.
    Oil Minister Arne Oeien told Reuters the government had
today discused the Heidrun matter but that no final decision
had been taken and several questions remained unresolved.
    It was unlikely the government would announce its decision
on Heidrun operatorship until after Thursday's cabinet meeting
and after discussing a proposed solution with both companies,
the sources added.
    This spring Norway's state-owned oil company Statoil
exercised an option in the Heidrun field exploration license
that, if approved by the government, would allow it to relieve
Conoco as Heidrun operator, a move sharply criticised by
Conoco.
    Heidrun is often cited by the government and industry as
the most likely candidate for the first field development
project on the Haltenbanken exploration tract off central
Norway.

<TITLE>DUTCH OFFICIAL RATE CUT SEEN STILL LIKELY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Marcel Michelson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    AMSTERDAM, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>A cut of about half a percentage point
in Dutch official interest rates is still in prospect, although
economists said the timing would depend on Bundesbank moves.
    Speculation has been rife that the Dutch Central Bank,
encouraged by a strong guilder/mark relationship and wide
premiums for Dutch money and capital market rates over German,
might lower rates without the Bundesbank moving first.
    Last month, the Central Bank lowered its special advances
rate to 5.1 pct from 5.25 pct after the Bundesbank dropped its
repurchase tender rate to 3.55 pct from 3.8 pct.
    That rate has remained in force, just holding above the
five pct official secured loans rate which governs commercial
bank borrowings.
    Given a strong guilder, a further fall in the West German
repo rate would trigger a lower special advances tariff,
forcing an official Dutch rate cut, analysts said.
    In February, when the Bundesbank cut its discount rate to
three pct from 3.5 pct, the Central Bank only lowered money
market rates and removed a surcharge over the secured loans
rate on lending under its three month credit quota.
    Since then, however, both the Central Bank and Finance
Ministry have made it clear they favour lower official rates.
    In April, Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said he
would follow any Bundesbank cut, and last week the Finance
Ministry expressed satisfaction when it raised 2.25 billion
guilders with a six pct coupon state loan priced at 100.10 pct
for an effective yield of 5.98 pct, the lowest since 1965.
    Technically, analysts said, there has to be a difference
between the secured loans rate which applies to lending under
the credit quota, and the tariff on special advances which add
extra liquidity to the money market.
    Bank economists and dealers said a West German move to
further lower the rate on securities repurchase pacts would
result in the Central Bank easing the special advance rate,
provided the guilder/mark relationship permitted.
    The Central Bank aims to keep the guilder stable around its
parity value within the European Monetary System of 112.673
guilders per 100 marks.
    Today, foreign exchange buying pushed the mark up 10
guilder cents to 112.705 guilders per 100 at the fix, a level
that would not permit a change in the interest rate
differential between West Germany and the Netherlands, dealers
said.
    An economist at ABN Bank said he expected West German and
Dutch interest rates to ease in the short term. However, he
said new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflation
expectations which would put upward pressure on interest rates
in the longer term.
    In the Netherlands, the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil,
or even negative, while the latest official economic forecasts
point to a falling rate of economic growth.
    "It will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreement
negotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation,"
the ABN economist said.
    He said Dutch money supply growth, which ran at 3.4 pct in
January, could also contribute to some inflation.
    At Amro Bank, a leading analyst said inflation could run to
two pct next year. The bank expects Dutch capital market rates,
currently averaging around 6.1 pct, to stop easing in the
second half of this year and stabilize around 5.6 pct.
    Analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buying
spree on the bond market which would bring yields down,
probably only temporarily, while money rates could fall below
five pct.
    Currently, all periods are traded at 5.12 to 5.25 pct in
the money market.

<DATELINE>    TORONTO, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Northgate Exploration Ltd said
hourly-paid workers at its two Chibougamau, Quebec, mines voted
on the weekend to accept a three-year contract offer and
returned to work today after a one-month strike.
    It said the workers, represented by United Steelworkers of
America, would receive a 1.21-dlr-an-hour pay raise over the
life of the new contract and improved benefits.
    Northgate, which produced 23,400 ounces of gold in first
quarter, said that while the strike slowed production, "We are
still looking forward to a very satisfactory performance." The
Chibougamau mines produced 81,500 ounces of gold last year.

<TITLE>LITTLE REACTION TO COMEX PRICE LIMIT REMOVAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The elimination of price limits on
precious metals contracts trading at the Commodity Exchange in
New York appears to be having little effect on the market,
analysts said.
    "There is nothing apparent from the change," said William
O'Neill, director of futures research at Elders Futures Inc.
"The market has not approached the old price limits and trading
is relative quiet, in narrow ranges," he added.
    Gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs on
market moves in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weaker
in the nearby contracts amid thin conditions, traders said.
    On May 5, COMEX did away with price limits on the two
contracts following spot after a volatile market in silver
futures at the end of April caused severe disruptions.
    During the last week of April, silver futures traded up and
down the price limit in the back months, causing traders to
rush into the spot contract to offset those moves, analysts
said.  As a result, Elders' O'Neill said, there was much
confusion, many unmatched trades, and large losses.
    The COMEX fined Elders Futures and three other large firms
a total of 100,000 dlrs for failure to resolve unmatched trades
in a timely manner.
    Silver futures were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in the
nearby contracts amid quiet trading today.
    O'Neill said the elimination of price limits on all COMEX
metals futures would add caution to trading since all contracts
could move any distance.
    "This is amore realistic approach because the metals market
is a 24 hours market and prices can move without limit,"
O'Neill said.
    Paul Cain, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers,
said the elimination of price limits will cut back on panic
buying or selling  and contribute to more orderly markets.

<TITLE>U.S. TRADE BILL VERY DANGEROUS FOR CANADA, LOBBY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, June 1 -  </DATELINE><BODY>A trade bill before the United States
House of Representatives "is a very dangerous bill for Canadian
industry," Canadian Forest Industry Council chairman Adam
Zimmerman told reporters.
    By changing the definition of subsidy under U.S.
countervailing duty law, House of Representatives Bill 3
removes protection for companies that take advantage of widely
used government programs, Zimmerman told a media briefing.
    "Clearly, any industry to which Canadian governments grant
rights to fish, mine, cut timber, or produce power could be
vulnerable to a finding of a subsidy under this language," he
said.
    The Canadian forest lobby's Zimmerman also said the House
of Representative Bill would adopt a new way of measuring
subsidies that would greatly increase the size of any
countervailing duties that might be imposed on Canadian
resource exports to the U.S.
    Under the bill, any difference between Canadian prices and
U.S. or world market prices would constitute a subsidy, he
said. Such a method would make Canadian resource industries
vulnerable to similar penalties like a 15 pct export tax
imposed last January on shipments of Canadian softwood lumber
to the U.S., Zimmerman added.
    Canadian negotiators agreed to levy the new tax if a U.S.
forest industry lobby would drop its request for a countervail
duty on imports of Canadian softwood lumber.
    "We represent the first victim of the move to price other
countries' natural resources according to the U.S. system,"
Zimmerman said.
    "If we're an example, than other resource industries had
better watch out," he added.
    Zimmerman said the Canadian Forest Industry Council plans
to discuss concerns about the U.S. trade bill with lobby groups
from other Canadian resource industries.

<TITLE>EC MINISTERS CONSIDER CUTBACKS IN STEEL SUPPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUXEMBOURG, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>A new steel quota system that would
strictly limit European Community (EC) support to the industry
could be forced on producers if they fail to find their own
solution quickly, officials said.
    EC industry ministers meeting here considered two key
proposals aimed at cutting back surplus capacity by 30 mln
tonnes by 1990.
    The first would limit the current quota system, which has
protected EC output for seven years, only to flat products and
heavy sections, thereby forcing other types of steel products
into free market competition.
    The second proposal would link continuation of a quota
system with progress toward plant closures, although less than
a month ago the EC steelmakers' lobby group Eurofer said they
had abandoned efforts to close plants voluntarily.
    The ministers stopped short of imposing their own solution
immediately, instead urging steel producers to try again to
reach agreement on voluntary cutbacks.
    The EC Commission has said it will come up with detailed
proposals in July on the future of the EC steel industry and EC
industry ministers meet again in September to reach a final
decision.

<TITLE>CANADA LUMBER EXPORTS MAY BECOME UNPROFITABLE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canada's softwood lumber will become
unprofitable for some forest product producers if prices
decline to about 175 U.S. dlrs per thousand board feet of two
by four inch lumber from current levels of about 195 U.S. dlrs,
Canadian Forest Industry Council chairman Adam Zimmerman told
reporters.
    Zimmerman reiterated profitability has been hurt by a move
by Canadian negotiators to impose last January a 15 pct export
tax on softwood lumber shipped to the U.S. in exchange for a
U.S. lumbermen's lobby dropping its request for a countervail
duty.
    "I think that there has been a falling off in the market, so
I think there is a moderate slow down in the price now,"
Zimmerman said at a media briefing.
    Zimmerman said the adverse impact from lower U.S. lumber
product prices would be felt by lumber mills in eastern Canada
first, migrating westward.
    "The country has swallowed a time bomb and it will go off
when times get tough," Zimmerman said.
    He also said the federal government should maintain the
existing 15 pct export tax and not allow provinces to offset
the tax with increased provincial fees for cutting lumber.

<TITLE>COMPUTER ASSOC. &lt;CA> BOLSTERS HAND AGAINST IBM</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    BY LAWRENCE EDELMAN, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Computer Associates International Inc's
800 mln dlr merger with Uccel Corp &lt;UCE> will eliminate its
strongest rival, but the company still faces stiff competition
from International Business Machines Corp &lt;IBM>, Wall Street
analysts said.
     "IBM is still the ruling force in mainframe systems
software," said Scott Smith, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin
and Jenrette.
    "But the combination of the two companies will clearly
present a much stronger front," he said.
    Besides IBM, "Computer Associates will be far and away the
most powerful company in the field," added E.F. Hutton analyst
Terence Quinn.
    That field is a segment of the market known as system
utilities, or software packages that boost the productivity of
a company's data processing facilities by increasing the speed,
power and efficiency of large mainframe computers.
    The merger of Uccel and Computer Associates combines the
two biggest systems utilities suppliers other than IBM.
Analysts said the remaining players are mostly small firms that
will find the competition much harder than in the past.
    For Computer Associates, the merger with Uccel caps a
six-year acquisition campaign that has vaulted the Garden City,
N.Y.-based company to the top of the software industry.
    When the deal is completed sometime in August, the
company's revenues will exceed 450 mln dlrs, pushing it past 
Microsoft Corp &lt;MFST> as the world's largest independent
software vendor.
    Computer Associates founder and chairman Charles B. Wang
took the company public in 1981, and since then he has bought
15 companies and boosted annual sales from 18.5 mln to 309.3
mln dlrs for the year ended March 31.
    Liemandt took charge of Wyly, sold off its non-computer
businesses and decided that it would focus solely on mainframe
computer software. In 1984, the company was renamed Uccel Corp.
    Liemandt, who said he will leave the company after the
merger is completed, also turned to acquisitions for growth.
    On the last day of 1986, Uccel completed the buyouts of six
companies for a total of about 60 mln dlrs.
    For 1986, it earned 17.0 mln dlrs, or 1.01 dlrs a share, on
sales of 141.5 mln dlrs.
    The agreement took industry analysts by surprise, largely
because the companies had been such bitter rivals. Also,
Dallas-based Uccel had engineered a strong comeback from the
dark days of 1982, when, as Wyly Corp, it lost 7.7 mln dlrs, or
56 cts a share.
   At that time, Wyly owned a potpourri of 13 different
businesses, only three of which were involved in computer
software. In 1983, Walter Haefner, a Swiss financier and a
major Wyly investor, lured Gregory J. Liemandt away from his
job as chairman of General Electric Co's &lt;GE> computer services
unit.
    Computer Associates' Wang and Uccel's Liemandt said at a
news conference that the merger would give computer users a
single source for a wide range of software products.
    In addition to system utilities, Computer Associates also
sell products for microcomputers, while Uccel has made inroads
in the applications software market, where analysts said it has
been successful with accounting and banking systems.
    Wang said Computer Associates would continue to support and
enhance both companies' product lines, but noted that the
company will eventually weed out duplicate offerings. He said
about 20 pct of the companies' products overlap.
    Analysts said the merger would dilute the holdings of
current Computer Associates shareholders by about 10 pct. But
they joined Wang in forecasting that the deal will not dilute
Computer Associates' earnings for the current fiscal year.
    Quinn of E.F. Hutton said Wang has a proven track record of
completing acquisitions without earnings dilution. Therefore,
he said he would not change his 1988 earnings estimate of 1.05
dlrs a share.
    Wang said he would look closely at the combined operations
of the two companies and cut duplication in sales, marketing
and research and development.
    Analysts said Computer Associates paid a premium for Uccel.
Based on Friday's closing price, the company will swap 47.50
dlrs worth of its stock for each Uccel share, which is nearly
33 times Uccel's 1987 estimated earnings of 1.45 dlrs a share.
    Stephen T. McClellan of Merrill Lynch Research said most
software companies are currently valued at about 20 times
per-share earnings. But the analyst said Uccel was worth the
premium because of its earnings potential and customer base.

    Wang said Haefner, the Swiss investor, would hold about 25
pct of Computer Associates stock after the merger. He currently
owns 58 pct of Uccel.
    The executive said the merger would not alter his target of
maintaining sales and earnings growth of 30 pct to 35 pct.
    In addition, he said he expects no problems in having the
deal cleared by the antitrust division of the U.S. Justice
Department.
    Uccel's Liemandt declined to say what he will do after the
merger, but he did not rule out working together with Wang.

<TITLE>MAXWELL WOULD NOT RENEW BID IF SUIT FAILS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    London, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>British press magnate Robert Maxwell said
his British Printing and Communication Corp Plc would not renew
its bid for Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc &lt;HBJ> if the lawsuit
filed against Harcourt in New York today fails.
    Speaking at a press conference, Maxwell denied market
rumors that British Printing had approached British
institutions to arrange a rights issue with a view to
relaunching its bid for the U.S. publishing concern.
    "I don't believe in chasing mirages," maxwell said.
    British Printing filed suit in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan to block what Maxwell called a fraudulent
recapitalization announced by Harcourt last week.
    Harcourt, in response to a hostile two billion dlr takeover
proposal from Maxwell, planned a recapitalization that would
pay shareholders 40 dlrs per share. Under the plan, it also
said 40 pct of its shares will be controlled by its employees,
management, and its financial adviser, First Boston Corp &lt;FBC>.

<TITLE>COCOA ORIGINS DISMAYED BY BUFFER STOCK ACTION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Read, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Traders recently returned from West Africa
say some producers there are dismayed by the ineffective action
so far by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) buffer
stock manager on buffer stock purchases.
    One trader said some West African producers are annoyed the
Buffer Stock manager is not playing his part as required by the
International Cocoa Pact to stabilise prices from current lows.
    So far, only 21,000 tonnes of second hand cocoa have been
taken up for buffer stock purposes and this, traders noted,
only on an intermittent basis.
    They noted the purchases, of 8,000 tonnes in the first week
he bought and 13,000 in the second, are well short of the
limitations of no more than 5,000 tonnes in one day and 20,000
in one week which the cocoa agreement places on him.
    The traders recently returned from West Africa say
producers there are unhappy about the impact on cocoa prices so
far, noting producing countries are part of the international
cocoa pact and deserve the same treatment as consumers.
    London traders say terminal market prices would have to
gain around 300 stg a tonne to take the ICCO 10-day average
indicator to its 1,935 sdr per tonne midway point (or reference
price).
    However, little progress has been made in that direction,
and the 10-day average is still well below the 1,600 sdr lower
intervention level at 1,562.87 from 1,569.46 previously.
    The buffer stock manager may announce today he will be
making purchases tomorrow, although under the rules of the
agreement such action is not automatic, traders said.
    Complaints about the inaction of the buffer stock manager
are not confined to West African producers, they observed.
    A Reuter report from Rotterdam quoted industry sources
there saying Dutch cocoa processors also are unhappy with the
intermittent buffer stock buying activities.
    In London, traders expressed surprise that no more than
21,000 tonnes cocoa has been bought so far against total
potential purchases under the new agreement of 150,000 tonnes.
Carryover holdings from the previous International Cocoa
Agreement in the stock total 100,000 tonnes.
    Terminal prices today rose by up to 10 stg a tonne from
Friday's close, basis July at its high of 1,271.
    It seems that when the buffer stock manager is absent from
the market, prices go up, while when he declares his intention
to buy, quite often the reverse applies, traders said.

<TITLE>LITTLE REACTION TO REMOVAL COMEX DAILY LIMITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The elimination of limits on daily price
fluctuations for metals futures contracts traded on the
Commodity Exchange, COMEX, appears to be having little effect
on the market, analysts said.
    "There is nothing apparent from the change," said William
O'Neill, director of futures research at Elders Futures Inc.
    "The market has not approached the old price limits and
trading is relative quiet, in narrow ranges," he said.
    On May 5, COMEX eliminated price limits on the two
contracts following each spot delivery in gold, silver, copper
and aluminum futures after a review of its clearing operations,
which were severely tested by a volatile market in silver
futures at the end of April. COMEX announced Friday the lifting
of all daily limits, effective today.
    Gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs per
ounce in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weaker in the
nearby contracts amid thin volume conditions, traders said.
    Silver futures, previously limited at 50 cents in most back
months, were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in the nearby
contracts amid quiet trading today.
    During the last week of April, silver futures often traded
at the daily allowable limit amid concerns about inflation, the
dollar, and other factors. Traders rushed into the spot, or
unlimited, contract to offset those moves, analysts said.
    As a result, O'Neill said, there was much confusion, many
unmatched trades, and large losses for some traders.
    The COMEX fined four large firms a total of 100,000 dlrs
for failure to resolve unmatched trades in a timely manner.
    Paul Cain, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers,
said the elimination of price limits will cut back on panic
buying or selling and contribute to more orderly markets.
    O'Neill added that the elimination of daily limits would
add caution to trading.
    "This is a more realistic approach because the metals
market is a 24 hours market and prices can move without limit,"
O'Neill said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>TIN TRADERS' RESPONSE MUTED TO KL FUTURES MARKET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>European free market tin traders made a
somewhat muted response to plans for a Kuala Lumpur
dollar-based tin futures market due to be launched in October.
    Traders said the new market would probably be a useful
trading medium for Japan and other South East Asian tin
interests although European traders generally appear to be
reasonably satisfied with the current "free market" system
which has been operating since London Metal Exchange, LME, tin
trading ceased in October 1985. Dealers here will also want to
see how acceptable foreign metal will be on the new market and
what sort of demand develops for forward deliveries.
    There is also a view among European traders that, while the
proposed Kuala Lumpur tin futures market would provide another
useful reference point, a market inaugurated by the Malaysian
government -- in the past viewed as a major player at times by
the trade -- would make participants uncomfortable.
    Some traders expressed a preference for a resumption of
trading on the London Metal Exchange, but they added that while
there has been some behind the scenes discussion on the subject
a definite move is unlikely until outstanding High Court
litigation actions have been resolved.
    Spot tin prices on the European free market are currently
around 4,200 stg per tonne for high grade metal in warehouse
Rotterdam. Over the past 18 months the price moved to a ten
year low of 3,400 stg in March 1986 and rebounded to as high as
4,680 stg in December 1986.
    This compares with 8,140 stg last paid when LME trading
ceased in October 1985 and a record high tin price of 10,350
stg traded for Cash Standard Grade metal in June of that year.
    LME warehouse stocks are now near a two-year low at 28,065
tonnes, having fallen steadily from a record high of 72,485
tonnes reached in February 1986.
    Traders said the free market turned bullish during late
last year based on producer forecasts of a supply/demand
deficit of some 28,000/29,000 tonnes. Analysts were predicting
prices of up to 5,000 stg per tonne during 1987.
    However, the trend was reversed following a strong upswing
in sterling versus the dollar and values fell back briefly to
4,100 stg last month after approaching 4,700 stg in December.
    The decline accelerated as producers who had sold very
little metal at the higher levels became competitive sellers.
    There was also a lack of significant demand from major
steel mills who made large purchases prior to the new year.
    Traders say the 15 ITC creditor banks' original tin
holdings of nearly 45,000 tonnes have now been almost halved,
and the bulk of material still available is being held by
Malaysian and Japanese firms which are reluctant to depress the
market with unwanted metal.
    Some 80,000 tonnes were held by banks and brokers after the
International Tin Council's, ITC, buffer stock manager halted
support operations on the LME on behalf of the 22 members
nations of the International Tin Agreement.
    The overhang of metal was reduced further by broker
Shearson Lehman Brothers, which earlier this year reported
having sold its ITC-related holdings and halved its overall tin
position.
    Analysts see no immediate sign of a rally in European tin
prices and movements are still expected to be largely related
to currency fluctuations, unless significant consumer demand
emerges for the third quarter.
    The Association of Tin Producing Countries, ATPC, has made
efforts since the collapse of the ITA to achieve higher world
prices by attempting to bring all major producers under an
export control umbrella, but to date Brazil and China, two
major producers, remain unaffected by the ATPC argument and
apparently are continuing to offer material at discounts to
consumers in main European trading centres, dealers said.

<TITLE>REAGAN HINTS U.S. WANTS HELP IN PATROLLING GULF</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan said he would discuss
the Mideast Gulf situation with allied leaders at next week's
Venice economic summit and hinted he would seek their help in
preserving free navigation.
    In a speech prepared for delivery as the United States made
plans to protect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers from Iranian attack,
Reagan said the American people were aware that "it is not our
interests alone that are being protected."
    Saying that allied dependence on gulf oil was no secret,
Reagan declared, "During the upcoming summit in Venice, we will
be discussing the common security interests shared by the
western democracies in the MIDEAST Gulf.
    "The future belongs to the brave. Free men should not cower
before such challenges, and they should not expect to stand
alone."
    Reagan will meet the leaders of Britain, France, West
Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan at the economic summit, which
will take place in Venice June 8-10.
   
    The 13th annual top-level meeting of the major industrial
democracies will take place against a backdrop of rising
congressional concern over Reagan's plan to protect gulf
shipping and demands that the allies do more.
     These concerns were heightened by the May 17 Iraqi missile
attack on the U.S. frigate Stark which killed 37 seamen.
    "They died while guarding a chokepoint of freedom, deterring
aggression and reaffirming America's willingness to protect its
vital interests," Reagan said.
   
    In a pre-summit speech celebrating the 40th anniversary of
the Marshall Plan, Reagan, who spoke to an audience of foreign
affairs experts, also pledged to push for economic expansion by
West Germany and Japan to bolster the world trading system.
    "While the vibrancy of the U.S. economy has contributed
enormously to the world expansion, preserving a growing world
economy is the business of every member of the world trading
community," he said.
   
    "It will be made clear, especially to our friends in Japan
and the Federal Republic of Germany, that growth-oriented
domestic policies are needed to bolster the world trading
system on which they depend."
    Reagan coupled this appeal with a call for compliance with
allied accords on exchange rate stability.
    "Economic policy decisions made last year in Tokyo and at
this year's meetings of Group of Seven finance ministers in
Paris and in Washington cannot be ignored or forgotten," he
said. "The commitments made at these meetings need to be
translated into action."

Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen said his proposal for
a tax of up to 330 European Currency Units per tonne on oils
and fats was likely to go up for discussion at next week's
summit meeting of EC leaders.
    EC farm ministers have been unable to agree the tax, one of
the main items proposed by Andriessen for the 1987-88 farm
price package.
    The tax, which would apply on both domestically-produced
and imported oils and fats, has been fiercely opposed by the
United States and developing countries' vegetable and marine
oil producers.

<TITLE>BILZERIAN PREPARED TO TENDER FOR PAY N'PAK &lt;PNP></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Investor Paul Bilzerian said if Pay N'
Pak Stores Inc enters into a merger accord with him he will
immediately begin a tender offer for 7.5 mln shares for 20 dlrs
per share in cash.
    Bilzerian told Reuters he believes his offer is superior to
a leveraged buyout proposal disclosed in an announcement by the
company this morning.
    The company said it is evaluating both proposals.
Bilizerian said he was optimistic his offer will be accepted at
a meeting of the board of directors Wednesday. Officials of Pay
N' Pak did were not immediately available for comment.
 
    Bilzerian said he has a pool of 150 mln dlrs raised by
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc available for the tender and "we
may add a bank to that."
    "We've submitted an agreement we're prepared to sign," he
said. Shares not accepted in Bilzerian's tender would be
exchangeable for 20 dlrs in convertible preferred stock.
    Asked what would happen if the leveraged buyout group,
which the company did not identify, topped his offer between
now and the board meeting, Bilzerian said he expected an
opportunity to respond.
    Pay N' Pak gave no details about the buyout group, but did
say the offer was contingent on financing and on an agrreement
regarding management's equity participation.
    Bilzerian said it was his understanding that the management
particpation was "nominal."
    Pay N' Pak fell 1-1/2 to 19. Arbitrageurs said there was
disappointment that neither of the offers topped 20 dlrs.
    "We were expecting an offer north of (above) 21 or 22
dlrs," said one arbitrageur. The leveraged buyout plan was for
17.50 dlrs per share in cash and 2.50 dlrs in 13-1/2 pct
cumulative preferred stock.

    Robert Cheadle, analyst at Montgomery Securities, said "you
have to ask yourself why no one in the industry made a bid."
    Scott Drysdale, analyst at Birr Wilson Securities, said the
company has not made the best strategic moves over the years.
"They have not done the right things at the right time," he
said, and as a result earnings per share have steadily declined
since 1984. The 57 cts per share in earnings reported for the
fiscal year ended in February was lower than 1978's earnings,
he said. Earnings totaled 5.7 mln dlrs on revenue of 398.4 mln
dlrs.
    Drysdale said Pay N' Pak has better trained sales people
than many competitors, but it competes on price even though
competitors have lower costs. The result is squeezed margins.
He noted that there have been no other publicly identified
bidders stepping forward since the company rejected an earlier
Bilzerian proposal in mid-April.
    Another arbitrageur said it might not be too late for
another bidder to get in the game. He speculated that someone
in the same home improvement business might be able to offer a
deal for stock that would top both the buyout proposal and
Bilzerian's plan.

<TITLE>MAJOR U.S. OIL PIPELINE SHUT DOWN BY FLOODS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Flooding in the Red River on the
Texas/Oklahoma border has shut down the Basin Pipeline, a
24-inch pipeline that transports as much as 300,000 barrels per
day of sweet and sour crudes from Texas to Cushing, Okla, a
Texaco Pipeline Co spokesman confirmed.
    "The water is rushing by so fast that we can't get any
divers down to assess the damage but there is some possibility
that the pipeline could be up by the end of the week," a company
source said.
    The pipeline transmits roughly two-thirds sour crude and
one-third sweet crude oil from the Midland, Texas region.
    Texaco sources said that if the pipeline service is
restored by Friday there would be little problem in restoring
oil which has been lost to the flood.
    "But if the pipeline is down more than 10 days it will be
difficult to make up without prorationing and we would not like
to proration this pipeline, if we don't have to."
    The Basin Pipeline is jointly owned by Atlantic Richfield
Corp &lt;ARC>, Shell Oil Co, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell
Group &lt;RD> and Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, which is the pipeline's
operator.
     Peter Beutel, analyst at Elders Futures Inc, said crude
oil futures contracts on New York Mercantile Exchange rose to
new highs this afternoon following news of the pipeline break.
    July crude futures of West Texas Intermediate traded up to
19.60 dlrs a barrel, a rise of more than 20 cts.
    Cash market prices also firmed on the news with sellers of
WTI raising offers to 19.60 dlrs a barrel.
    Sour crudes, which would be most affected by the pipeline
shutdown, however, were slow to react to the news with West
Texas Sour and Alaska North Slope holding 50 cts to one dlr a
barrel below WTI, respectively.
    Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at
Texaco, said the company hopes to fix the pipeline in five days
but that will depend on when the water level of the Red River
recedes. There is already evidence that the water level is
dropping and it appears the rain has stopped in the area
affecting the pipeline, Stevens said.
    He said the segment of the pipeline that was damaged was
underground and at a distance from the Red River that flooded.
The pipeline runs over the Red River and under the subsoil
nearby, according to Stevens. He said some of this subsoil was
apparently washed away.
   
    The potential for environmental damage is being downplayed
at this time despite the volume of oil that runs through this
line.
    Texaco's Stevens said that aerial surveillance has not
found any crude on the water in the river or in Lake Texoma,
which is nearby.

<TITLE>TAKEOVER SPECULATION LIFTS HUTTON &lt;EFH> SHARES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>E.F. Hutton Group Inc shares rose on
speculation the company would receive a takeover offer, traders
said.
    Hutton's stock also was affected by a newspaper report that
First Boston Corp &lt;FBC> accumulated almost five pct of Hutton's
stock on behalf of an outside client, traders said. Traders
said the story, which appeared in USA Today, added speculation
which began on the street last week. They said there were
rumors the stock was under accumulation and speculation
abounded the company would soon receive an offer. A Hutton
official declined comment. Hutton's stock rose 2-1/4 to 39-3/8.
    Hutton several months ago rejected a buyout offer from
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc &lt;SHE>. The newspaper story
mentioned speculation American Express Co &lt;AXP>, the parent of
Shearson, was a possible buyer. But traders said the rumors
today did not name buyers. First Boston officials were not
immediatley available for comment.
    Prudential Bache analyst Larry Eckenfelder said he doubted
the speculation about American Express. He said he believed
Hutton, which is occassionally surrounded by rumors, moved up
today as a result of the newspaper article. "Hutton is still a
takeover candidate," said Eckenfelder.

<TITLE>CONGRESSMAN SAYS U.S. UNPREPARED FOR OIL CUTOFF</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Rep. Mike Synar said today that while
President Reagan is ready to use military force to protect
Kuwait tankers in the Gulf, the United States is ill-prepared
at home to deal with a new energy crisis.
    Synar, Democrat of Oklahoma, made his remarks in comments
on a study by the General Accounting Office (GAO) on the U.S.
participation in the 1985 test of the emergency oil sharing
program of the International Energy Agency.
    The IEA, an alliance of 21 oil consuming countries, was
formed after the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo to find ways to deal
with any future oil cutoff.
    Synar said, "the president is prepared to take military
action to protect Kuwaiti oil tankers but has been unwilling to
take less dangerous, equally-important action to prepare our
nation for the next energy crisis."
    Reagan said the U.S. military would protect Kuwaiti oilers
to assure the West of a continuing supply of Middle East oil,
increasingly being threatened by the Iranian-Iraqi war. Synar,
who asked for the GAO report after criticism of U.S. action in
a previous IEA test, said the United States successfully
advocated a test limited to training participants in oil
sharing procedures and the system's mechanical aspects.

<TITLE>COMINCO &lt;CLT.TO> SEES MEETING WITH STRIKING UNION LOCALS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TRAIL, British Columbia, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cominco Ltd said it
expects to meet today with two of five United Steelworkers of
America locals on strike at its Trail smelter and Kimberley,
B.C. lead-zinc mine, a Cominco spokesman said.
    It had no meeting scheduled with the other three striking
locals, which rejected a tentative three-year contract
Saturday, Cominco spokesman Richard Fish said.
    Fish said the pact that was rejected contained a cost of
living increase tied to the Canadian consumer price index, but
no wage increase. With 81 pct of the membership voting, 54.5
pct voted no and 45.5 pct voted yes, the union said.
    The three locals represent about 2,600 production and
maintenance workers, while the remaining two locals cover about
600 office and technical workers.
    The office and technical workers last negotiated May 21.
Production at Trail and Kimberley has been shut down since the
strike began May 9 and Cominco has had to declare force
majeure, which means the company may be unable to honor
contracts for products from the smelter and mine.
    Each of the five locals have separate contracts, all of
which expired April 30, but the main issues are similar.
    The Trail smelter, about 400 miles east of Vancouver,
produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long tons of
lead last year. The Sullivan mine at Kimberley, about 450 miles
east of Vancouver, produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year,
most for processing at the Trail smelter.
    The smelter also produced cadmium, bismuth and indium.
    Trail smelter revenue was 356 mln Canadian dlrs in 1986.

<TITLE>COMINCO SEEKS MEETING WITH STRIKING UNION LOCALS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TRAIL, British Columbia, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cominco Ltd said it
expects to meet today with two of five United Steelworkers of
America locals on strike at its Trail smelter and Kimberley,
B.C. lead-zinc mine, a Cominco spokesman said.
    It had no meeting scheduled with the other three striking
locals, which rejected a tentative three-year contract
Saturday, Cominco spokesman Richard Fish said.
    Fish said the pact that was rejected contained a cost of
living increase tied to the Canadian consumer price index, but
no wage increase. With 81 pct of the membership voting, 54.5
pct voted no and 45.5 pct voted yes, the union said.
    The three locals represent about 2,600 production and
maintenance workers, while the remaining two locals cover about
600 office and technical workers.
    The office and technical workers last negotiated May 21.
Production at Trail and Kimberley has been shut down since the
strike began May 9 and Cominco has had to declare force
majeure, which means the company may be unable to honor
contracts for products from the smelter and mine.
    Each of the five locals have separate contracts, all of
which expired April 30, but the main issues are similar.
    The Trail smelter, about 400 miles east of Vancouver,
produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long tons of
lead last year. The Sullivan mine at Kimberley, about 450 miles
east of Vancouver, produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year,
most for processing at the Trail smelter.
    The smelter also produced cadmium, bismuth and indium.
    Trail smelter revenue was 356 mln Canadian dlrs in 1986.

<TITLE>USPCI &lt;UPC> SEEN REJECTING UNION PACIFIC BID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, June 1 - USPCI Inc likely will reject a 43-dlr-a-</DATELINE><BODY>share bid made last Wednesday by Union Pacific Corp (UNP), 
analysts said.
    "The offer is inadequate," said Douglas Augenthaler, an
analyst with E.F. Hutton, noting that it does not represent the
needed premium over the company's fundamental value based on
earnings estimates.
    USPCI, which has 8.7 mln shares outstanding, was trading at
48-1/8, down 3/8.
    USPCI vice president of finance Larry Shelton said he could
not comment on the adequacy of the offer or on when the board
would meet to consider it.
    Augenthaler said that while USPCI was trading at only 34
dlrs a share at the time of the takeover bid, its announcement
that same day of higher earnings expectations changed its
value. USPCI said its second quarter earnings would exceed
analysts expectations of 24 to 30 cts a share.
    At that price, USPCI could maintain a stock price in the
low 40s, Augenthaler said.
    Hutton revised its 1987 earnings estimate for the waste
management concern to 1.40 dlrs a share from 1.20 dlrs on the
announcment, he said. It lifted its 1988 projection to 1.90
dlrs a share from 1.70 dlrs.
    In addition, analysts said the hazardous waste management
business holds significant growth potential. The industry has
grown from 16 to 35 pct over the last five years, based on
earnings per share, said Jeffrey Klein, an analyst with Kidder
Peabody and Co. The industry is expected to continue growing at
15 to 35 pct over the next five years, he said.
    Augenthaler said the 43-dlr-a-share offer, or 375 mln dlrs
total, would be a bargain for Union Pacific. The transportation
and energy company would both gain entry into a profitable
business and win cost-control benefits, he said.
    "Union Pacific has what are rumored to be some fairly
signficant environmmental problems of its own," he said.
    Herb Mee Jr., president of Beard Oil Co (BEC), which holds
a 30.4 pct stake in USPCI, said last week Union Pacific's offer
was "grossly inadequate."

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Total Petroleum NA &lt;TPN> shut down
several small crude oil pipelines operating near the
Texas/Oklahoma border last Friday as a precaution against
damage from local flooding, according to Gary Zollinger,
manager of operations.
    Total shut a 12-inch line that runs across the Ouachita
River from Wynnewood to Ardmore with a capacity of 62,000 bpd
as well as several smaller pipelines a few inches wide with
capacities of several thousand bpd or less, Zollinger said.
    The Basin Pipeline, a major pipeline running 300,000 bpd,
run by a consortium of other oil companies, was closed today.
    One other small pipeline that Total also closed has a
capacity of 3,000 to 4,000 bpd and crosses the Red River in
Fargo, Texas, Zollinger said.
    He said the closed pipelines run under river water and
could be damaged as the flooded rivers erode the river banks
and expose the piping.
    Zollinger said Total is waiting for the river waters to
recede before they reactivate the pipelines.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Energy Department said it reached
proposed oil pricing settlements totaling 680,150 dlrs with the
operator and four working interest owners of A.D. LeBlanc No. 1
well, Vermillion Parish, La.
    Trigon Exploration Co., Inc operated the well from June
1979 to January 1981 for D. Bryan Ferguson, C. William Rogers,
Omni Drilling Partnership No 1978-2 and Entex Inc.
    DOE alleged Trigon caused overcharges of 624,208 dlrs by
improperly classifying its oil as "newly discovered crude," a
classification that allowed charging higher prices during a
period of price controls.
    It said the proposed settlements would resolve disputes
over possible violations by the five parties. DOE added that in
agreeing to the settlements, the five did not admit any
violations or non-compliance with its regulations.
    It said it would receive written comments on the
settlements before making it final.

<TITLE>NPPC APPEAL ON CANADIAN PORK DISMISSED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Chicago, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Court of International Trade has
upheld the International Trade Commission's refusal to extend
countervailing duties on Canadian hogs to include pork
products, the National Pork Producers' Council said.
    The court's ruling came in an appeal to the Trade
Commission's decision filed by the Pork Producers' Council.
    Council president Tom Miller said he was disappointed by
the court ruling and said the council will accelerate
activities in support of an amendment to the 1930 Tariff Act
that would address the objections outlined in the Trade
Commission's ruling.
    The Commission had said there was insufficient economic
integration between the pork production industry and the pork
packing industry to justify extending the duty on live hogs to
fresh, chilled or frozen pork.
    The legislation has already passed the House of
Representatives and recently passed the Senate Finance
Committee. It is expected to be considered by the full Senate
by the end of the summer.
    An appeal by the Canadian Pork Council that the current
countervailing duty on Canadian hogs entering the U.S. be
lifted is pending before the Court.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>New York investor Asher Edelman and
Dominion Textile Inc &lt;DTX.T>, who are currently seeking to
acquire Burlington Industries Inc in a hostile tender offer,
said they lowered their stake in the company.
    In a filing with the Secruties and Exchange Commission, the
Edelman/Dominion group, known as Samjens Acqusition Corp, said
it sold options to buy 258,800 Burlington common shares,
reducing its stake in the company to 3,408,813 shares, or 12.33
pct, from 3,667,313 shares, or 13.3 pct.
    The group said the sale, which represented all the
Burlington options it owned, was made May 28 for 8.7 mln dlrs.
    The Edelman/Dominion group last week sweetened its hostile
tender offer to 77 dlrs a share, after Burlington agreed to a
leveraged buyout by a Morgan Stanley and Co-backed group for 76
dlrs a share.
    But the Edelman/Dominion group, which has litigation
pending against Burlington, also said it has held talks with
Morgan Stanley about "the possibility of settlement of
outstanding matters among" it, Morgan Stanley and Burlington.

<TITLE>ENTERTAINMENT MARKETING TOPS CRAZY EDDIE OFFER</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Michael Connor, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>A quickly growing Texas-based
distributor of electronics products offered 240 mln dlrs
for Crazy Eddie Inc &lt;crzy>, the leading New York City
electronics retailer, or one dlr per share more than its
founder has bid.
    The 8-dlr-a-share offer by Entertainment Marketing Inc &lt;em>
for Crazy Eddie comes less than two weeks after founder Eddie
Antar and a firm controlled by the Belzbergs of Canada
announced a bid to take the 32-store Crazy Eddie chain private.
    Analysts said Entertainment Marketing, whose revenues and
profits quadrupled in 1986, may be looking to break into the
highly competitive New York City retail market for consumer
electronics, the nation's biggest, at a time the fortunes of
electronics retailers have sagged.
    The analysts questioned whether Houston-based Entertainment
Marketing, founded by a former electronics retailer but whose
present buinesses are primarily as wholesale distributors, had
the management expertise for retailing or was merely trying to
drive up the price of the Crazy Eddie shares it already owns.
    "I have mixed feelings," said analyst Dennis Telzrow of
Eppler, Geurin and Turner, a Dallas brokerage. "On the one hand
it's probably a cheap price. On the other hand, does
Entertainment Marketing have the management talent to run it
and will the Crazy Eddie people leave?"
    "It's a risky strategy for Entertainment Marketing," said
analyst Eliot Laurence of Wessels Arnold and Henderson, a
Minneapolis brokerage. "Electronics retailing is very management
concentrated; they'd want to keep Crazy Eddie's management in
place."
    Laurence said that, since Entertainment Marketing already
owns 4.3 percent of Crazy Eddie's 31.3 million shares, it may
be trying to get the Antar-Belzberg group to increase its
7-dlr-a-share offer.
    Shares of Crazy Eddie, which have jumped from the high
4-dlr range to above 7 dlrs since the Antar-Belzberg bid was
announced May 20, rose another 50 cents Monday to 8.375 a share
in over-the- counter trading. 
    Antar, the reclusive founder of the chain in the New York
City, Philadelphia and Connecticut areas, said last month that
his group controlled 14 percent of Crazy Eddie's shares.
    A Crazy Eddie spokesman said the company's board has taken
no decision on the Antar-Belzberg offer, worth some 187 mln dlrs
since they own more shares than Entertainment Marketing. He
would not comment on the new offer.
    Entertainment Marketing sells computer products such as
disk drives and other, often discounted electronics goods to
retailers, primarily in the southwest, and directly to
consumers by cable television.
    In fiscal 1986, ending last January, its revenues rose to
87.9 mln dlrs from 21.3 mln dlrs the previous year. Net profit
went to 3.2 mln dlrs from 750,000 dlrs in 1985.
    Entertainment Marketing, whose chief executive officer,
Elias Zinn, once ran an electronics retailing business, said in
a statement it had committed 50 mln dlrs toward the purchase
of Crazy Eddie and had retained Dean Witter Reynolds Inc to
assist in financing the balance.
    Analyst Telzerow estimated that the company would have to
borrow about 100 mln dlrs to complete the proposed buyout since
Crazy Eddie has cash and other assets worth about the same
amount.
    Shares of Entertainment Marketing were up 12.5 cents Monday
to 9.50.

<TITLE>INVESTORS MAY TAKE COMPUTERLAND PUBLIC</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    BY LAWRENCE EDELMAN, REUTERS</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The investor group that has agreed to
buy &lt;Computerland Corp> will likely take the leading personal
computer retailer public or sell it to other investors,
industry analysts said.
    "Now's a good time," said Joe Levy of International Data
Corp. "The personal computer industry has bottomed out and is
on the way up again," he said.
    Earlier today, closely held Computerland, the largest PC
retailing chain in the country, said it agreed to be bought by
an investor group led by E.M. Warburg Pincus and Co, New York.
    Neither Computerland, which is 96 pct owned by its founder,
William H. Millard, nor E.M. Warburg, a money management and
venture capital firm, would disclose the value of the
transaction.
    Analysts estimated that Computerland, whose 800 stores
generated 1.4 billion dlrs in sales last year, would fetch  150
mln dlrs to 250 mln dlrs. Computerland franchise owners pay
royalties averaging 5.9 pct to the parent company.
    Officials for E.M. Warburg referred all questions to
Computerland. Computerland officials could not immediately be
reached for comment.
    E.M. Warburg currently manages 1.5 billion dlrs in venture
capital funds, and its past investments have included Mattel
Inc &lt;MAT> and the Ingersoll newspaper chain. It is also a money
manager, with 3.5 billion dlrs under management.
   Although the PC retailers are benefitting from the strong
upturn in PC sales, analysts said Computerland must make key
changes if it is to fend off advances from rivals like
Businessland Inc &lt;BUSL.O> and Tandy Corp's &lt;TAN> Radio Shack
stores. "The name of the game now is outbound sales forces,
customer service and customer support," said Levy of
International Data.

    Relations between Computerland and its franchise owners
have mellowed recently after Millard was forced to give up
managment control of the company in 1985.
    Ed Faber, who took over as chairman and chief executive
officer, revamped the company's royalty plan, which help quell
much of the franchisee dissent.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>BURLINGTON &lt;BUR> HEARING TO CONTINUE TOMORROW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Greensboro, N.C., June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. District Court Judge Eugene
A. Gordon said he plans to issue a decision tomorrow on
Burlington Industries Inc's request for an injunction to stop
Samjens Acquisition Corp's takeover bid for the company.
    Wall Street sources have said the outcome of the case could
be pivotal in determining the winner in the fierce takeover
battle for Burlington, the largest u.s. textile maker.
    Gordon presided over six hours of argument today by lawyers
for Burlington and Samjens, a partnership formed by Dominion
Textile Inc and New York investor Asher Edelman.
    Hearings are scheduled to continue tomorrow. A preliminary
injunction would hold up Samjens 2.47 billion dlr offer until
the case is decided.
    Burlington had previously agreed to a 2.44 billion dlr
buyout from Morgan Stanley Group Inc &lt;MS>, one dlr per share
lower than a sweetened 77 dlr per share bid made by Samjens
last week. Burlington has not responded to the new Samjens
offer.
    Burlington has alleged in its lawsuit that Edelman and
Dominion used illegally obtained confidential information about
the company in making their takeover attempt.
 
    That information, Burlington said, was provided by James
Ammeen, a former Burlington executive, through PaineWebber
Group Inc &lt;PWJ>. Ammeen, who had worked for Burlington for 23
years, had as many as 12 divisions with 50 pct of Burlington's
sales reporting to him. When he left Burlington in November,
1985, Burlington said he signed a contract promising never to
divulge inside information about the company.
    Burlington lawyers said shortly after he left he began
working with a PaineWebber employee on a hostile plan to
"takeover the company, dismember the company and displace its
management," Burlington lawyer Hubert Humphrey said.
    Samjens lawyers acknowledged it received information from
PaineWebber, but argued the information was public information
and could be obtained either from texitle industry analysts or
Burlington's public financial statements.
    Burlington lawyers said PaineWebber and Ammeen met with
Edelman and Dominion in November and continued to meet with
them until a couple of days before Edelman and Dominion went
public April 24 with their intention to take over the company.
Burlington lawyers claim Dominion's board decided to attempt a
takeover of Burlington after Ammeen met with the board in
February.
    Burlington lawyers said Edelman and Dominion held
discussions with PaineWebber and Ammeen about acting as
financial advisers to Samjens. But they allege talks broke off
because Painewebber and Ammeen could not satisfy Edelman and
dominion with a written statement that they did not provide
inside information.
    Lawyers for Samjens contended that Painewebber and Ammeen
withdrew as potential advisers because Burlington chairman
Frank Greenberg had called a PaineWebber executive and
threatened legal action if PaineWebber got involved in an
effort to takeover Burlilgnton.
    "The ultimate question is not the price per share or the
profit, but rather the permissable standards of conduct for
those who would takeover an American company," said burlington
lawyer Humphrey.
    Burlington lawyers also contended that Burlington, as the
largest manufacturer of denim in the United States, would be in
violation of anti-trust laws if it acquired Dominion, Canada's
largest textile maker. Dominion has denim manufacturing plants
in Georgia, which would reduce competition in the denim market,
the lawyers said.
    Samjens' lawyers discounted the concern. They said the
market for denim is more fragmented than Burlington contends
and that Burlington has the ability to switch between light
weight and heavy weight denim production as demand and price
dictate.
    Samjens lawyers also pointed to a lawsuit filed by
Burlington in Canada, in which it said it was considering a bid
for Dominion. "Surely, what would have been sauce for the goose
would have been sauce for the gander," said Sidney Rosdeitcher,
a Samjens lawyer.

<TITLE>VENEZUELA GETS 300 MLN DLRS CREDIT FOR ALUMINUM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CARACAS, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Venezuela has obtained more than 300 mln
dlrs in financing for industrial projects and increased its
lines of credit for import financing, finance minister Manuel
Azpurua said.
    'We can say that we are achieving the recuperation of
credit, but that cannot be done overnight,' Azpurua said in a
television interview.
    He said a credit agreement for 100 mln marks will be signed
this week with the German state bank Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau (KFW), to finance an expansion of the state
aluminum company Venalum.
    The credit will be divided into two separate agreements,
one for 85 mln marks with an interest rate of 6.13 pct, and
another for 15 mln marks, at 6.20 pct.
    Azpurua said financing has also been obtained for expansion
of Alcasa, another state aluminum company, and for projects in
the state steel and petrochemical industries.
    Yesterday, he said Venezuela obtained two new credits of
5.0 mln dlrs each for export financing, one from Credit du Nord
of France and the other from Britain's Midland Bank.
    The Venezuelan government has been criticised at home for
failing to obtain new credits, despite its insistence on
repaying foreign debt according to the terms of a rescheduling
accord reached last February.
    Azpurua recently visited Tokyo hoping to acquire new
credits for industrial expansions but clinched no agreements.
Japanese officials refused to allow a new issue of Venezuelan
bonds until the country regains its 'Triple A' credit rating.

<TITLE>U.S. TRADE DATA SEEN AS KEY TO DOLLAR TREND</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    BY HISANOBU OHSE, REUTERS</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The dollar's recent signs of stability
have raised hopes that its 27-month decline may be nearly over,
but most currency analysts refuse to commit themselves until
after the June 12 release of U.S. trade data for April.
    "The trade data will be a deciding factor to see if the
dollar has bottomed out," said Jim McGroarty of Discount Corp.
    Since February 1985, the dollar has nearly halved its value
against the yen and the mark as part of an officially
orchestrated campaign to make U.S. goods more competitive on
world markets and redress gaping world trade imbalances.
    On April 27, the dollar fell to a 40-year low of 137.25 yen
but has enjoyed a modest recovery over the last few weeks,
topping 145 yen today for the first time in nearly two months.
    Many economists now believe that the dollar has fallen far
enough to ease the trade deficit's drag on the U.S. economy.
    The U.S. trade gap narrowed to 13.6 billion dlrs in March
from 15.1 billion in February and is expected to show continued
improvement in April in volume, if not in real, terms.
    Keiichi Udagawa of Bank of Tokyo in New York said that if
further progress is reported, the dollar would head back up
towards 150 yen.
    "There is growing consensus that the dollar has bottomed
out for the medium term," added Tom Campbell of First National
Bank of Chicago.
    Other factors supporting this bullish view were growing
expectations that Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker would
be reappointed for a third four-year term in August, Japan's
larger-than-expected economic stimulus package last week and 
more favorably technical chart signals, analysts said.
    The dollar was also aided by Japan's moves to dampen
speculative selling in Tokyo and by reports of active central
bank intervention to support the dollar.
    The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said last week that
the U.S. monetary authorities bought more than four billion
dlrs during the February-April period -- the largest amount
since the dollar crisis of the late 1970's.
    Discount Corp's McGroarty described the Fed's intervention
volume as "impressive".
    James O'Neill of Marine Midland Bank was not so positive,
however: "the dollar has not yet bottomed out. After the trade
data are released, the dollar could fall towards 1.77 marks and
140 yen."
    Similarly, Natsuo Okada of Sumitomo Bank in New York
warned, "I don't think the dollar has bottomed out yet."
    Although the dollar could rise as high as 146.50 yen, Okada
said market impatience about the painstakingly slow decline of
the U.S. trade deficit may lead to renewed pressure.
    Currency analysts also warned about an unfavorable reaction
to the seven-nation economic Summit on June 8 to 10 in Venice,
which is likely to focus on the implementation of previous
commitments rather than yield any fresh initiatives.
    President Reagan said today, "economic policy decisions
made last year in Tokyo and at this year's meetings of Group of
Seven finance ministers in Paris and Washington cannot be
ignored or forgotten."
    "The commitments made at these meetings need to be
translated into action," he added in a speech, celebrating the
40th anniversary of the Marshall aid plan for Europe.
    Now that Tokyo has unveiled its fiscal stimulus package,
analysts expected Bonn and the dollar/mark rate to bear the
brunt of U.S. calls for further action.
    Marine Midland's O'Neill said, "pressure will build up on
Germany to take stimulative action like Japan."
    Some Japanese bank dealers warned that although the dollar
could hold above 145 yen for some months it could also come
under attack again if it seems the latest economic package is
not having much impact on Japan's economy and its trade
surplus. Reflecting a longer-term uncertainty, some some trust
banks and Japanese insurers are keeping their short dollar
positons hedged against exchange losses in their foreign
portfolios, while some others have started covering those short
positions, Japanese bank dealers said.

<TITLE>HARCOURT &lt;HBJ> DEBENTURES MAY TRIGGER SUIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Holders of convertible subordinated
debentures of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc threatened to sue
the company if they do not get more information about how their
investment will be affected by the company's proposed
recapitalization plan.
    The holders, none of whom was willing to be identified,
said although Harcourt has urged that they convert their shares
to common stock by the June eight record date for a special
dividend, they were unable to determine if it might be better
for them to continue holding the debentures.
   
    "There are rumors that various houses will bring litigation
if we don't get answers," said a Wall Street source. Officials
of Harcourt declined to comment, citing a suit brought by
British publisher Robert Maxwell whose has been trying to
acquire Harcourt.
    Executives of First Boston Inc, Harcourt's financial
adviser, did not return a telephone call seeking comment.
    When it announced its recapitalization May 26 Harcourt
advised holders of the 6-3/8 pct convertible subordinated
debentures due 2011 to convert into common by the June eight
record date for the company's special dividend.
    Harcourt's special dividend pays 40 dlrs per share in cash
plus a security worth 10 dlrs. Holders would also retain stock
in the recapitalized firm.
    The debentures had been convertible at 34 dlrs per share.
Harcourt's May 26 announcement said the conversion price would
be adjusted according to the indenture covering the securities.
Arbitrageurs said the conversion formula yielded a "negative
number" and thus they needed further information from the
company.

<TITLE>VENEZUELA OBTAINED 300 MILLION DLRS IN CREDITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Caracas, june 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>venezuela has obtained more than 300 mln
dlrs in financing for industrial projects and has also
increased its lines of credit for import financing, finance
minister manuel azpurua said.
    "we can say that we are achieving the recuperation of
credit, but that cannot be done overnight," azpurua said in a
television interview.
    Azpurua said a credit agreement for 100 mln marks will be
signed this week with the german state bank kreditanstalt fur
wiederaufbau (kfw), to finance an expansion of the state
aluminum company venalum.
    The credit will be divided into two separate agreements,
one for 85 mln marks with an interest rate of 6.13 pct, and
another for 15 mln marks, at 6.20 pct. Azpurua said financing
had also been obtained for the expansion of alcasa, another
state aluminum company, as well as for projects in the state
steel and petrochemical industries. He did not provide details.
    Yesterday, after a meeting of leaders of the ruling accion
democratica party, azpurua said venezuela had obtained two new
credits of five mln dlrs each for export financing, one from
credit du nord of france and the other from the midland bank of
great britain.
    The finance minister's statements came as the government is
under sharp criticism for failing to obtain new credits,
despite its insistence on repaying the foreign debt according
to the terms of a rescheduling accord reached last february.
    Azpurua and other senior economic officals returned from a
trip to tokyo last week in which they hoped to acquire new
credits for industrial expansions, but no agreements were
reached.
    Japanese officials also refused to allow a new issue of
venezuelan debt bonds because until the country regains its
'triple a' credit classification.

<TITLE>EQUITICORP TASMAN TO BID FOR MONIER LTD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Equiticorp Tasman Ltd> (ETL) said it will
offer 4.15 dlrs a share cash for all the issued capital of
Monier Ltd &lt;MNRA.S>, currently the subject of a 3.80 dlrs a
share bid by CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S>.
    Alternatively, ETL will offer three shares plus 82 cents
cash for each Monier share, it said in a statement.
    As previously reported, ETL moved into the market for
Monier shares last week, taking its stake to 13.7 pct by
Friday.
    It now holds 14.99 pct, the maximum allowed without Foreign
Investment Review Board (FIRB) approval. ETL is classified as
foreign because of its New Zealand base.
    The ETL cash offer values Monier's issued capital of 156.28
mln shares at 649 mln dlrs, against 593 mln for the CSR bid.
    Based on the current price of ETL shares of 1.05 dlrs, the
alternative is worth 3.97 dlrs per share, but ETL said the
value placed on its shares for the offer aproximates to the
diluted asset backing of ETL as at March 31.
    ETL said the offer will have no minimum acceptance
conditions and will be subject to Australian foreign investment
and U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino anti-trust clearances.
    ETL chairman Allan Hawkins said in the statement that the
shareholding in Monier was a long term investment.
    ETL and its &lt;Feltex International Ltd> associate have
targetted the building products sector as an area of expansion
and Monier fits well with this aim, he added.
    Monier chairman Bill Locke said in a separate statement
that the independent directors of Monier intend to recommend
acceptance of the ETL bid in the absence of a higher bid.
    He also said Monier will not now proceed with the
one-for-two bonus issue announced with its interim results on
March 19 in view of the proposed takeover bids.
    As previously reported, the CSR offer involves a complex
put and call option deal with Monier's major shareholder,
Redland Plc &lt;RDLD.L>, which gives Redland the choice of
accepting the CSR offer for its 49.8 pct stake or moving to
50.1 pct within six months of the bid closing.
    CSR officials have made it clear that they see Redland
taking the second option, resulting in the two companies
running Monier as a joint venture.
    CSR officials have also said they had no intention of
raising the company's bid for Monier after ETL's intervention
became public last week.

<TITLE>VENEZUELA TIGHTENS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PANAMA CITY, June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Venezuela's central bank has ordered
Venezuelan banks and exchange houses to cease foreign exchange
operations with brokers based outside the country, according to
a copy of a central bank telex made available to Reuters.
    The measure, confirmed by a brokerage firm here, has
effectively cut off all foreign participation in Venezuela's
volatile currency market.
    The telex, issued on May 19, was signed by Carlos Hernandez
Delfino, manager of the bank's department of international
operations.
    The telex said the restriction on business with foreign
brokers is in line with an earlier measure prohibiting foreign
exchange houses from selling dollars or other foreign
currencies to anyone living outside Venezuela.
    In recent weeks the Venezuelan government has denied
rumours that it intends to impose foreign exchange controls to
prop up the weakening bolivar.
    But brokers said the central bank's move is seen as a de
facto currency control. "It is definitely a control in the sense
that there's no longer complete freedom to operate," one broker
here said.
    "Gradually they're imposing restrictions and the direction
is towards complete control," the broker said.
    The broker, who requested anonymity, said virtually all his
Venezuelan customers had stopped doing business with him since
the central bank issued the telex and followed it up with
telephone calls.
    He said that before the restriction was imposed the volume
of his firm's transactions with Venezuela was about 10 mln dlrs
a day. "It was a frenetic market, it was really quite active," he
said.
    The broker said he saw no logical explanation for the
prohibition because his firm only acted act as an intermediary
between Venezuelan brokers, exchange houses and banks.
    "We weren't buying dollars from Venezuelans, that's
ridiculous," he said. "They've been on a rampage against
foreigners."
    The broker noted that two months ago Venezuela's central
bank quietly announced that banks doing foreign exchange
business outside Venezuela would have to respect a new 200 pct
reserve requirement.
    In February, the central bank also prohibited trading in
bolivar futures, the broker said.
    "We used to have a forward market," he said. "For a small
currency it was miraculous."
    He said the bolivar, which averaged 20.29 to the U.S.
Dollar in 1986, would continue to slip from its current range
of 28.35 to 28.50 because the central bank was rapidly running
out of foreign reserves to support the currency on the free
market.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>NO REASON TO CUT RATES - BUNDESBANK'S SCHLESINGER</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rich Miller, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bundesbank vice president Helmut
Schlesinger said he saw no reason to lower interest rates now.
    With money supply growth showing no sign of slowing down in
May and the dollar stable or even rising against the mark,
Schlesinger told Reuters that he was not convinced that a
further cut in interest rates was needed.
    The economy is picking up, after contracting by a
seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter from
the fourth, he added. "We may have an increase in gnp starting
in the second quarter," he said in an interview.
    Concerned by the first quarter downturn, the U.S. Has been
pressing West Germany to pump up its economy and boost its
imports, either through fiscal or monetary policy.
    Schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter was
mainly due to adverse weather conditions, just as occured in
1986. Year-on-year growth was thus about two pct.
    He estimated that economic growth for the year as a whole
would probably be between one and two pct.
   "It is not a question of monetary conditions if domestic
demand does not grow strongly," he said, noting that interest
rates are at historically low levels and funds are ample.
    Schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank money
stock growth was slowing down from its recent year-on-year pace
of 7-1/2 to eight pct, well above the Bundesbank's three to six
pct target.
    He said the target could still be achieved but much will
depend on the direction of long-term capital flows. Heavy
inflows, particularly in January around the time of the EMS
revaluation, boosted domestic money supply.
    "There is still a certain hope that the net inflow of
foreign money can be diminished or can even be a little bit
reversed," Schlesinger said.
    A major reason for the inflows was the market's conviction
that the mark was headed higher. "As we can see from the market,
expectations for a further revaluation of the deutschemark have
diminished," Schlesinger said.
    The recent widening of interest rate differentials, the
fact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short period
and an improvement in real trade balances have all combined
towards stabilizing the dollar, he said.
    Asked if central banks might act to prevent a sharp dollar
rise, as the U.S. Did in March when the dollar rose above 1.87
marks, he said this would depend on the circumstances.
    At midday here, the dollar stood at 1.8340/45 marks.
    "Central banks are always in contact about these
fluctuations but I cannot give any answer how they would react,"
Schelsinger said.
    "One has to look at how it (the market) is moving," he said,
adding, "It is not only our own case, it is also the American
case."
    He said that the West German export industry has been hit
hard by the dollar's sharp fall and would probably like to see
some correction now. "But it wouldn't be good to have short-term
fluctuations," he said. "Let us wait and see."
    "It is mainly the strength of the (dollar) fall in a very
short period which was a little bit of a shock, than the level
(of rates) as such," Schlesinger said.
    The sharp rise of the mark, coupled with weak prices of
such key commodities as oil, had a favourable impact on West
German inflation down year.
    Although there have recently been signs of inflation
picking up, he said that this was due to changes in key
commodity prices. The underlying inflation rate this year would
be unchanged, at about one to 1-1/2 pct, he said.
    Schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growth
was longer term, in that the economy was building up the
potential for a possible eventual resurgence of inflation.
    The above-target growth of money supply over the past 16
months had prompted some discussion of the usefulness of
targets themselves, a matter which might be taken up at the
mid-year meeting of the Bundesbank's council, Schlesigner said.
    But he added: "I don't see any great pressure to go away
from it."

<TITLE>JAPAN OIL INDUSTRY DECONTROL MAY LEAD TO MERGERS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Masaru Sato, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Deregulation of Japan's oil industry could
mean hardship for smaller firms and lead to their merging into
bigger refining and marketing groups, industry sources said.
    They said the relaxation of controls was now under review
by the Petroleum Council, an advisory panel to the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (MITI).
    A spokesman for a major firm said, "Deregulation would bring
about a reorganization. If it's a by-product of freer
competition, we have no choice but to accept it."
    The Council is due to close its discussions on June 12.
    The sources said the Council was likely to tell MITI it
should end its 50 year-old protection of the industry. It
should cut capacity to 3.8 mln barrels per day, about 75 pct of
current capacity. Quotas should end for crude throughput and
gasoline output, and oil tariffs should be abolished.
    They said deregulation was vital to promote more
competition and efficiency, and most saw it as inevitable.
    "Deregulation is taking place everywhere. Now it's our turn
to see if we can survive cut-throat competition," said a source
at one major Japanese oil company.
    A spokesman for a smaller refiner said, "We'll have a hard
time surviving, but that's something we must go through."
    "In addition to our streamlining and efficiency programs for
the oil division, we will exert efforts towards branching out
further into other lines such as real estate and travel
agencies," he said.
    Larger companies are also streamlining. Nippon Oil Co Ltd
which had the largest share of refined products sales in the
Japanese market in fiscal 1985, cut nine pct of its refining
capacity in fiscal 1986.
    Cosmo Oil Co Ltd, the third largest seller of oil products
in 1985, cut its workforce by some 20 pct last year, a
spokesman for the company said.
    Between 1984 and 1986, on the recommendation of the
Council, 13 oil companies were integrated into 11 companies
within seven refining and marketing groups to improve the
efficiency of the industry.
    Oil industry sources said this structure was now likely to
be streamlined further into five refining groups.
    "MITI means business. It will urge the major seven groups to
merge into five to build up their muscles," a source said.
    A MITI official told Reuters he did not rule out the
possibility of further mergers within the Japanese oil industry
in the event of the relaxation of oil controls.
    He declined to officially confirm or deny that the
Petroleum Council had recommended deregulatory measures but
said that in principal MITI would encourage a move towards
deregulation.

<TITLE>JAPAN READY TO USE DIPLOMACY FOR GULF SECURITY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan was ready to use diplomacy to help
maintain the security of the Gulf, Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone said.
    But he told reporters Japan should not cut its lines of
communication with Iran and Iraq because its policy was to take
a broad political stance. Officials of the foreign ministry
said Japan had maintained good relations with both Iran and
Iraq, which have been at war since September 1980.
    Last week Nakasone ruled out Japanese military or financial
help to patrol the waters of the Gulf. About 60 pct of Japan's
crude oil passes through the waterway.
    President Reagan said yesterday the threat to oil routes in
the Gulf from attacks by Iran and Iraq was high on the agenda
for next week's G-7 summit in Venice.
    Reagan has approved plans for the United States to step up
its naval presence in the Gulf despite congressional
expressions of concern and he has called on U.S. Allies to help
maintain freedom of navigation.

<TITLE>CENTRAL BANK HEAD SAYS PHILIPPINE GROWTH ON TARGET</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Chaitanya Kalbag, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Philippines' first quarter growth
figures released yesterday indicated the government was likely
to achieve its 1987 targets, Central Bank governor Jose
Fernandez said in an interview.
    The National Economic Development Authority (NEDA)
announced yesterday gross domestic product (GDP) grew 5.78 pct
and gross national product (GNP) 5.53 pct in the first quarter
from a year earlier.
    "I don't see anything on the horizon that should cut it
(growth) short," Fernandez said.
     NEDA said GNP had grown 3.56 pct and GDP 3.25 pct in the
fourth quarter of 1986 from a year earlier. Last year's GNP
growth, put earlier at 0.13 pct, was revised to 1.51 pct.
    "Certainly I do not see any shortage in external resources
and if GNP growth continues at this level I would assume that
domestic resources on the fiscal side would be generated and
would not be a stumbling block," Fernandez said.
    "I think even before the figures came out, simply looking at
key indicators, such as consumption of fuel oil and power,
showed that the economy was on a different track from last
year," he said.
    Fernandez said consumption tended to be heavier in the
first and second quarters because of the dry weather, and it
could drop off in the third quarter.
    He said the most significant sign of recovery lay in the
manufacturing sector, which grew by 9.64 pct, after declines in
1985 and a slow turnaround in the second half of 1986.
    "That is not a seasonal thing, it is secular," he said.
    He said the government had met all monetary targets set for
the first quarter in consultation with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF). It expected to draw down the fourth
tranche from its 198 mln SDR stand-by arrangement soon.
    The Philippines has so far drawn three tranches totalling
58 mln SDRs from the arrangement expiring on April 23, 1988.
Fernandez said an IMF mission would visit here in July or
August to review performance in the January-June period.
    He said IMF repayments were projected to total 1.56 billion
dlrs over the 1987-92 period and drawings only 236 mln dlrs.
Repayments were inevitable and many countries would find their
net repayments to the IMF rising in the next few years.
    "It means that since there will be a net drain on ODA
(official development assistance) accounts the commercial
banking system will be requested to hold the line," he said.
    It is an internal constraint that exists because the IMF
debt cannot be rescheduled, Fernandez said.
    The Philippines rescheduled 10.3 billion dlrs of its 28
billion dlr foreign commercial debt in March.
    Fernandez said Central Bank bills, introduced in March 1984
to mop up excess liquidity, had peaked at 43.1 billion pesos in
April 1986. But their unwinding on maturity dates, started in
October last year, had almost been completed.
    He said auctions of treasury bills, whose outstanding level
touched 95.44 billion pesos on May 20, were going well.
"Treasury bills will remain a basic monetary tool," he said.
    Commenting on the country's foreign debt Fernandez said, "I
think the Philippine debt stock looms large because our own
receipts from exports have not taken the same kind of leap
forward as might have been suitable."
    The foreign debt is projected by the Central Bank to reach
29.04 billion dlrs by the end of 1987.
    NEDA said exports totalled 1.2 billion dlrs in the first
quarter, while imports were 1.4 billion dlrs.
    Fernandez said the government had targeted GNP growth of
between six and 6.5 pct this year. He cautioned that while
growth so far was high the targets had not yet been achieved.
    Fernandez said he saw no merit in arguments by some
economists that the peso, currently pegged at 20.50 to the
dollar, ought to be devalued to make the country's exports more
competitive.
    "By being pegged to the dollar on a basket basis the peso
has already substantially devalued against all of the country's
trading partners," he said.
    On the proposed Omnibus Investment Code, he said he was
opposed to a clause which would allow the unrestricted
repatriation abroad of investments made during the first two
years after the imposition of the Code.
    The imposition of the Code, scheduled for last January, has
been delayed by objections from some business groups.
    "I think any central bank, certainly this one after the
events of the past two or two and a half years, has to be
prudent. This is not the time to throw all caution to the winds
and I'm not about to do that," Fernandez said.
    "It would be ideal if we reach a point where movement of
capital and earnings can be free," he said.
    "We have had one year of reasonably good results. Certainly
we continue to have a fairly heavy drain on our external
availabilities simply by servicing our debts."

<TITLE>GERMAN GNP FIGURES PUBLICATION DELAYED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WIESBADEN, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Figures for first quarter 1987 West
German GNP will be published on June 11 after they were
provisionally scheduled for June 4, an official at the Federal
Statistics Office said.
    The official said there had been a delay in gathering
information for the data, which are expected to show that the
West German economy contracted in the period.
    A spokesman for the Economics Ministry in Bonn said there
was no political motivation behind publishing the figures on
June 11, the day after the Venice economic summit ends.
    "There is no political motivation. It is a purely technical
matter," he added.
    The West German government is expected to come under
pressure in Venice from both the U.S. And its European partners
to stimulate domestic demand as a way of reducing international
trade imbalances and contributing to world economic growth.
    However, government officials have ruled out any further
tax reduction packages to supplement a major program of
stimulatory fiscal measures already underway.
    Helmut Schlesinger, vice-president of the West German
central bank, the Bundesbank, said in Tokyo today that GNP, the
widest measure of a country's economic activity, fell in real
terms by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first
quarter compared with the fourth 1986 period.
     The government has confirmed that growth was negative in
the first 1987 quarter. But year-on-year growth is expected to
be about two pct.
    Schlesinger today repeated the Bundesbank's reluctance to
cut its official interest rates further. Its key discount rate,
at three pct, is just above historical lows.
    West German officials are likely to emphasise at the Venice
summit that domestic demand, which draws in goods from abroad,
is already outstripping export performance, which has suffered
from an 80 pct rise of the mark against the dollar in just over
two years.
    The government has pointed out that depressed exports are
the main reason for the current weakness in the economy, but
says that later in the year stronger domestic demand will
compensate for this setback.
    It expects GNP growth for the whole of 1987 of just under
two pct, after a 2.4 pct rise in 1986.

<DATELINE>    ROTTERDAM, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dutch insurer Stad Rotterdam Anno 1720
N.V. &lt;ASRN.AS> said from July 1 it will own 20 pct of the
shares of &lt;Europeesche Verzekering Maatschappij N.V.>, a
fully-owned unit of Swiss insurer &lt;Union
Rueckversicherungs-Gesellschaft>.
    Stad Rotterdam chairman Lucas van Leeuwen told Reuters it
may raise its stake to a majority interest if the two companies
are found to be sufficiently compatible.
    Van Leeuwen said that due partly to the fact Europeesche
made losses in 1985 and 1986, the 20 pct stake was obtained at
below the shares' intrinsic value. He gave no precise sum.
    The Europeesche, which specialises in travel and recreation
insurance, had a premium income of 150 mln guilders in 1986.
    Stad Rotterdam's premium income in 1986 was 1.17 billion
guilders, making it the fifth largest Dutch insurer.
    Europeesche made a loss of nine mln guilders in 1985, which
narrowed to 4.5 mln guilders in 1986, van Leeuwen said.
    He said the company was on course for independent recovery
and was expected to reduce its losses further in 1987.

<TITLE>DUFFOUR IGON GIVES BACKING TO AGA TAKEOVER BID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>French industrial gas group &lt;Duffour et
Igon> has decided to back the takeover bid by Swedish
industrial gases group Aga AB &lt;AGA.ST>, ending a lengthy battle
between rival bidders from France, Spain and West Germany,
Duffour et Igon Chairman Jean Igon said.
    The board agreed late last night to back the Aga bid and
advise its shareholders to accept the Swedish group's latest
offer of 4,410 francs per share, he told Reuters.
    The other main bidders were Union Carbide Corp's &lt;UK.>
French subsidiary &lt;Union Carbide France> and West Germany's
Linde AG &lt;LING.F>.
    Aga topped rival bids for the gases distribution group in
May by raising its offer to 4,410 francs from 4,000 francs.
    This was accepted by Spain's &lt;Carburos Metalicos SA> which
sold Aga six pct of Duffour et Igon's stock and the right of
first refusal on the remaining nine pct of stock it holds. It
also won over the French Midi-Pyrenees development authority
which agreed to sell Aga its 20 pct stake in Duffour et Igon.
    Under Aga's offer, shareholders can either accept a cash
bid or exchange one share in Duffour et Igon for one bond of a
nominal value of 4,410 francs with a 10 pct coupon issue by Aga
France SA. The bond issue is guaranteed by the parent Aga AB.
    The takeover battle for the Toulouse-based company, which
controls eight pct of the French industrial gas distribution
market, began on April 2 with an offer of 2,100 francs per
share from Union Carbide France &lt;UK>.
    Aga's offer, which puts a price of 587 mln francs on the
company, closes on June 24 and the results will be announced on
July 21.
    Duffour et Igon shares were quoted yesterday at 4,410
francs, with no buyers, after a series of suspensions during
the takeover tussle. They traded at 856 francs on January 9
before the first suspension.

    Santos said a number of oil and gas fields have been

them as having very good prospects for further discoveries.
    Total's reserves amount to 75 billion cubic feet of gas and
5.5 mln barrels of oil and condensate, it said.

<TITLE>POEHL LOOKS SET FOR EIGHT MORE YEARS AT BUNDESBANK</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jonathan Lynn, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>For currency dealers Karl Otto Poehl is
the scourge of speculators, for bankers he is the man who has
played a key role in shaping the world's financial destiny for
the last seven years, and for Germans he is the guardian of the
mark.
    President of the powerful and independent West German
central bank, the Bundesbank, Poehl is likely to have his
contract renewed for another eight years when it expires at the
end of this year, government officials say.
    (Index of economic spotlights, see page ECRA)
    But no official announcement has yet been made, raising
eyebrows in West Germany's business community.
    The ebullient Poehl spent seven years in Bonn in top
ministerial posts under the Social Democrats, now in
opposition, before he moved to the Bundesbank.
    There has been speculation that Chancellor Helmut Kohl
would try to replace Poehl with a man closer to his own
Christian Democrats. But officials noted that Poehl has worked
closely and successfully with Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg since Kohl's government took office in 1982.
    Poehl, the most senior central banker apart from Paul
Volcker of the United States, enjoys a strong international
reputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up.
    Given these circumstances, Kohl will probably overlook
Poehl's past as an adviser to former Social Democrat Chancellor
Willy Brandt, and top aide to Helmut Schmidt when he was
Finance Minister, bankers said. It was Schmidt who, as
Chancellor, appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980.
    In recent months, with the mark's strong rise against the
dollar, Poehl has made exchange rates the central concern of
the Bundesbank's council, a highly conservative institution
which has doggedly pursued monetary policies to prevent
inflation catching hold. Older Germans can remember two bouts
of galloping inflation this century.
    But with consumer prices falling for much of 1986, and
inflation negligible so far this year, Poehl thinks it is safe
to relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on the
dangers to the German economy of a bloated exchange rate.
    "I am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise the
dollar/mark rate have reached a high priority, also for the
Bundesbank, because a further massive revaluation of the mark
would endanger the economy in West Germany," he told business
journalists in Frankfurt recently.
    Ute Geipel, head of research at Citibank AG, says that
Poehl's reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy.
    "Poehl's policy has always been a policy which does not
focus so rigidly on domestic factors, but also on the external
economy," she said.
    An economist at a German bank, who declined to be
identified, said "If Poehl is confirmed in his post, it will
certainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not so
rigidly oriented towards money supply."
    One of Poehl's great struggles recently has been to
persuade the United States to stop "talking down" the dollar. For
Poehl, the significance of the February Louvre Accord was that
the United States agreed to join efforts to stabilise
currencies.
    The Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currency
dealers who said they would soon put it to the test. But in
fact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact.
    "This is because the markets know - or perhaps because they
don't know - what the central banks can do," Poehl says of
intervention in currency markets which can quickly turn rates
round, making a speculator's position worthless.
    Poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalist
in the 1960s before starting his ministerial career.
    A relaxed sun-tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes over
a glass of beer, he is hardly a stereotype central banker.
    He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football and
play golf.
    Poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitute
for correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced.
    "But you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amount
if you strike at the right moment," he said. Bundesbank dealers
are very professional and skilled. "They've burnt the fingers of
many people," he said. And unlike the speculators, Poehl notes,
the Bundesbank dealers usually make a profit.

<TITLE>CHINA SEEN UNLIKELY TO RAISE SUGAR IMPORTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Mark O'Neill, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>China will not increase sugar imports
substantially this year because of foreign exchange constraints
and large stocks, despite falling production and rising
domestic demand, traders and the official press said.
    "Despite rapid increases in domestic production over the
last 30 years, imbalances between supply and demand continue to
be extremely serious," the Farmers Daily said. It said 1986
plantings fell due to removal of crop incentives, because
farmers could earn more from other crops and because technical
and seed improvements had not been widely disseminated.
    The official press had estimated the 1986/87 sugar crop
(November/March) at 4.82 mln tonnes, down from 5.2 mln a year
earlier, and domestic consumption at six mln tonnes a year.
    The Yunnan 1986/87 sugar harvest was a record 521,500
tonnes, the provincial daily said. It gave no year-earlier
figure. Output in Guangxi was 1.04 mln tonnes, the New China
News Agency said without giving a year-earlier figure.
    The Nanfang Daily said production in Guangdong province
fell to estimated 1.92 mln tonnes from 1.96 mln and that the
area under sugar was dropping.
    "Supply of cane (in Guangdong) is inadequate," the newspaper
said. Processing costs are rising and the economic situation of
nearly all the mills is not good. To guarantee supply of cane
is a major problem."
    A Western diplomat said sugar output also fell n Fujian,
south China's fourth major producer, where there was a drop in
area planted.
    He said the rural sectors in Guangdong and Fujian were wel
developed, enabling farmers to choose crops according to the
maximum return, meaning that many had avoided sugar.
    The Farmers Daily said a peasant in the ortheast province
of Heilongjiang could gross 108 yuan from one mu (0.0667
hectares) of soybeans and 112 yuan from one mu of corn but only
70 from one mu of sugarbeet.
    The paper said the profit margin of mills in China fell to
4.7 pct last year from 11.87 pct in 1980.
    Mills lacked the capital to modernise and they competed
with each other for raw materialsX, it added. This resulted in
falling utilisation rates at big, mode{nised mills.
    The price of sugar had not changed in 20 years, the
official press has said.
    Customs figures showed China imported 1.18 mln tonnes of
sugar in calendar 1986, down from 1.9 mln in 1985.
    The diplomat said stocks at end-August 1986 were 2.37 mln
tonnes, up from 1.92 a year earlier.
    A foreign trader here said China accumulated large stocks
in 1982-85 when provincial authorities were allowed to import
sugar on their own authority. This practice was stopped in 1986
when the central government resumed control of imports.
    "As China lacked storage, much of these imports was stored
in Qinghai, Inner Mongolia and other inland areas," the diplomat
said.
    The trader said transporting stocks from these areas to
consumers in east and south China was a problem, particularly
as coal had priority. "How quickly they can move the sugar is
one factor determining import levels," he said.
    Another factor was the quality of the harvest in Cuba,
China's major supplier through barter trade, he said.
    "China bought two distress cargoes last week, for about
152/153 dlrs a tonne," he added. "China is not a desperate buyer
now. But if the Cuban harvest is bad, it will have to go into
the open market."
    A Japanese trader said Peking's major concern regarding
imports was price.
    "While the foreign trade situation has improved this year,
foreign exchange restraints persist," he said.
    The diplomat said domestic demand was rising by about five
pct a year but "a communist government is in a much better
position to regulate demand than a capitalist one, if the
foreign exchange situation demands it."

<TITLE>KUWAIT REJECTS IRANIAN SPY BOAT CHARGES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KUWAIT, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Kuwait, a target of Iranian anger over the
emirate's backing for Iraq in the Gulf war, today rejected
charges that fishing vessels seized recently by Iran were spy
boats.
    "There are no bases of truth to the contents of the Iranian
accusation on the nature of the operations of the vessels
recently taken into custody by Iran. These vessels were out
fishing," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
    It said Iranian Charge d'Affaires Mohammad Baqeri was
summoned by the Ministry yesterday to confer with Foreign
Undersecretary Suleiman Majed al-Shaheen.
    The Iranian News Agency IRNA said on Sunday Iran had seized
seven Kuwaiti speed boats and detained their crew, who
confessed to spying for Iraq under the cover of fishing.
    It said the boats were intercepted in the Khur Abdullah
waterway which separates Kuwait and Iraq's Faw peninsula at the
head of the Gulf, captured by Iran last year.
    The Kuwaiti response came as Iranian envoys toured Gulf
Arab states saying responsibility for security and stability in
the waterway was a regional matter. A U.S. Senate team was
scheduled today to meet Kuwait's Crown Prince and Prime
Minister Sheikh Saad al-Abdulla al-Sabah and the defence and
oil ministers.
    Today's Foreign Ministry statement, carried by the Kuwait
News Agency KUNA, said the recent detention of Kuwaiti fishing
vessels by Iran was not the first.
    Tehran in the past had held back a number of vessels Kuwait
had sought to release through diplomatic contacts, it said.
    "However, Kuwait is perplexed that this time the Iranian
charges are accompanied by accusations that the vessels were
undertaking espionage activities," it said.
    Shaheen condemned the detentions and accusations, and asked
Tehran to free all fishing boats and sailors held by Iran, the
statement said.

<TITLE>SAUDI ARABIA WILL NOT AGREE "MAD" OIL PRICE RISE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIYADH, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister Hisham Nazer
said Riyadh would not agree to a cut in oil prices and would
not accept a "mad" increase that would drive consumers away.
    He told al-Riyadh newspaper, "Saudi Arabia follows a
balanced petroleum policy. It does not approve of a decrease in
prices from current levels and it also does not accept a mad
increase that would drive consumers away and make them try and
find alternative sources (for energy)."
    OPEC agreed last December to cut production after world
prices hit new lows in 1986. They agreed on a pricing system
aimed to stabilise the market around 18 dlrs a barrel.
    OPEC is scheduled to meet in Vienna on June 25, where it
will review its current oil price and production policy.
    Saudi Arabia's King Fahd said last month that he wanted oil
prices to remain stable for the next two years.
    Saudi Arabia is the architect of the current pricing and
production pact, which is backed by Kuwait and the UAE. The
current pact set a production ceiling for first half 1987 of
15.8 mln bpd, and implemented fixed prices based on an 18 dlrs
a barrel average.

<TITLE>TAIWAN CURBS INFLOWS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Taiwan's central bank announced that as
from today the overseas foreign exchange borrowings of local
and foreign banks would be frozen at the level they reached at
the end of May.
    The central bank's statement added that the measure would
be effective until the end of July.
    Bankers said the measure is designed to curb the inflow of
foreign exchange and slow the growth of money supply. They
added that the move, which sparked a record single day plunge
of the local stock market, would limit their ability to lend
foreign exchange to importers and exporters.
    Foreign exchange borrowings by local and foreign banks
reached almost 12 billion U.S. Dlrs by the end of April,
according to official statistics.
    Last week the central bank said that from today it would
reduce its purchase of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40
pct from 90 pct of the value of the contract. It said the move
was needed because of "distortions" in the foreign exchange
market.
    Exporters, nervous about the appreciating Taiwan dollar,
have been heavily selling forward U.S. Dollars on the interbank
market to avoid exchange rate losses.
    Official figures show that forward U.S. Dollar sales in May
reached a record of almost six billion U.S. Dlrs against 5.9
billion in April.
    All Taiwan's foreign exchange earnings must be converted
into local dollars, boosting money supply at a time of booming
exports. Money supply rose a seasonally adjusted 51.86 pct in
the year to end-April, raising fears of higher inflation.
    In March the central bank clamped tight restrictions on
remittances of foreign exchange by companies and individuals to
Taiwan in a move to curb inflows of speculative money.
    Economists and bankers estimate that the rising value of
the local dollar has attracted about ten billion U.S. Dlrs of
speculative money into Taiwan since early last year. It has
flowed in mainly from Hong Kong, Japan and the U.S..
    Since September 1985 the Taiwan dollar has risen by about
22 pct against the U.S. Dollar.
    Bankers said the government's efforts to stabilise the
foreign exchange market were a prelude to lifting all curbs on
capital outflows. The central bank has said the controls will
be dropped by the end of July or early August.
    Foreign exchange dealers said today's announcement caused
jitters in the market with foreign and local banks making heavy
purchases of U.S. Dollars. They said the central bank sold
about 30 mln U.S. Dlrs.
    Taiwan's stock market plunged a record 75.53 points to
close at 1,803.08.

<TITLE>U.K. RESERVES SHOW RECORD UNDERLYING RISE IN MAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Britain's gold and currency reserves rose
a record underlying 4.76 billion dlrs in May, following April's
2.9 billion dlrs increase, the Treasury said.
    The underlying trend indicates the level of recent Bank of
England intervention on currency markets to curb sterling's
strength. It was above market expectations which had been for a
rise of between one billion and three billion dlrs.
    The Treasury declined comment on the figures.
    Actual reserves rose 4.87 billion dlrs in May, compared
with April's 2.8 billion increase, to a total value of 34.68
billion dlrs, compared with 29.81 billion at the end of April.
    Borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were 238 mln
dlrs, against April's 66 mln. Repayments under the scheme were
85 mln dlrs, after 90 mln previously, with capital repayments
of eight mln, after three mln last month.
    Repayments of government debt amounted to 33 mln dlrs.
    The underlying reserves increase is net of borrowings and
repayments.
    It was larger than the previous record 3.04 billion dlrs
rise seen in October 1977. The May increase represents the
seventh monthly rise, with reserves up 9.947 billion dlrs in
that period, and up 9.816 billion since the start of 1987.

<TITLE>WORLD BANK CAN AID PHILIPPINES' LAND DEVELOPMENT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Chaitanya Kalbag, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The World Bank's policies prevent it from
lending money for the transfer of land from landowners to the
landless, but it can help finance development of the
Philippines' proposed land reform program, a bank official
said.
    "The World Bank by its established policies cannot use its
resources to finance the transfer of assets from one group to
another. Our mandate is to finance investment-related
activities," Rolando Arrivillaga, the bank's resident
representative in the Philippines, told Reuters in an
interview.
    Arrivillaga said he wanted to clarify part of a report by a
World Bank mission that came in March to review the land reform
program and which said the bank would not be able to finance
compensation payments for the transfer of land.
    He said the Philippine government had never asked the bank
to finance land transfers, and the bank's position should not
be taken to mean that it ruled out any lending for the program.
    "Clearly in the case of land reform the question of land
transfer by definition is transferring assets from the landed
to the landless," Arrivillaga said. "However, the bank as an
institution can finance the development aspects of the program."
    "We will deal with the part of the program that deals with
how to put the land to effective use once it has been
transferred and how to make the on-farm investments that are
needed to attain the goal of improving the income level of the
beneficiaries," Arrivillaga said.
    "I wouldn't be surprised if other multilateral institutions
are faced with similar constraints," he said.
    President Corazon Aquino's spokesman said last week that
she was committed to launching the program, which limits land
holdings to seven hectares, by using her sweeping powers of
rule by decree before a new Congress convenes in July.
    Presidential spokesman Teodoro Benigno said the land reform
program, estimated to cost about 44 billion pesos, would be
implemented in four phases and benefit 2.64 mln farmers.
    Benigno said the first two phases would complete the
transfer of rice and corn lands and abandoned farmland as well
as the transfer of land sequestered, expropriated or foreclosed
by the government and would cover 1.15 mln hectares.
    But Aquino would not decree the redistribution of large
sugar, banana and coconut plantations, leaving it to the
Congress to work out the details, Benigno said.
    Arrivillaga said bilateral aid donors, who form part of a
consultative group led by the World Bank, might be prepared to
finance the land transfers.
    "I don't think there are fast and easy rules as to how
international sources of finance would behave in a situation
like this, because land reform by its very nature requires rich
financing to be able to carry out the reform in a way equitable
to both the landowner and the beneficiary," he said.
    Arrivillaga said the first priority for the government
would be to tap domestic sources of financing for the land
transfer, but external assistance could be brought in if there
were gaps.
    "In such a fundamental reform the test of the willingness of
the government is how it confronts the domestic resource
requirement," Arrivillaga said. "Multilateral agencies by their
very nature are lenders of last resort. It means they have to
be convinced that the government prioritises the program."
    He said the World Bank had financed developmental costs
under an earlier land reform program launched by former
President Ferdinand Marcos in 1972, and such aid had been
channelled through the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP).
    The LBP is the main implementing agency under Aquino's
program.
    "If asked to do so again and the program is designed to
improve the standard of living of the poor then we would
certainly be prepared to consider (lending)," Arrivillaga said.
    He said the tendency in such programs was to exaggerate the
costs by presenting ten-year perspectives in a one-year
context.
    Arrivillaga said the government could solve most of its
financing problems by devising effective instruments to
compensate landowners.
    Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has said landowners are
likely to be paid 10 pct in cash and the rest in 10-year bonds
with 10 pct of their face value redeemable each year.
    Arrivillaga said any instruments used to compensate
landowners had to be freely tradable at near face value and
added: "The challenge is to devise a system of deferred payments
that is as good as cash."
    He said the international financing community was watching
the Philippine experiment with great interest.
    "They are going to be an interesting model for many other
countries because they opened a dialogue on the reforms to
every sector of the population and even international
institutions," he said. "I think they'll be on a very solid base
when they make the decision to launch the reforms."

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone today
agreed with Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita that a
further cut in the discount rate was not appropriate at
present, central bank sources said.
    They told Reuters the two discussed the subject at a
routine meeting.
    Sumita told Nakasone he did not feel a rate cut was
appropriate and Nakasone expressed his understanding, the
sources said.
    Currency dealers have speculated that Japan and West
Germany might come under pressure at next week's Venice summit
to cut interest rates to boost their economies.
    Nakasone, but not Sumita, is due to attend the summit.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan is disappointed at the recent threats
of trade retaliation from the European Community (EC) just as
the trade situation between the two is improving, Japanese
Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura said.
    "I am deeply concerned that the EC has moved to take a
harsher line toward Japan despite this tangible improvement," he
said in a speech prepared for delivery at the opening of a new
centre designed to improve understanding between the two sides.
    Last week, foreign ministers of the 12 EC nations agreed to
impose tariffs on a range of unspecified Japanese electrical
goods unless Tokyo opened its markets more to EC exports.
    Tamura referred to a 55 pct rise in Japanese imports of EC
manufactured goods in the year ended March 31.
    "I feel this is a strong step on the road to balance through
expansion."
    "While I do not deny the existence of the trade deficit
between Japan and the EC, I believe it should be rectified not
by reducing trade through import restrictions or export
restraints, but by expanding the (overall) trade," Tamura said.

<TITLE>GLYNWED BUYS GALLAHER UNITS FOR AROUND 14 MLN STG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Glynwed International Plc &lt;GLYN.L> said it
had bought all the issued shares of two companies belonging to
Gallaher Ltd, a subsidiary of American Brands Inc &lt;AMB>, in a
deal worth around 14 mln stg.
    The full names of the companies purchased from Gallaher are
&lt;Formatura Iniezione Polimeri Spa>, Genoa and &lt;FIP U.K. Ltd>,
Weybridge.
    Consideration for the purchases, which will be based on the
net asset values per share of the companies, has yet to be
finalised but some nine mln stg of the total represents debt
assumed by Glynwed.
    FIP is a manufacturer of valves and other pressure pipe
fittings in thermoplastics. Its products are complementary to
those of Glynwed subsidiaries, Durapipe U.K. And Philmac.
    The acquisitions appreciably develop and strengthen
Glynwed's strategic position in the thermoplastic pipework
systems market.
    The sale by Gallaher reflects a decision to dispose of more
peripheral businesses. Proceeds of the sale will be used in the
continuing expansion of the Gallaher group. Glynwed shares were
up 5p to 494 after the announcement. Gallaher is not quoted on
the London Stock Exchange.

<TITLE>KUWAITI DINAR RATES FIRM, AID WINDOW OPEN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KUWAIT, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Interest rates on Kuwaiti dinar deposits
held firm in scattered trading despite a Central Bank decision
to revive limited funding lines, dealers said.
    The Central Bank, which last Tuesday shut a daily aid
window through which it lent funds of up to one year, reopened
the facility for three month money, which was available at
seven pct, they said.
    It offered one month funds at seven pct through swap
facilities, dealers said.
    Today's Central Bank action, combined with sales of dollars
by some banks, helped ease a recent credit squeeze engineered
by the monetary authority to stem a rush for the U.S. Currency
arising from attractive U.S. Interest rates and Gulf tension,
dealers said.
    However, as one dealer noted: "The market is still
unsettled."
    Overnight funds, bid at 20 pct at the outset of business,
traded up to 30 pct before easing as liquidity dragged offers
down to 10 pct by the close. Tomorrow-next, for which buy/sell
quotes started at 30, 20 pct, ended at 14, eight.
    Spot-next was indicated at 8-1/2, seven after opening bids
of 10. Dealers quoted one-week at eight, seven against an early
9-1/2, 7-1/2.
    One month rates were at the same level after trade at eight
then 8-1/2. Dealers quoted three months at seven, 6-3/4 pct and
six-month to one year funds at seven, six pct. They reported
offshore offers of overnight at 10, tomorrow-next at eight and
one year at 6-1/2 pct towards the close.
     The Central Bank fixed its dinar exchange rate steady at
0.27933/67 to the dollar, against yesterday's 0.27939/73. The
spot dinar was 0.27930/40.

it announced yesterday morning.
    In a newspaper advertisement, the company said the offer,
withdrawal rights and proration deadline all expire June 30

shares, but if less than 90 pct are tendered, it said it plans
to buy only 49 pct in the offer.
    Boeing said if less than 90 pct of ARGOSystems' shares are
tendered, but the purchase of all shares tendered along with
the exercise of options it holds would give it over 90 pct of
ARGOSystems, Boeing may buy all shares tendered.
    ARGOSystems has granted Boeing an option to buy up to
1,238,311 new shares or a 15.6 pct interest at 37 dlrs each,
and shareholders have granted Boeing an option to purchase up

now outstanding, without taking the company option into
consideration.  A merger at the tender price that has been
approved by the ARGOSystems board is to follow the offer.

<TITLE>BOMB THREATS, STRIKES AS FIJI SEES END TRADE BAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SUVA, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Fiji today welcomed the ending of a trade
ban imposed by Australian labor unions as supporters of the
country's ousted prime minister Timoci Bavadra renewed pressure
for his reinstatement with strikes and shop closures.
    The government welcomed a decision by the Australian
Waterside Workers' Federation to lift its ban on shipments to
Fiji, imposed in support of Bavadra, whose newly-elected
government was overthrown in a military coup on May 14.
    The ban had threatened food shortages of imported wheat,
fresh vegetables and medicines. A direct result of the union
decision would be the immediate shipment of 9,000 tons of rice
and wheat from an Australian port, the government said.
    Shops in Nadi and Lautoka, center of the country's sugar
industry, closed again today in support of Bavadra.
    In Nadi two bomb threats forced evacuation of the
Australian Westpac bank, but police said they turned out to be
a hoax. Bavadra has launched a campaign of civil disobedience
to press for his reinstatement.

<DATELINE>    RIYADH, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister Hisham Nazer
said Riyadh would not agree to a cut in oil prices and would
not accept a "mad" increase that would drive consumers away.
    He told al-Riyadh newspaper, "Saudi Arabia follows a
balanced petroleum policy. It does not approve of a decrease in
prices from current levels and it also does not accept a mad
increase that would drive consumers away and make them try and
find alternative sources (for energy)."
    OPEC agreed last December to cut production after world
prices hit new lows in 1986. They agreed on a pricing system
aimed to stabilize the market around 18 dlrs a barrel.

    OPEC is scheduled to meet in Vienna on June 25, where it
will review its current oil price and production policy.
    Saudi Arabia's King Fahd said last month that he wanted oil
prices to remain stable for the next two years.
    Saudi Arabia is the architect of the current pricing and
production pact, which is backed by Kuwait and the UAE. The
current pact set a production ceiling for first half 1987 of
15.8 mln bpd, and implemented fixed prices based on an 18 dlrs
a barrel average.

<TITLE>U.K. RESERVES LIFT HOPES OF FURTHER BASE RATE CUT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rowena Whelan, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The record 4.9 billion dlrs rise in U.K.
Reserves in May to a total 34.7 billion has lifted hopes for a
further cut in bank base lending rates after the June 11
general election, market analysts said.
    Sterling would have risen on the much better than expected
number but for market nerves about the poll outcome, they said.
    But the weight of foreign currency and gold reserves now
available to the authorities to support the pound should curb
any market tendency to panic if U.K. Opinion polls show the
ruling Conservative Party's lead slipping, they added.
    "We have been intervening to a very much greater extent than
we have done hitherto," Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson
said at a news conference today, commenting on the news of the
record reserves rise.
    He put the U.K. Intervention in the context of the Louvre
accord between leading industrial nations to stabilise the
dollar, partly through direct intervention on foreign
exchanges. "We have been playing a very full part ourselves," he
said.
    But market analysts see the recent upward pressure on
sterling, and consequent need for official sales to damp down
its rise, more in the light of local factors.
    Steven Bell, chief economist at Morgan Grenfell Securities,
said that corporate money has been flowing back into Britain
amid hopes of another Conservative government, after fears last
autumn of a Labour election victory sent it flooding out.
    U.K. Portfolio investment is also returning, while foreign
buyers see U.K. Growth propects and high bond yields as
attractive. They will be strong buyers of U.K. Assets, notably
equities, once the election is out of the way, Bell said.
    Analysts see this pressure as the main hope for lower
interest rates, as the government is expected to try to reverse
the loss of export competitiveness caused by a strong pound.
    Today, however, the pound hardly moved on the reserves
news, dipping on its trade-weighted index against a basket of
currencies from 73.1 pct of its 1975 value at 1000 GMT to 73.0
pct at 1100 GMT, half an hour after the figures were released.
    "The market doesn't want to do anything because of the
election," commented an economist at a big U.S. Investment bank.
    Several dealers and analysts added that market forecasts of
a rise in reserves of between one and three billion dlrs had
overestimated the amount of pound sales that were likely to
have been disguised by swap arrangements or transactions on the
forward market.
    The market also seemed to have overestimated the amount of
sterling the Bank of England bought at the end of May to smooth
the pound's sudden downturn, while some of the intervention
reported in May probably occurred in April, they said.
    The key three months interbank money market rates eased
about 1/8 point, reflecting cautious hopes that the downtrend
in U.K. Interest rates will be revived following the reserves
news, analysts said.
    Government bond prices initially firmed, but the market was
muted as traders worried about the funding implications of
another huge rise in reserves, they added.
    Morgan Grenfell's Bell forecast a half point base rate cut
from the current nine pct level soon after the election, so
long as poll projections of another Conservative victory prove
accurate, with another half point later.
    Justin Silverton, equity economist at Credit Suisse
Buckmaster and Moore, said a full point reduction might be
possible. "Sterling will be held down by interest rate cuts in
future, rather than this active intervention," he predicted.
    Kevin Boakes of Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged cautioned
against over-optimistic forecasts, but agreed a half point cut
looked likely.
    A cut before the election has been virtually ruled out.
    "The Bank (of England) is both worried about the political
problem of cutting rates during an election campaign ... And
has signalled some worry about broad money (growth)," said Robin
Marshall, chief U.K. Economist at Chase Manhattan Securities.
    He said the 10 billion dlrs increase in total reserves in
the past seven months may foreshadow full U.K. Entry into the
European Monetary System.
    But Bell said the authorities would like to see another 10
or 15 billion dlrs in the reserves before joining, if they did
so. But, unlike many analysts, he doubted the U.K. Will go in.

<TITLE>S.AFRICA EXPECTED TO UNVEIL EXPANSIONARY BUDGET</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Christopher Wilson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    CAPE TOWN, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Africa is expected to unveil
tomorrow an expansionary budget for the second consecutive year
in a bid to boost the nation's flagging economic growth rate,
economic analysts said.
    Faced with competing demands for increased military and
police spending and the pressing need for more funds for black
housing and education, Finance Minister Barend Du Plessis is
expected to raise significantly the government's overall
expenditure targets when he presents the budget to parliament,
the analysts said.
    Analysts expect Du Plessis to provide for a rise in state
spending at least equal to the 16 pct inflation rate for the
financial year that started on April 1, while ignoring pleas
from the private sector to stimulate growth by cutting taxes.
    "Fiscal policy has become gradually more expansionary, but
simply raising government spending and increasing the budget
deficit is an inflationary form of stimulation," said Rob Lee,
chief economist at South African Mutual Life Assurance Co.
    South Africa this year is targeting inflation-adjusted
growth in GDP of three pct against an increase last year of
less than one pct.
    Growth in GDP over the past decade has averaged about 1.5
pct, while the unemployment rate among blacks has spiralled to
over 30 pct.
    Economists estimate that the government's spending target
will rise to about 47 billion rand, with revenue budgeted at
around 40 billion rand. This would leave a budget deficit
before borrowing of about seven billion rand, or four pct of
GDP.
    The government, having consistently overshot its own
spending targets for more than a decade, also faces a
credibility crisis over expenditure figures outlined in the
budget, analysts said.
    "The budget is invariably too optimistic on expenditure,"
said Standard Bank Ltd in a budget preview.
    Many analysts in the private sector are now paying less
attention to the figures presented in the budget and are using
their own estimates of expenditure to draw conclusions for the
money and capital markets.
    South African Mutual's Lee believes government spending
will again exceed the budget target and increase to around 49
billion rand this year, leaving a deficit of between 5 and 5.5
pct of GDP, compared with a three pct limit suggested by the
IMF.
    "The IMF limit is obviously going to be abandoned," predicted
one analyst, noting that South Africa has moved steadily away
from austerity measures recommended by the IMF over the past
two years.
    The policy shift followed a dramatic deterioration in the
political situation and the onset of an economic crisis
triggered by the refusal of major foreign banks to roll over
loans to the country in September 1985.
    Against a background of Western economic sanctions, falling
per capita incomes, rising joblessness and high inflation,
government officials say economic growth is the prime
objective.
    But private-sector economists caution that the government's
ability to promote growth by boosting state spending is
constrained by the need to maintain a large surplus on the
current account of the country's balance of payments.
    Most of that surplus, this year estimated at around 2.5
billion dlrs, will be swallowed up by repayments on the
nation's estimated 23 billion dlr foreign debt in terms of an
arrangement reached earlier this year with major international
creditor banks.
    Within these constraints, economists believe Du Plessis has
little room to manoeuvre.
    Analysts argue recent rises in civil service salaries and
budgeted spending increases for the state-owned Post Office and
South African Transport Services suggest that major tax
concessions to individuals or corporations are unlikely.
    Du Plessis earlier this year announced small concessions
for taxpayers in a mini-budget before the May 6 whites-only
election. The poll delayed presentation of the national budget.
    "This will not be a very exciting budget," commented Harry
Schwarz, spokesman on finance for the liberal Progressive
Federal Party. "I do not expect any major tax cuts as all the
sweets were given out before the election."

<TITLE>NEW PROBLEMS FOR WORLD BANK IN DEBT STRATEGY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alver Carlson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The World Bank, in the throes of a
painful reorganization, faces new strains because of actions by
Citibank and others to set aside new Latin debt reserves,
financial analysts and monetary sources said.
    The monetary sources said the reorganization has caused
some bad feelings and charges that promotions and other
personnel actions have been based on personality rather than
ability. It also had some effect in undermining the Bank's role
in the global debt strategy, the sources said.
    At the center of the controversy is Bank President Barber
Conable, whose reorganization efforts are getting some 
critical review from many Bank staff members and some member-
countries including the United States.
    "I think if he were to do it again, he would do it very
differently," said one source.
    Conable, a former congressman from New York appointed by
President Reagan to the senior most position at the Bank nearly
a year ago, has taken the view that the Bank badly needed to be
reorganized and perhaps made more streamlined.
    In this he had the backing of many in the Reagan
administration who viewed the Bank as a bloated and inefficient
bureaucracy that gave money to countries when other free-market
sources of assistance were available.
    However, the Bank had been singled out for a much greater
role under the U.S. debt initiative proposed by Treasury
Secretary James Baker.  That strategy, which called for some 20
billion dlrs in new funding from the commerical banks and nine
billion dlrs in spending from the development banks, mostly the
World Bank, came under profound doubt with the decision by
Citibank and Chase Manhattan to set aside new reserves.
    This move, heralded by some sources as a measure that gives
all parties more time, frightened others, who see it as the
beginning of a tit for tat exercise that could lead to complete
unraveling of the monetary system.
    As envisioned by the latter, the next move would be for
Brazil, which has delayed payments on its debts, to say it does
not intend to pay interest for a very long period of time.
    Citibank and other banks could then decide to stop
financing the country's export credits, the funds countries use
to support their daily activities, leading to an economic
breakdown.
    "Within six weeks alot of countries could be out of
business," said one source.
    Citibank's initial step last month was to set some three
billion dlrs in a general reserve for potential losses on loans
to developing countries.  It was followed by a similar move by
Chase Manhattan some days later.
    In the best of all worlds, the kind of cooperation that was
demonstrated between the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the
multilateral development banks, the wealthy countries and
commercial banks when the debt crisis surfaced in 1982, could
emerge again but no one is expecting that.
    If anything, the negotiations have become much more
confrontational with the debtor countries pressing for more
concessions, arguing that they face growing political
instability if they are asked to do or pay more.
    They are very critical of the IMF's austerity measures and
there is sympathy for their view among the development
community.
    "When you hear code words like structural adjustment and
tightening your belt.  What that means is that the poor peasent
making 700 dlrs a year should drop it to 500 dlrs," says one
source.
    He adds: "And when your hear they should have market forces
at play, that means the level of public services should drop."
    It had been hoped that giving the World Bank a greater role
in the debt strategy might defuse the growing resistance in the
debtor countries to measures that increased already prevalent
poverty even further.
   The Bank, which primarily assists countries in the building
of roads, sewerage systems, education, and other so-called
infrastructure, is viewed in the Third World as benefactor.
   The IMF, however, which essentially forged the debt stategy
following the disclosure by Mexico in 1982 that it was near
default, is considered a stern taskmaster that has little
sympathy or even understanding of poverty.
    But there are doubts about how well the Baker initiative
has worked and about the World Bank's success at bringing about
increased growth in the Third World under the U.S. prescription
which indicated that countries might grow their way out of
their difficulty.

<DATELINE>    COLOMBO, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sri Lanka today ordered its armed forces
to defend the island's territorial waters as India prepared to
send a flotilla with relief supplies that Colombo says it does
not want for the Tamils in the Jaffna peninsula.
    The sudden crisis between Sri Lanka and its giant neighbour
deepened as Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa told
parliament: "We have our territorial limits and nobody can be
allowed to trespass there ...
    "President (Junius) Jayewardene has ordered the army, navy
and air force to protect the island and its territorial waters,"
Premadasa said to a round of applause from the house.
    In New Delhi an Indian spokesman said the plan to send a
flotilla of 20 small unarmed boats with Red Cross supplies to
Jaffna tomorrow would go ahead despite Colombo's objections.
    The confrontation was the latest result of the long and
bitter conflict between Sri Lanka's Buddhist Sinhalese majority
and the Hindu Tamil minority, which has strong ethnic and
cultural links with India's 50 mln Tamils.

<TITLE>LAWSON SAYS LOUVRE CURRENCY ACCORD SATISFACTORY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Louvre agreement by the Group of Seven
finance ministers and central bankers to stabilise currencies
has worked well and needs no fundamental strengthening at the
economic summit in Venice on June 8-10, U.K. Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.
    Previewing the summit, which he expected would not produce
any major new economic initiatives, Lawson told reporters work
remained to be done on improving the conditions for lasting
world economic growth.&#5;&#30;side measures to boost growth, he said.

    "I think it is possible that there may be scope for a
further reduction in interest rates in Germany," he added, but
stressed that he had had no indication that such a move was
likely. He made no mention of Japanese interest rates.
    Lawson said the U.S. Should embark on "a gradual reduction
of its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years."
    He said the February 22 Louvre accord had produced
"satisfactory exchange rate stability," in part thanks to heavy
coordinated intervention of Group of Seven central banks, and
he was "content" with sterling's exchange rate.
    Pointing to the record 4.8 billion stg rise in U.K. May
currency reserves announced today he said, "we have been playing
a very full part ourselves ... We have been intervening to a
very much greater extent than we had done hitherto."
    Lawson said there was a risk that the Louvre agreement may
falter if member states did not implement the macro-economic
commitments underlying the accord.
    "Certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchange
rate stability if countries are seen not to implement their
commitments in Paris ... In this respect." He said the U.S.
Budget deficit was "very important."
    Noting the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by
Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone last week Lawson
said, "what is really needed in Japan is an increase in
merchandise imports. Supply side measures are critical."
    "There is a specific range of consumer and agricultural
goods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which is
wholly unjustified," he said.
    Lawson doubted that Tokyo's partners would indulge in "Japan
bashing" at the summit especially after the economic stimulation
package and the announcement of Nakasone's plans to increase
Japanese development aid over the next three years.
    Japan's more flexible stance on Tokyo stock exchange
membership would also help deflect criticism, he said.
    He said he thought West Germany would instead come under
pressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures to
jack up faltering economic growth.
    In this respect Lawson said he hoped Bonn would bring
forward to January 1988 part of its agreed package of tax cuts
scheduled for 1990. He also called on Bonn to push ahead with
the privatisation of German national industries.
    On debt, Lawson said he expected a three point British plan
to alleviate the burden of the poorest sub-saharan countries to
make progress in Venice.
    The plan, involving concessional rescheduling of sovereign
debt in the Paris Club, was first proposed at the IMF and World
Bank meetings in Washington earlier this year.
    Lawson said he would seek "to consolidate political backing
for the plan at the Venice summit" and hoped the programme would
be finalised at the Autumn meetings of the IMF and World Bank.
    He welcomed the recent moves by Citicorp and Chase
Manhattan to increase sharply their Third World debt
provisions.
    "First, it is a blow for realism. Second, because the market
response has shown that banks have much less to fear from this
sort of move than they felt before Citicorp," he said.
    U.K. Banks should follow Bank of England recommendations,
strengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions.
"They have done it to some extent, they need to do it more,"
Lawson said, adding it was up to the banks themselves to
determine the appropriate size of provisions.
    He also said the dismantling of farm subsidies would be
discussed at the summit. "There is a consensus, which we have to
push further."

<TITLE>CSR SAYS IT IS PROCEEDING WITH OFFER FOR MONIER</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By David Skinner, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S> intends to proceed with
its planned bid for building materials group Monier Ltd
&lt;MNRA.S> despite the counter-bid from &lt;Equiticorp Tasman Ltd>
(ETL), CSR executive director Gene Herbert told Reuters.
    ETL said today it would offer 4.15 dlrs each for Monier's
issued capital of 156.28 mln shares, plus a share alternative.
This compares with a 3.80 dlr cash element in CSR's proposed
bid.
    The proposed offer by ETL, controlled by New Zealand
entrepreneur Allan Hawkins, came after it built up a 14.99 pct
stake in Monier in a 95 mln dlr share raid in recent days.

    Herbert said Britain's Redland Plc &lt;RDLD.L>, which holds
just under 50 pct of Monier, still supported the CSR bid and
had told CSR it is not a seller.
    He said Redland wanted to maintain and build on its
operations in Australia and the U.S., Where Monier has built up
a strong presence, notably in roofing tile manufacture.
    The CSR offer contains a put and call option agreement with
Redland. This enables Redland to accept the CSR bid within six
months of its close or to lift its stake to 50.1 pct in the
same period and to run Monier as a joint venture with CSR.
    CSR has said that Redland will take up the second option.

    ETL has declined to say why it intervened in Monier, beyond
describing it as a long term investment.
    ETL would bring no synergies to Monier, unlike CSR which is
a leader in building materials, Herbert said.
    "We fit better with Monier," he said.
    CSR has said that it will concentrate development on its
core businesses of sugar and building materials after its moves
into energy several years ago.
    Asked what he thought ETL's bid sought to achieve, Herbert
said: "I'm puzzled as to what Hawkins' strategy is. One has to
wonder if Monier is the main target."

    Herbert said CSR had no plans to raise its bid, and said a
higher price would be difficult to justify on fundamentals.
    Monier was trading at 2.80 dlrs when CSR launched its
original bid of 3.50, or 16.8 times earnings, in late April.
    The shares closed at 3.90 dlrs today, down 25 cents on
yesterday, after ETL withdrew on reaching the top foreign
shareholding level permitted without Foreign Investment Review
Board (FIRB) approval. Its bid is subject to FIRB approval.
    Herbert also said that institutions, which are more likely
to accept a share alternative than cash, would have to judge
the respective values of ETL and CSR shares.

    ETL is the third group to become involved in a possible
acquisition of Monier this year. Redland held discussions on a
possible takeover before the CSR bid emerged but the
negotiations foundered on the price.
    Share analysts said that for this reason, they did not
think ETL's intervention would flush out a full Redland bid
although Monier's ultimate fate rests in its hands.
    "Redland is still in the driving seat," said Tim Cohen of
&lt;Ord Minnett Ltd>, adding that Redland would be happier having
CSR as a partner in running Monier than ETL.
    Monier's independent directors have recommended ETL's bid.

<TITLE>AFRICAN BANK OFFICIAL CONFIDENT ON LOAN REPAYMENTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Brian Killen, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    ABIDJAN, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Secretary-General of the African
Development Bank expressed confidence in the institution's
ability to handle potential problems with repayment of
development financing loans.
    Koffi Dei-Anang told a news conference at the bank's
headquarters that loan arrears were only 80 mln dlrs at
present, a small percentage of total ADB lending which exceeded
one billion dlrs in 1986.
    Some commercial banks have recently taken extraordinary
measures to deal with third world lending strategies.
    "We do have difficulty with repayment of loans on time,"
Dei-Anang said. But he denied than any ADB loan arrears were
more than 12 months behind schedule.
    "We have never had a default. We have never written off a
loan," he added.
    Dei-Anang said the Abidjan-based ADB will hold its annual
general meeting in Cairo from June 9 to June 11 and over 1,000
delegates were expected to attend.
    The agenda will include the approval of the bank's annual
report and accounts, but there will be no debate on the capital
increase which is currently being voted on by the ADB
governors.
    An ADB spokeswoman said the U.S. Had voted for a 200 pct
increase in the bank's capital, but other votes were still
coming in.
    In December, an ad-hoc committee of the ADB's board of
governors, comprising 18 African and non-African countries,
agreed that a 200 pct increase was necessary to finance a rise
in lending between 1987 and 1991.
    If the recommendations are approved by the board, the
capital of the bank would rise from around 6.55 billion dlrs to
19.66 billion dlrs.
    Dei-Anang said the capital increase would help the bank
improve its borrowing capacity. "The capital increase is in
effect a passport to the capital market," he said.
    "It will enable us to borrow something like 4.5 billion dlrs
in the next five years," he added.

<TITLE>MONTROSE HOLDING TO ACQUIRE VIRGINIA FEDERAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RICHMOND, Va., June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Virginia Federal Savings and Loan
Association> said it has signed a definitive agreement to be
acquired by &lt;Montrose Holding Co>, an affiliate of &lt;Montrose
Capital Corp> for 20 mln dlrs.
    Virginia Federal and Montrose Capital said the agreement
provides for the conversion of Virginia Federal from a mutual
to a stock association and the purchase of 100 pct of its stock
for 20 mln dlrs by Montrose.
    According to the companies, Virginia Federal has over 700
mln dlrs in assets and operates 16 branches in Virginia.
    Virginia Federal said the proceeds would enable it to
provide increased mortgage and lending services and enable the
company to compete more effectively in the Virginia market.
    The companies said the agreement is subject to Federal Home
Loan Bank Board approval, expected later this year.
    Additionally, the companies said the converted association
would be managed by a board of directors consisting of the six
current Virginia Federal directors and two representatives of
Montrose Holding.
    The senior management of Virginia Federal was expected to
continue in office after the conversion, the companies said.
